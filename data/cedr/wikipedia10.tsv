query	51	the exodus is the charter myth of the israelites. spread over the books of exodus, leviticus, numbers, and deuteronomy, it tells the story of the enslavement of the israelites in ancient egypt, their liberation through the hand of their tutelary deity yahweh, the revelations at biblical mount sinai, and their wanderings in the wilderness up to the borders of canaan, the land their god has given them.its message is that israel was delivered from slavery by yahweh, and therefore belongs to him through the mosaic covenant. the covenant s terms are that yahweh will protect his chosen people, as long as they will keep his laws and exclusively worship him. the exodus and its laws remain central to judaism, recounted daily in jewish prayers and celebrated in festivals such as passover, as well as resonating with non jewish groups, from early american settlers fleeing persecution in europe to african americans striving for freedom and civil rights. jan assmann refers to it as possibly  the most grandiose and influential story ever told. the consensus of modern scholars is that the bible does not give an accurate account of the origins of israel, which formed as an entity in the central highlands of canaan in the late second millennium bce from the indigenous canaanite culture. most scholars believe that the story of the exodus has some historical basis, but that any such basis has little resemblance to the story told in the bible. there is a widespread agreement that the composition of the torah or pentateuch, the biblical books which contain the exodus narrative, took place in the middle persian period  5th century bce , although the traditions behind it are older and can be found in the writings of the 8th century bce prophets.

query	89	testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and anabolic steroid. in male humans, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair. in addition, testosterone is involved in health and well being, and the prevention of osteoporosis. insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss. testosterone is a steroid from the androstane class containing a keto and hydroxyl groups at the three and seventeen positions respectively. it is biosynthesized in several steps from cholesterol and is converted in the liver to inactive metabolites.  it exerts its action through binding to and activation of the androgen receptor. in humans and most other vertebrates, testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and, to a lesser extent, the ovaries of females. on average, in adult males, levels of testosterone are about 7 to 8 times as great as in adult females. as the metabolism of testosterone in males is more pronounced, the daily production is about 20 times greater in men
query	90	thyroid hormones are two hormones produced and released by the thyroid gland, namely triiodothyronine  t3  and thyroxine  t4 .  they are tyrosine based hormones that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism. t3 and t4 are partially composed of iodine. a deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of t3 and t4, enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as simple goitre. the major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine  t4 , which has a longer half life than t3. in humans, the ratio of t4 to t3 released into the blood is approximately 14 1. t4 is converted to the active t3  three to four times more potent than t4  within cells by deiodinases  5  iodinase . these are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine  t1a  and thyronamine  t0a . all three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium containing enzymes, thus dietary selenium is essential for t3 production. edward calvin kendall was responsible for the isolation of thyroxine in 1915
