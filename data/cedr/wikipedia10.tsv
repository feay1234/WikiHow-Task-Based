query	30	shakespeare s plays have the reputation of being among the greatest in the english language and in western literature. traditionally  the plays are divided into the genres of tragedy  history  and comedy  they have been translated into every major living language  in addition to being continually performed all around the world. many of his plays appeared in print as a series of quartos  but approximately half of them remained unpublished until 1623  when the posthumous first folio was published. the traditional division of his plays into tragedies  comedies  and histories follows the categories used in the first folio. however  modern criticism has labeled some of these plays  problem plays  that elude easy categorisation  or perhaps purposely break generic conventions  and has introduced the term romances for what scholars believe to be his later comedies. when shakespeare first arrived in london in the late 1570s or early 1580s  dramatists writing for london s new commercial playhouses  such as the curtain  were combining two strands of dramatic tradition into a new and distinctively elizabethan synthesis. previously  the most common forms of popular english theatre were the tudor morality plays. these plays  celebrating piety generally  use personified moral attributes to urge or instruct the protagonist to choose the virtuous life over evil. the characters and plot situations are largely symbolic rather than realistic. as a child  shakespeare would likely have seen this type of play  along with  perhaps  mystery plays and miracle plays .the other strand of dramatic tradition was classical aesthetic theory.

query	71	a flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry. in the sense of  flowing water   the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide. floods are an area of study of the discipline hydrology and are of significant concern in agriculture  civil engineering and public health. flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies  such as a river  lake  or ocean  in which the water overtops or breaks levees  resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries  or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood. while the size of a lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt  these changes in size are unlikely to be considered significant unless they flood property or drown domestic animals. floods can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the river channel  particularly at bends or meanders in the waterway. floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if they are in the natural flood plains of rivers. while riverine flood damage can be eliminated by moving away from rivers and other bodies of water  people have traditionally lived and worked by rivers because the land is usually flat and fertile and because rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and industry. some floods develop slowly  while others can develop in just a few minutes and without visible signs of rain. additionally  floods can be local  impacting a neighborhood or community  or very large  affecting entire river basins.
query	72	anti gravity  also known as non gravitational field  is creating a place or object that is free from the force of gravity. it does not refer to the lack of weight under gravity experienced in free fall or orbit  or to balancing the force of gravity with some other force  such as electromagnetism or aerodynamic lift. anti gravity is a recurring concept in science fiction  particularly in the context of spacecraft propulsion.  examples are the gravity blocking substance  cavorite  in h. g. wells s the first men in the moon and the spindizzy machines in james blish s cities in flight.  anti gravity  is often used to refer to devices that look as if they reverse gravity even though they operate through other means  such as lifters  which fly in the air by moving air with electromagnetic fields.      historical attempts at understanding gravity     the possibility of creating anti gravity depends upon the detection and description of gravity at the quantum dimension  as of 2019 physicists have yet to discover the quantum nature of gravity.during the summer of 1666  isaac newton observed an apple  variety flower of kent  falling from the tree in his garden  thus realizing the principle of universal gravitation. albert einstein  1879 1955  conceived of gravity occurring specifically in the physical situation of matter and space being together  where gravity occurs as a consequence of matter causing deformation geometrically of outer  astronomical  space which is shaped flat  in  grundgedanken der allgemeinen relativit tstheorie und anwendung dieser theorie in der astronomie and  zur allgemeinen relativit tstheorie  both published 1915. einstein  both independently  and with walther mayer  attempted to unify  einstein s theory of gravity  the general theory of relativity  with electromagnetism  using the work of theodor kaluza  published 1921   and james clerk maxwell  in an attempt to include gravity with quantum field theory.theoretical quantum physicists have postulated the existence of a quantum gravity particle  the graviton. various theoretical explanations of the reality of quantum gravity include the  superstring theory  gabriele veneziano 1968  et al   the asymptotic safety theory  steven weinberg  1976  a quantum field theory of gravity  the non commutative geometry theory  connes 1990    the theory of causal fermion systems  finster 2006  holland 1998 nikoli  2003   the  e8 theory  lisi 2007   and emergence theory  verlinde 2010 . various theoretical addresses to the subject of quantum gravitation include  a macias and h dehnen  authors of a 1991 classical and quantum gravity paper in which they rejected the particulate 1 2 spin of the kaluza klein theory.
query	73	the hypertext transfer protocol  http  is an application protocol for distributed  collaborative  hypermedia information systems. http is the foundation of data communication for the world wide web  where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access  for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser. development of http was initiated by tim berners lee at cern in 1989. development of early http requests for comments  rfcs  was a coordinated effort by the internet engineering task force  ietf  and the world wide web consortium  w3c   with work later moving to the ietf. http 1.1 was first documented in rfc 2068 in 1997. that specification was obsoleted by rfc 2616 in 1999  which was likewise replaced by the rfc 7230 family of rfcs in 2014. http 2 is a more efficient expression of http s semantics  on the wire   and was published in 2015  it is now supported by major web servers and browsers over transport layer security  tls  using an application layer protocol negotiation  alpn  extension where tls 1.2 or newer is required.http 3 is the proposed successor to http 2  which is already in use on the web  using udp instead of tcp for the underlying transport protocol. like http 2  it does not obsolete previous major versions of the protocol. support for http 3 was added to cloudflare and google chrome  canary build  in september 2019  and can be enabled in the stable versions of chrome and firefox  since version 72  january 2020 .      technical overview     http functions as a request response protocol in the client server computing model. a web browser  for example  may be the client and an application running on a computer hosting a website may be the server.

query	75	scheme is a programming language that supports multiple paradigms  including functional and imperative programming. it is one of the three main dialects of lisp  alongside common lisp and clojure. unlike common lisp  scheme follows a minimalist design philosophy  specifying a small standard core with powerful tools for language extension. scheme was created during the 1970s at the mit ai lab and released by its developers  guy l. steele and gerald jay sussman  via a series of memos now known as the lambda papers. it was the first dialect of lisp to choose lexical scope and the first to require implementations to perform tail call optimization  giving stronger support for functional programming and associated techniques such as recursive algorithms. it was also one of the first programming languages to support first class continuations.  it had a significant influence on the effort that led to the development of common lisp.the scheme language is standardized in the official ieee standard and a de facto standard called the revisedn report on the algorithmic language scheme  rnrs . the most widely implemented standard is r5rs  1998   a new standard  r6rs  was ratified in 2007. scheme has a diverse user base due to its compactness and elegance  but its minimalist philosophy has also caused wide divergence between practical implementations  so much that the scheme steering committee calls it  the world s most unportable programming language  and  a family of dialects  rather than a single language.      history          origins     scheme started in the 1970s as an attempt to understand carl hewitt s actor model  for which purpose steele and sussman wrote a  tiny lisp interpreter  using maclisp and then  added mechanisms for creating actors and sending messages .
query	76	liability insurance  also called third party insurance  is a part of the general insurance system of risk financing to protect the purchaser  the  insured   from the risks of liabilities imposed by lawsuits and similar claims and protects the insured if the purchaser is sued for claims that come within the coverage of the insurance policy.  originally  individual companies that faced a common peril formed a group and created a self help fund out of which to pay compensation should any member incur loss  in other words  a mutual insurance arrangement . the modern system relies on dedicated carriers  usually for profit  to offer protection against specified perils in consideration of a premium.  liability insurance is designed to offer specific protection against third party insurance claims  i.e.  payment is not typically made to the insured  but rather to someone suffering loss who is not a party to the insurance contract. in general  damage caused intentionally as well as contractual liability are not covered under liability insurance policies. when a claim is made  the insurance carrier has the duty  and right  to defend the insured.  the legal costs of a defence normally do not affect policy limits unless the policy expressly states otherwise  this default rule is useful because defence costs tend to soar when cases go to trial. in many cases  the defense portion of the policy is actually more valuable than the insurance  as in complicated cases  the cost of defending the case might be more than the amount being claimed  especially in so called  nuisance  cases where the insured must be defended even though no liability is ever brought to trial.      market    commercial liability is an important segment for the insurance industry. with premium income of usd 160 billion in 2013  it accounted for 10  of global non life premiums of usd 1 550 billion  or 23  of the global commercial lines premiums.

query	108	brian  sometimes spelled bryan in english  is a male given name of irish and breton origin  as well as a surname of occitan origin. it is common in the english speaking world. it is possible that the name is derived from an old celtic word meaning  high  or  noble . for example  the element bre means  hill   which could be transferred to mean  eminence  or  exalted one . the name is quite popular in ireland  on account of brian boru  a 10th century high king of ireland. the name was also quite popular in east anglia during the middle ages. this is because the name was introduced to england by bretons following the norman conquest. bretons also settled in ireland along with the normans in the 12th century  and  their  name was mingled with the  irish  version. also  in the north west of england  the  irish  name was introduced by scandinavian settlers from ireland. within the gaelic speaking areas of scotland  the name was at first only used by professional families of irish origin.
query	109	carpal tunnel syndrome  cts  is a medical condition due to compression of the median nerve as it travels through the wrist at the carpal tunnel. the main symptoms are pain  numbness and tingling in the thumb  index finger  middle finger and the thumb side of the ring finger. symptoms typically start gradually and during the night. pain may extend up the arm. weak grip strength may occur  and after a long period of time the muscles at the base of the thumb may waste away. in more than half of cases  both sides are affected.risk factors include obesity  repetitive wrist work  pregnancy  genetics  and rheumatoid arthritis. there is tentative evidence that hypothyroidism increases the risk. diabetes mellitus is weakly associated with cts. the use of birth control pills does not affect the risk. types of work that are associated include computer work  work with vibrating tools and work that requires a strong grip. diagnosis is suspected based on signs  symptoms and specific physical tests and may be confirmed with electrodiagnostic tests.
query	110	chromosomal crossover  or crossing over  is the exchange of genetic material between two homologous chromosomes non sister chromatids that results in recombinant chromosomes during sexual reproduction. it is one of the final phases of genetic recombination  which occurs in the pachytene stage of prophase i of meiosis during a process called synapsis. synapsis begins before the synaptonemal complex develops and is not completed until near the end of prophase i. crossover usually occurs when matching regions on matching chromosomes break and then reconnect to the other chromosome. crossing over was described  in theory  by thomas hunt morgan. he relied on the discovery of frans alfons janssens who described the phenomenon in 1909 and had called it  chiasmatypie . the term chiasma is linked  if not identical  to chromosomal crossover. morgan immediately saw the great importance of janssens  cytological interpretation of chiasmata to the experimental results of his research on the heredity of drosophila. the physical basis of crossing over was first demonstrated by harriet creighton and barbara mcclintock in 1931.the linked frequency of crossing over between two gene loci  markers  is the crossing over value . for fixed set of genetic and environmental conditions  recombination in a particular region of a linkage structure  chromosome   tends to be constant and the same is then true for the crossing over value which is used in the production of genetic maps.      origins    there are two popular and overlapping theories that explain the origins of crossing over  coming from the different theories on the origin of meiosis.
query	111	deoxyribonucleic acid    listen   dna  is a molecule composed of two chains that coil around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic instructions for the development  functioning  growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. dna and ribonucleic acid  rna  are nucleic acids  alongside proteins  lipids and complex carbohydrates  polysaccharides   nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. the two dna strands are also known as polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides. each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen containing nucleobases  cytosine  c   guanine  g   adenine  a  or thymine  t    a sugar called deoxyribose  and a phosphate group. the nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next  resulting in an alternating sugar phosphate backbone. the nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together  according to base pairing rules  a with t and c with g   with hydrogen bonds to make double stranded dna. the complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups  pyrimidines and purines. in dna  the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine  the purines are adenine and guanine. both strands of double stranded dna store the same biological information. this information is replicated as and when the two strands separate. a large part of dna  more than 98  for humans  is non coding  meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences.
query	112	hepatitis c is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis c virus  hcv  that primarily affects the liver. during the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. occasionally a fever  dark urine  abdominal pain  and yellow tinged skin occurs. the virus persists in the liver in about 75  to 85  of those initially infected. early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. over many years however  it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. in some cases  those with cirrhosis will develop serious complications such as liver failure  liver cancer  or dilated blood vessels in the esophagus and stomach.hcv is spread primarily by blood to blood contact associated with intravenous drug use  poorly sterilized medical equipment  needlestick injuries in healthcare  and transfusions. using blood screening  the risk from a transfusion is less than one per two million. it may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. it is not spread by superficial contact.
query	113	insomnia  also known as sleeplessness  is a sleep disorder in which people have trouble sleeping. they may have difficulty falling asleep  or staying asleep as long as desired. insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness  low energy  irritability  and a depressed mood. it may result in an increased risk of motor vehicle collisions  as well as problems focusing and learning. insomnia can be short term  lasting for days or weeks  or long term  lasting more than a month.insomnia can occur independently or as a result of another problem. conditions that can result in insomnia include psychological stress  chronic pain  heart failure  hyperthyroidism  heartburn  restless leg syndrome  menopause  certain medications  and drugs such as caffeine  nicotine  and alcohol. other risk factors include working night shifts and sleep apnea. diagnosis is based on sleep habits and an examination to look for underlying causes. a sleep study may be done to look for underlying sleep disorders. screening may be done with two questions   do you experience difficulty sleeping   and  do you have difficulty falling or staying asleep  sleep hygiene and lifestyle changes are typically the first treatment for insomnia.
query	114	the kidneys are two bean shaped organs found in vertebrates. they are located on the left and right in the retroperitoneal space  and in adult humans are about 11 centimetres  4.3 in  in length.  they receive blood from the paired renal arteries  blood exits into the paired renal veins. each kidney is attached to a ureter  a tube that carries excreted urine to the bladder. the nephron is the structural and functional unit of the kidney. each human adult kidney contains around 1 million nephrons  while a mouse kidney contains only about 12 500 nephrons. the kidney participates in the control of the volume of various body fluid compartments  fluid osmolality  acid base balance  various electrolyte concentrations  and removal of toxins. filtration occurs in the glomerulus  one fifth of the blood volume that enters the kidneys is filtered. examples of substances reabsorbed are solute free water  sodium  bicarbonate  glucose  and amino acids.  examples of substances secreted are hydrogen  ammonium  potassium and uric acid.

query	116	in vertebrates  the pubic bone is the ventral and anterior of the three principal bones composing either half of the pelvis.      structure    it is covered by a layer of fat  which is covered by the mons pubis. it is divisible into a body  a superior ramus and an inferior ramus. in the female  the pubic bone is anterior to the urethral sponge. the left and right hip bones join at the pubic symphysis. the pubis is the lower limit of the suprapubic region.      in animals          dinosaurs     the clade dinosauria is divided into the saurischia and ornithischia based on hip structure  including importantly that of the pubis. an  opisthopubic  pelvis is a condition where the pubic bone extends back towards the tail of the animal  a trait that is also present in birds. in a  propubic  pelvis  however  the pubic bone extends forward towards the head of the animal  as can be seen in the saurischian pelvic structure pictured below. the acetabulum  which can be thought of as a  hip socket   is an opening on each side of the pelvic girdle formed where the ischium  ilium  and pubis all meet  and into which the head of the femur inserts.
query	117	the respiratory system  also respiratory apparatus  ventilatory system  is a biological system consisting of specific organs and structures used for gas exchange in animals and plants. the anatomy and physiology that make this happen varies greatly  depending on the size of the organism  the environment in which it lives and its evolutionary history. in land animals the respiratory surface is internalized as linings of the lungs. gas exchange in the lungs occurs in millions of small air sacs called alveoli in mammals and reptiles  but atria in birds. these microscopic air sacs have a very rich blood supply  thus bringing the air into close contact with the blood. these air sacs communicate with the external environment via a system of airways  or hollow tubes  of which the largest is the trachea  which branches in the middle of the chest into the two main bronchi. these enter the lungs where they branch into progressively narrower secondary and tertiary bronchi that branch into numerous smaller tubes  the bronchioles. in birds the bronchioles are termed parabronchi. it is the bronchioles  or parabronchi that generally open into the microscopic alveoli in mammals and atria in birds. air has to be pumped from the environment into the alveoli or atria by the process of breathing which involves the muscles of respiration.
query	118	self esteem is an individual s subjective evaluation of their own worth. self esteem encompasses beliefs about oneself  for example   i am unloved    i am worthy   as well as emotional states  such as triumph  despair  pride  and shame.  smith and mackie  2007  defined it by saying  the self concept is what we think about the self  self esteem  is the positive or negative evaluations of the self  as in how we feel about it. self esteem is an attractive psychological construct because it predicts certain outcomes  such as academic achievement  happiness  satisfaction in marriage and relationships  and criminal behavior. self esteem can apply to a specific attribute  for example   i believe i am a good writer and i feel happy about that   or globally  for example   i believe i am a bad person  and i feel bad about myself in general  . psychologists usually regard self esteem as an enduring personality characteristic  trait self esteem   though normal  short term variations  state self esteem  also exist. synonyms or near synonyms of self esteem include many things  self worth  self regard   self respect  and self integrity.      history    the concept of self esteem has its origins in the 18th century  first expressed in the writings of david hume  the scottish enlightenment thinker  shows the idea that it is important to value and think well of yourself because it serves as a motivational function that enables people to explore their full potential.the identification of self esteem as a distinct psychological construct have its origins in the work of philosopher and psychologist  geologist  anthropologist william james  1892 . james identified multiple dimensions of the self  with two levels of hierarchy  processes of knowing  called the  i self   and the resulting knowledge about the self  the  me self  . observation about the self and storage of those observations by the i self create three types of knowledge  which collectively account for the me self  according to james. these are the material self  social self  and spiritual self.
query	119	shock is the state of insufficient blood flow to the tissues of the body as a result of problems with the circulatory system. initial symptoms of shock may include weakness  fast heart rate  fast breathing  sweating  anxiety  and increased thirst. this may be followed by confusion  unconsciousness  or cardiac arrest  as complications worsen.shock is divided into four main types based on the underlying cause  low volume  cardiogenic  obstructive  and distributive shock. low volume shock  also known as hypovolemic shock  may be from bleeding  diarrhea  vomiting  or pancreatitis. cardiogenic shock may be due to a heart attack or cardiac contusion. obstructive shock may be due to cardiac tamponade or a tension pneumothorax. distributive shock may be due to sepsis  anaphylaxis  injury to the upper spinal cord  or certain overdoses.the diagnosis is generally based on a combination of symptoms  physical examination  and laboratory tests. a decreased pulse pressure  systolic blood pressure minus diastolic blood pressure  or a fast heart rate raises concerns. the heart rate divided by systolic blood pressure  known as the shock index  si   of greater than 0.8 supports the diagnosis more than low blood pressure or a fast heart rate in isolation.treatment of shock is based on the likely underlying cause. an open airway and sufficient breathing should be established.
query	120	skin is the soft outer tissue covering of vertebrates with three main functions  protection  regulation  and sensation.other animal coverings  such as the arthropod exoskeleton  have different developmental origin  structure and chemical composition. the adjective cutaneous means  of the skin   from latin cutis  skin . in mammals  the skin is an organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue  and guards the underlying muscles  bones  ligaments and internal organs. skin of a different nature exists in amphibians  reptiles  and birds. all mammals have some hair on their skin  even marine mammals like whales  dolphins  and porpoises which appear to be hairless. the skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors. for example  the skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss. its other functions are insulation  temperature regulation  sensation  and the production of vitamin d folates.  severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue. this is sometimes discoloured and depigmented.
query	121	speech disorders or speech impediments are a type of communication disorder where  normal  speech is disrupted. this can mean stuttering  lisps  etc. someone who is unable to speak due to a speech disorder is considered mute.      classification    classifying speech into normal and disordered is more problematic than it first seems. by a strict classification  only 5  to 10  of the population has a completely normal manner of speaking  with respect to all parameters  and healthy voice  all others suffer from one disorder or another. there are three different levels of classification when determining the magnitude and type of a speech disorder and the proper treatment or therapy  sounds the patient can produce phonemic   can be produced easily  used meaningfully and constructively phonetic   produced only upon request  not used consistently  meaningfully  or constructively  not used in connected speech stimulate sounds easily stimulated stimulate after demonstration and probing  i.e. with a tongue depressor  cannot produce the sound cannot be produced voluntarily no production ever observed       types of disorder     apraxia of speech may result from stroke or progressive illness  and involves inconsistent production of speech sounds and rearranging of sounds in a word   potato  may become  topato  and next  totapo  . production of words becomes more difficult with effort  but common phrases may sometimes be spoken spontaneously without effort. cluttering  a speech and fluency disorder characterized primarily by a rapid rate of speech  which makes speech difficult to understand. developmental verbal dyspraxia also known as childhood apraxia of speech.
query	122	spinal muscular atrophy  sma  is a group of neuromuscular disorders that result in the loss of motor neurons and progressive muscle wasting. the severity of symptoms and age of onset varies by the type. some types are apparent at or before birth while others are not apparent until adulthood. all generally result in worsening muscle weakness associated with muscle twitching. arm  leg and respiratory muscles are generally affected first. associated problems may include problems with swallowing  scoliosis  and joint contractures. sma is a leading genetic cause of death in infants.spinal muscular atrophy is due to a genetic defect in the smn1 gene. they are inherited from a person s parents in an autosomal recessive manner. the smn1 gene encodes smn  a protein necessary for survival of motor neurons. loss of these neurons prevents the sending of signals between the brain and skeletal muscles.
query	123	testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and anabolic steroid. in male humans  testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate  as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass  and the growth of body hair. in addition  testosterone is involved in health and well being  and the prevention of osteoporosis. insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss. testosterone is a steroid from the androstane class containing a keto and hydroxyl groups at the three and seventeen positions respectively. it is biosynthesized in several steps from cholesterol and is converted in the liver to inactive metabolites.  it exerts its action through binding to and activation of the androgen receptor. in humans and most other vertebrates  testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and  to a lesser extent  the ovaries of females. on average  in adult males  levels of testosterone are about 7 to 8 times as great as in adult females. as the metabolism of testosterone in males is more pronounced  the daily production is about 20 times greater in men.
query	124	thyroid hormones are two hormones produced and released by the thyroid gland  namely triiodothyronine  t3  and thyroxine  t4 .  they are tyrosine based hormones that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism. t3 and t4 are partially composed of iodine. a deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of t3 and t4  enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as simple goitre. the major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine  t4   which has a longer half life than t3. in humans  the ratio of t4 to t3 released into the blood is approximately 14 1. t4 is converted to the active t3  three to four times more potent than t4  within cells by deiodinases  5  iodinase . these are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine  t1a  and thyronamine  t0a . all three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium containing enzymes  thus dietary selenium is essential for t3 production. edward calvin kendall was responsible for the isolation of thyroxine in 1915.
query	125	trichinosis is a parasitic disease caused by roundworms of the trichinella type. during the initial infection  invasion of the intestines can result in diarrhea  abdominal pain  and vomiting. migration of larvae to muscle  which occurs about a week after being infected  can cause swelling of the face  inflammation of the whites of the eyes  fever  muscle pains  and a rash. minor infection may be without symptoms. complications may include inflammation of heart muscle  central nervous system involvement  and inflammation of the lungs.trichinosis is mainly spread when undercooked meat containing trichinella cysts is eaten. most often this is pork  but infection can also occur from bear and dog meat. several species of trichinella can cause disease  with t. spiralis being the most common. after being eaten  the larvae are released from their cysts in the stomach. they then invade the wall of the small intestine  where they develop into adult worms. after one week  the females release new larvae that migrate to voluntarily controlled muscles  where they form cysts.
