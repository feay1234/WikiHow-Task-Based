How do you have a brainstorming session? What are the four rules of brainstorming? How do you have a brainstorming session? How long should a brainstorming session last?  for example  if your team is brainstorming about how to sell a certain product  provide each team member with a copy of the product and then ask them to  go find  other items that convey or describe the product.  break your team into pairs of two or play the game with individual players. provide either the actual product  prototype model or a photo description of the product. for example  if you re trying to sell cars  you probably won t be able to give each team member a vehicle during the exercise. allow team members a certain amount of time to find items and parameters of where to look. you may want to limit the search to the office or within office property. also  since this game could go on for hours on end  keep track of time and allot each team up to an hour  for example to search. suggest that for each descriptive item found  the teammate must write a short statement or draw a visual depiction as to why that item best describes or promotes the product. for instance  if you re brainstorming about how to make dog food seem healthier  you could gather some of the wholesome ingredients and write about or visually depict how real food  not byproducts are in this dog food. ask each teammate or team to create a display making use of his or her items. give teams creative freedom as to how they d like to display items  such as using display boards  tables and any other fun tools. another approach is a visual demonstration using mime  imagery  improvisation or skits  a little  talking  could be permitted but only if it is like a play  not like a meeting discussion  improvisation can force participants to use rhyme  singing and gestures rather than the usual talk . request that everyone walks through the room to see what other team members have found. suggest that individuals take notes surrounding each display which they can use later to come together as a unit to discuss. doing so could take the brainstorming session to a new creative level. for the visual demonstration  simply have observers make notes as and when they like while watching  for later discussion.    sometimes the best ideas can be derived from a film. consider having an inspirational movie night or week  depending on your team size and amount of time  to pull brainstorming ideas from beloved films.   ask each person to suggest one or two films that they feel best describes the topic at hand. films should be easily accessible on dvd and can be viewed at work or at a team member s home. make a few rules before viewing movies  such as film ratings and length so that no one brings in a lengthy  inappropriate film. over the course of an evening  few days afternoons or a week  host movie watching event. request that the person who suggested the film s  write a quick synopsis of why this film was chosen for the brainstorming project. provide each participant with a sheet of paper and a pen to write about why they believe the film inspired or did not inspire them as they re watching the movie. request that each participant provide two to three ideas derived by watching the film on how to sell or promote the topic. collect and maintain a file of the ideas and participant s thoughts. when the team has watched all of the films  have the group review the entire file and begin a collaborative idea writing session based on the thoughts produced by watching the films.    the idea is to write a collaborative story based on a particular topic with the goal of reaching a new creative height. each participant is given directional goals and writing parameters prior to the writing session.  the team leader begins the story by writing the initial sentence. this sentence will set the tone for the story  however as the story travels from participant to participant  it is expected to morph and develop. the initial sentence could begin something like   once upon a time there was a lonely bottle of mustard who was lost on a shelf in the grocery store   in the event selling mustard was your charge . without speaking  the team leader will slide the story to the next participant who must write a specific number of sentences that build upon the initial statement. be sure you designate how many sentences each participant should write. the last person to contribute to the story arrives at a conclusion and passes the story to the team leader. without showing anyone  the team leader makes enough copies of the story for each participant and distributes the completed story to each participant. the participants should read the story in its entirely and then arrive at a statement that describes the story. the team leader collects all of the statements and then the group reviews the statements in order to arrive at a creative slant or way to promote or sell the item.    this brainstorming session may not specifically lead to answers on how to sell a particular item  but may serve as an icebreaker for a hard core brainstorming session to follow.  gather several household random items such as a hat  spoon  mixing bowl  dust buster etc. provide several envelopes  pieces of paper and pens for each participant. set the items up on individual tables within a room. allow for enough space between items and possibly try to match the same number of items you have as participants  for example  if you have 10 people in the brainstorming session  find 10 household random items . ask each participant to stand in front of one item with a piece of paper and a pen. request that the participant study the item for a few minutes  taking in its features. ask each participant or team to write down five adjectives that describe the item. suggest that instead of thinking deeply about which adjectives would work best  to just write down words that quickly come to mind. give participants a certain amount of time to write down their words and then ask everyone to move to a new item until everyone has describe each item in the room. request that each participant or team place their piece s  of paper in the envelope and place the envelope either in a hat or on the table. mix up the envelopes. invite a participant to randomly select one envelope. the group should study the word list and then have to find the item in the room that is being described.    hand out art smocks and easels with paper and paints markers to each participant. tell them to paint several images that come to mind when particular objects  words or anything else is shown to them.   tell each participant that artistic ability is not being judged. they are free to paint  draw  squiggle  doodle  etc.  however they like  whatever comes to mind. in fact  they re not to delay  as it s their initial ideas that count most. at the end  pass the images around the group to gauge other people s thoughts and to see what new inspiration arises as a result of the images team members have drawn or painted.

country to provide microloans to small businesses  startups included  but most of the lenders only lend in designated geographical areas.take a look at the list of intermediaries at https

do it. writing a business plan will help you seem credible and help you obtain funding. there s an art to writing a business plan  but the basic portions of the plan include the summary. you ll talk about the location of the business  the mission statement  the products you offer  and the purpose of the business plan  in this case  getting funding . a company description  including the legal form of the business  it s history  growth  and your short and long term goals. a detailed overview of your products and services  including new products not yet introduced. a market analysis  which includes information on total market size  your share of the market  and how you plan on growing. your overall market strategy. your financial plan  including projections with and without the funding you re seeking.    the various intermediaries have some leeway with respect to crafting their approval process. once you ve found some lenders servicing your area call them or go to their website and learn about their requirements for loan approval. some common requirements include    a business plan it helps if you ve already got a business plan  but if you don t  nearly all of the lenders will assist you in crafting one. the business plan not only helps the lender understand your business goals  it helps you develop realistic expectations for the future of your startup.collateral for the loan. since most of the microloan borrowers don t have a business track record  incomes  or credit history that would support a conventional loan  the lender wants assurances that the borrower is serious about the success of the business venture. collateral can be items like cars  real estate  jewelry  or equipment you plan to buy with the proceeds of the loan.an alternate source of income. almost all of the lenders will require the borrower to have an alternative source of income in case of default.    although microlenders are more lenient with respect to credit scores than conventional lenders  they still have to make sure borrowers can pay them back  and the easiest way to make it appear as though you won t be able to pay them back is to be behind in your current accounts.this includes back taxes. if you do owe back taxes  you should at least get current on a payment plan before trying to get a loan.    microlenders do their best to consider the whole person and their fitness for leading their proposed business venture. one of the ways they measure a borrower s commitment is by checking up on the details associated with business ownership. one of those details is finding out whether the borrower has requested an employer identification number  or ein  from the irs.the ein is like the social security number for a business. having an ein is a prerequisite to legally employing workers in the us. any serious business owner will need one sooner than later. request an ein at https   www.irs.gov businesses small businesses self employed apply for an employer identification number ein online.    in the same vein as the ein  you should take steps to register your business. there are pros and cons to the various types of business formats  but the worst one is the sole proprietorship  which is the default. if your business is organized as a sole proprietorship  it means you are personally obligated to satisfy the business  liabilities.   look into the corporate and limited liability company  llc  formats instead. an llc will probably be the best for a small business  but your circumstances might indicate otherwise. if you need a more

get  so divide your launch plan into phases. each phase should get the business to a stage where it s making more money than it s spending. that doesn t mean it s making as much money as you want it to be making  or that it can support you or your family. all it means is that you ve gotten to a level of sustainability.for example  if you can only get  5 000 of the  10 000 you were requesting  you need to have a plan formulated  call it phase 1  where  5 000 can get you off the ground and to sustainability.    a crowdfunding campaign showcases an entrepreneur s idea to the public  asking for contributions to make the entrepreneur s vision into reality. in order to do that effectively  the crowd needs to be convinced the entrepreneur s vision is something to be pursued.you have to do more than just tell your story. the crowd needs to identify with the story you re telling. your good idea gets them to listen to you and give you their time  but it s your story that gets them to give to you at the exclusion of everyone else. so  if you started selling prosthetic limbs because you lost your leg in iraq  tell the story of how you lost your leg and how it lead you to want to create better products.    a crowdfunding campaign isn t promising a return on investment. it offers the chance to help fund the development of a project for the donor to feel like they are part of the story you told so well. but they don t want to be a part of a tragedy or a farce  so they can t feel like they re wasting their money. to avoid that  you need to appear knowledgeable and competent.even if you don t realize it  you re already the world s foremost authority on your project. still  you need to organize your thinking about it. learn it cold. you ll know you re ready when you know it so well you can immediately and fluently explain to anyone what your goals and projections are at six months  one year  eighteen months and two years from startup. turn yourself into a walking infomercial business plan.    you want to create buzz around your campaign  because campaigns with buzz make the most money. one way to create buzz is by setting and meeting funding goals. set goals at intervals like 10   25   50   and so on. in order to meet your milestones  lean heavily on your personal network  especially in the beginning . hit up the usual suspects  like your immediate family and your regular circle of friends  but don t stop there. that facebook friend from high school you haven t spoken to in six years  there s never been a better time to catch up.do something special for your donors when you reach each milestone. the quicker you hit milestones  the more momentum you ll have  and the more funding you ll get. for example  if your crowdfunding goal is to open a restaurant  you could send each of your donors a sweet treat from your kitchen when you hit each milestone. even if your donors are mostly friends and family in the beginning  that s ok. treating them like customers makes you seem more professional.    most people s personal networks aren t large enough to get them all the way to their funding goal. so once you ve tapped your personal networks  kick it up a notch. begin your social media campaign in earnest after you ve hit a milestone or two. there s nothing sadder than going to the landing page of a crowdfunding appeal and seeing that no one s donated anything yet.you can try engineering a social media campaign yourself or you can pay a social media marketer to do it for you. if you re the type with 3 000 facebook friends  you ll probably get a lot of mileage from a do it yourself effort. if you re the type with 300  which is an average number  don t feel bad   you might want to bring in some help by paying someone.    the closer you are to getting funded  the more professional and poised for success you need to seem. so  while you might have been able to skimp on production values in the beginning  leave some money in reserve to add polish and increase production values as you go.for example  the longer your campaign goes on  the more important it is for you to attend to things like integrating logos into your landing page and emails and paying for professional video editing for your funding pitches.    many people who would happily send their cousin an email soliciting a donation for their crowdfunding campaign are reluctant to make the same approach in person. many others will have solicited their family members for donations before anyone else.the advantage of going to family for donations is that they can take into account factors like your determination and overall character when considering loaning you money. they also don t usually charge interest. the disadvantage is that you ll probably know them for a long time to come  and adding loaned money into the family dynamic can create tension. there is no helpful script to give a person in this situation. you know your family. you know the kind of appeal they will sympathize with. just give it some forethought  explain the work you ve put in already  and how a certain amount of money will help you get to the goal.    two types of hybrid financing to consider are peer to peer lending and equity crowdfunding. both combine features of crowdfunding with another type of lending  and they can be a good option for individuals who are struggling to get financing in other ways.   equity crowdfunding combines features of crowd funding with angel investing. like crowdfunding  the borrower makes a pitch to a wide audience on an online platform. like angel investing  the investor loans money on the basis of getting a stake in the business. some popular platforms are angellist  fundable  and equitynet.peer to peer lending combines the wide audience of a crowdfunding platform with personal lending. the peer to peer platform vets the borrowers for a minimum level of creditworthiness. if they pass  then they make a pitch and receive a personal loan if there is any interest in their project. some popular platforms are prosper  peerform  upstart  and kiva.  while the terms of personal loans are usually only a little better than a credit card  the borrower can often access more  which sometimes makes them attractive. don t be fooled though  some of the loans have harsher terms than a credit card. just make sure you read the fine print before you sign.   take kabbage as an example. kabbage is a lender that promises approvals within minutes. they offer to lend more on a personal loan than most traditional banks and with less paperwork. the trouble comes when the interest starts to accrue kabbage actually makes loans at 100  interest and more. notwithstanding the fact that interest rates that high used to be illegal  paying them off can require a superhuman effort  and the near certain default can be a quick road to financial ruin.    financing your start up through credit cards should be your last resort. the interest rates are too high and the credit limits are often too low. while that doesn t dissuade many would be entrepreneurs from doing it anyway  it s never a good idea. a great many startups fail before they hit the two year mark  and cash flow usually has something to do with it.

Can you bring evidence to mediation? What are the 5 steps of mediation? Can you bring evidence to mediation? Do both parties have to agree to mediation? Can you bring evidence to mediation? What is an example of mediation?  each state typically has worksheets you can print and use to calculate a custody and child support plan that meets all applicable legal guidelines.you can print as many copies of the forms as you like and use them to draft alternate parenting plans. in some jurisdictions  these forms also must be filed with the court once you and the other parent have finalized your agreed parenting plan.the parenting plan describes how you and the other parent will divide your responsibilities for taking care of and spending time with the child. it may include a general schedule as well as special accommodations for holidays and vacations.    use your work schedule along with other activities and family obligations to create a basic schedule for the year.   in addition to your own schedule  include school holidays and events or activities in which your child participates.for example  if your child just made the all star soccer team  you don t want to schedule time with the other parent who lives 100 miles away on the weekend of one of her games. you also want to include a basic daily schedule  both for school days and for weekends.for example  your daily schedule might include the hours you work each day  while your child s daily schedule includes both school hours and the hours he spends in baseball practice after school.    use your schedule to determine your ideal plan for your child to spend time with you and the other parent.   in anticipation of negotiating a compromise with the other parent  try to anticipate any potential areas of contention and develop alternative plans as well as your ideal. this way you aren t scrambling at mediation when the other parent has a problem with your first plan. consider special circumstances such as holidays and birthdays separately. for example  it s likely that both you and the other parent will want to spend time with your child on her birthday. if that would be feasible  you may want to plan different arrangements for that day in particular.make sure you have objective reasons for your plan as a whole as well as any specific arrangements you want to make.for example  if the other parent is living with a partner who abuses your child  this might be a good reason to create a time sharing plan does not include the child staying overnight with the other parent. police reports  if the person was arrested or has a history of child abuse  or statements from your child s therapist could be used to back up this reason. since you want to be flexible in negotiations  prepare at least three or four different parenting plans that you would be okay with. although you won t necessarily present all of these plans to the mediator  they can help you prepare for your child custody mediation.  once you ve determined how much time the child will be spending with you and how much time she will be spending with the other parent  figure out how much child support should be paid.   most states have a child support calculator you can use to find a rough estimate of the amount of child support that must be paid. you generally can find the official worksheet at the clerk of court s office or on the court s website. a basic calculator for informational purposes  based on each state s statutory guidelines  can be found at http   www.alllaw.com calculators childsupport. typically the parent with primary custody of the child does not have to pay child support to the other parent while the child is spending time with him.child support agreements can t be changed unilaterally. this means you can t withhold visitation because the other parent refuses to pay child support  and the other parent can t withhold child support claiming he bought the child items or otherwise spent additional money on the child.  include documentation for any financial information or scheduling information you ve used in your parenting plan.   you also want to gather and make copies of other documents related to the child s life that have relevance to your custody and child support plans  including any reports from your child s doctors or therapists or school report cards.since the mediator also will be trying to get a good idea of your relationship with the other parent and the relationship both of you have with your child  gather other documents related to these things. you might want to make a brief outline of your relationship that includes significant events  as well as a similar outline that covers your relationship with the child.  each state has its own rules regarding the mediation process and the qualifications for mediators.   some states require mediation for all contested divorce or child custody cases. if you re involved in court ordered mediation  there may be forms or notices you must file with the court  regardless of whether you and the other parent come to an agreement during the process. although discussions that occur in mediation typically remain confidential  some states give mediators the authority to report back to the court certain types of conduct  such as refusal to participate  intimidation  or threats of physical violence.many states require continuous training for mediators  particularly those who work with divorce and child custody issues in high conflict situations. although your mediator isn t there to be your counselor  she typically will have extensive training in psychology  working with people in abusive relationships  communication  and conflict resolution.  although you don t need an attorney to represent you in mediation  an experienced family law attorney can help you better understand the process.   an attorney also can help you identify important legal interests  define the legal standard of  best interests of the child  as applied in your state  and help you avoid common mistakes.an experienced attorney has completed many parenting plans  while you ve potentially only created one. often she can point out holes in your plan that you wouldn t have recognized on your own until it was too late. if you re worried about your ability to afford an attorney  consider checking at your local legal aid or family law clinic to see if you qualify for free or reduced fee representation.    reconciling your personal goals with the capabilities of mediation can help you focus on the best result for your child.   mediation provides an opportunity for parents to work together to develop a time sharing plan that suits both of their schedules and needs. however  the best interest of your child should remain your focus. keep in mind that your mediation appointment is about your child   not an opportunity to insult the other parent or rehash old problems between the two of you.    if you have the opportunity to do so  consider visiting the mediator s office beforehand so you can become more familiar with the location and the facility.   if you and the other parent have a contentious history that includes mental or physical abuse or violence  contact the mediator before your scheduled appointment and alert him of those issues   don t count on the court to tell him  even if your mediation is court ordered. some mediators use a pre screening process to determine whether mediation would even be helpful. if your mediator has such a process in place  he will evaluate your situation and determine whether mediation would do more harm than good.  some states such as california require parents to complete a parenting class before they attend mediation.   the class provides guidance on parenting during divorce as well as information about the divorce and child custody mediation process.  when you and the other parent arrive for your mediation appointment  the first thing you ll do is meet with the mediator who will be working with you on your case.the mediator will introduce herself and briefly explain mediation and her role in the process.  show your worksheets and documents to the mediator and explain how you arrived at the time sharing plan you believe is the best for your child.   some mediators may request this information in advance of your appointment so they have the opportunity to familiarize themselves somewhat with your case before you and the other parent arrive. above all  strive to present yourself as open minded and flexible. maintaining that attitude will help ensure that you get the most out of the mediation process.  the mediator will assist you in comparing your time sharing plan with the plan developed by the other parent to determine where you disagree.the mediator will help you organize the issues in your case  and prioritize them in terms of time and importance. she then will often suggest an order in which you should tackle these issues during the mediation session.often the best strategy is to work on the simplest issues first. if you re able to come to an agreement on those things  you re more likely to have a more cooperative attitude when you move on to more difficult matters.if you have any questions or concerns about the other parent s parenting  bring these up with the mediator. if there are things the other parent could do to help alleviate your concerns  it can be helpful to mention those as well. you may be able to make these conditions a part of the parenting plan.for example  you might be concerned that the other parent is in a bowling league where he drinks copious amounts of beer and comes home after midnight  however  it might alleviate those concerns if he agreed not to go to bowling night when the child was staying with him.    maintain your willingness to compromise and focus on the best interests of your child rather than what you want or your personal feelings about the other parent.while your mediator is neutral  and doesn t represent either you or the other parent  she wants the two of you to come to an agreement. during the mediation  she may offer advice or ideas that you hadn t thought about. take those ideas into consideration and evaluate how they might fit into your situation. keep in mind that any issues you can t resolve in mediation will be decided by a judge in court. if you find yourself feeling stubborn or emotionally heated  it might help you calm down to remind yourself that if you can t come to an agreement  you may end up with something you like even less than the option the other parent is presenting.mediation can be particularly stressful if you and the other parent have a history of abuse or other communication issues. the mediator may assist by using strategies such as keeping you apart and passing information along.if you have any such difficulties or are afraid of the other parent  make sure you let the mediator know in advance.    when the mediator prepares your agreement  read it carefully and make sure what s on paper accurately reflects the decisions you and the other parent have made.if you have an attorney  make sure she goes over the agreement with you before it s submitted to the court for approval.  your signature indicates that you have read and understood the document  and agree to abide by its terms.   some jurisdictions may require you to sign your agreement in front of a notary public. check with the clerk of court before you sign to make sure you ve followed proper procedures. after you ve signed your agreement  make at least one copy for yourself and the other parent   the clerk will keep the original for the court s files.    before your agreed parenting plan can go into effect  you must file it with the clerk of the same court where your original divorce or custody action is filed so the judge can approve it.   you must pay fees to have your agreement filed and approved by the court. if you worry you won t be able to afford the fees  ask the clerk if you can have an application for a waiver. if you meet the court s income and asset requirements  the judge will approve your application and you won t have to pay any court costs for your case.  some judges may schedule a hearing to ask you questions about the agreement and make sure that you understand its terms.   typically if both parents agree to the parenting plan  the judge will approve it. however  she may want to talk to you first and make sure both of you understand the terms of the plan and agree to follow it.

How many pull ups should I do to do a muscle up? How often should you do pull ups?  when it s time to execute your one armed pullup  don t try to do it after a back workout or arm workout of any kind. it will be the hardest move in your routine  so you want your muscles to have all of their energy.try a little cardio to warm you up first  then roll out your muscles with a ball or foam roller.    some people prefer the palm to face toward you  which is technically more of a chin up but makes the move a bit easier to execute.   you can stand facing the bar or turn so that the bar is next to your lifting arm. try different techniques to see what feels comfortable.    you will only need to do this the first few times  but it will help support your lifting arm and also give you a little extra lifting power.think of your non lifting arm as the  support arm  and only use it as needed. try to rely on the lifting arm to do most of the work  but use the support arm to help pull yourself up.    instead of holding your wrist  or once you ve accomplished a pullup using a supporting arm  swing your non lifting arm a bit.   this will give your body momentum  which makes that first rep a bit easier.  bend your arm at the elbow and focus your lifting between your shoulder blades and across your arm muscles.   lift all the way up  until your head passes the bar. be careful not to hit yourself on the chin on your way down  it can help to bend your legs under you  crossing your ankles. this gives your body more stability than if you let your legs flail.    you won t be able to do many in the beginning   maybe only one   so go till your muscles won t do any more.wait three minutes before trying another set.    before you can do regular pull ups  and especially before mastering the much more challenging one armed pull up  you need to build strength in your arms. there are many exercises you can do to help build muscle mass and strength in the arms    work on one armed lat pulldowns. you need to train on a lat pulldown machine to execute this move  which involves sitting on a bench and pulling a weighted handle down to your chest.start at comfortable weight  which will vary depending on your fitness level   but work up to two to three repetitions using 20 or 30 percent more weight than your body weight. for example  if you weigh 150  your goal will be to accomplish 2 3 repetitions lifting 180 195 pounds.be sure to work both arms equally at each training session. try the bench press. bench pressing weight engages both your chest and your arms  which are both players in proper pull ups. you can start with just the bar if you have no arm strength  or as much weight as you can manage. gradually add more weight over the course of a few weeks to increase muscle mass and strength.master push ups. push ups engage your arms  chest  and back  and can help strengthen your arms for pull ups. once you ve mastered regular push ups  learn the one armed push up and be sure to master it with both arms.    contrary to what you might have heard  the arms are not the most important muscle group involved in executing a pull up. in fact  the serratus anterior  sa  muscle  located on your back under your shoulder blades  holds all the muscles together that are needed for executing a pull up. if yours is not correctly conditioned  your shoulder blades are out of position and pull ups are next to impossible to execute  no matter how strong your arms.soften the sa and surrounding muscles first  by using a lacrosse ball  tennis ball  or foam roller to release tension and get your muscles in the right position. laying on a mat or rubber floor  or learning against a wall  roll the ball hard against your muscles across your pectorals  your chest   teres muscles  directly behind and in your armpits   and sa muscles. roll gently at first  then increase pressure in tender spots.strengthen your back and particularly your sa muscles by focusing on back exercises such as downward facing dog  push ups  reverse flys  and cable rows.    you will need to be able to do more than 25 strict pull ups before you learn the one arm pull up. using the proper form is crucial as you learn how to do this in order to avoid injury and maximize the benefit of the workout.   using an overhand grip and keeping your hands about shoulder distance apart  hang from a pull up bar with your arms extended. slowly raise your body by bending the elbows  bringing your chest as close to the bar as you can. slowly lower yourself back to arms extended.be sure to exercise different grips. you can do chin ups  which are like typical pull ups but with your hands slightly closer together and your palms facing towards you. you can also try widening your grip to engage the back muscles. once you ve mastered regular pull ups  introduce a new challenge by raising yourself with two arms but lowering yourself with only one  alternating arms at each pull. this gets you one step closer to full one armed pullups.  you will probably never meet someone that can do over 20 pull ups who hasn t exercised weighted pull ups.   start with a very small amount of additional weight  only one or two pounds  then gradually add more as you master each level. you can wear leg weights  attach weight to a belt  or even put it in a backpack.    it takes a lot of dedication to start with a regular two arm pull up  which is hard enough for most people  and reach the one arm pull up.   having a regular exercise schedule and a plan for increasing your weights and repetitions can be helpful. it can also be helpful to enlist a trainer or friend to motivate you and keep you accountable.    once you ve mastered the basic one armed pull up  you can gradually train your muscles to handle even more pressure.   start with just a bit of weight. one or two pounds makes a lot of difference with this difficult move.    this will increase your arm strength beyond body weight exercises.   make sure to use proper form and no swinging and to progress slowly with the weights. do them with slowly with more time under tension.    this will target your bicep long head. make sure you do this with the full range of motion so you teach your bicep to work hard when its fully extended.    this will activate your deltoids and upper chest which are used in the one arm pull up.    take all the exercises listed in previous steps and do them with heavier weight  except now let the weight down as slowly as you can.   this will train the muscles to be able to endure a lot of pressure with time under tension which is important in the one arm pull up chin up.    it is a great exercise to improve bicep strength and endurance that is needed in the one arm pull up.   every person who can do at least a single one arm pull up will be tough in arm wrestling. it is not a coincidence. if you want to get better at either exercise  do the other one. grab a friend or a relative who is stronger than you and practice.

query	18	on the road follow  the key to being organized is preparation  so you ll need to consider several factors before implementing your ideas    identify the vehicle you will be using to take your road trip. is it a large  roomy suv or a small car  obviously  the vehicle size will be extremely important in planning what  or how much  you can take and trying to stuff more into a car that has very little room will make life harder for you.       make a list of the vehicle occupants. if you can fit everyone in your vehicle comfortably  along with their suitcase and one travel and activity bag  you should be fine for the road trip. if you think you may be cramped  consider renting a larger vehicle for your trip if possible  especially if you will be car bound for more than one day.       consider your final destination. will you be heading somewhere cold or a tropical paradise  do your accommodations have a washer and dryer and how many days will you be gone  also  do you need to pack equipment for your vacation such as skis or a surfboard  knowing as much about your accommodations as possible will help you determine if you can pack a smaller sized suitcase  if you re heading to the beach where you have access to a washer and dryer  or if there s no way around it and you must pack for each day. also  consider renting supplies  such as skis and boots  if car room is at a premium.       determine the number of days or hours that it will take you to complete your road trip. if it will take more than one day to get to your destination  will you need to secure accommodations along the way  if you will need overnight accommodations  conduct online research to identify hotels along your route and make a reservation for each night you need lodging. don t assume availability  all it takes is one wedding party to fill up the only motel in town.       obtain directions or a map. if you don t have a gps system  print directions using a mapping website or visit your local travel club  like aaa  and obtain a map.gps systems are not always available obtain a map.          the best way to stay in control while on the road is to allow each passenger one small bag  roughly the size of a backpack  in which they can pack games  books and electronic devices.   provide children with a specific list of what they can and cannot take in their activity bag. for example  tell them they can take three books  one pack of crayons and two coloring books. the amount of items should directly correlate to the number of hours or days on the road. for a three hour road trip  one book should be sufficient  however  if you will be road bound for three days  asking that they pack several books and puzzles is not out of the question. electronic devices such as tablets or game consoles can carry more books  puzzles and games  so consider taking one to share among the children.       ask adults to ensure they have all important documentation included inside their travel bag. maps  day planners  confirmation numbers and tickets should be secured in their bag. medication should be in the bag too  to avoid having to rummage through the back for it when needed.          at the end of a 12 hour driving stint  the last thing you want to do is drag heavy luggage to a room for a quick rest. instead  determine the number of days you will be on the road  and pack a travel bag that includes enough fresh clothing and toiletries for the number of days on the road. pack a plastic garbage bag inside one of the passenger s bags and for dirty clothes each evening  that way  you keep the dirty clothes worn during the day separate from the rest of your items.    the only way you will calm the chaos is to establish a few general car rules and ask everyone to kindly adhere to them throughout the trip. some rules that have proven their worth for others taking road trips include    trash is thrown away at every stop. request that every passenger search their area for cups  napkins  bags etc. and dispose of it every time the car stops. this will avoid mountains of trash building up and unidentified squashed objects being smushed into the hard to reach places of the car.       maintain a small trash receptacle in the car. keep a small garbage bag in the front seat and ask that each passenger use it after snacks or meals. this will help to minimize the amount of rogue trash in the car. empty this bag at every stop.       shoes must be kept by each passenger. although everyone loves to take off their shoes during a road trip  demand that shoes be kept on the ground by the passenger to prevent missing shoes . also  if your feet stink  shoes must be worn at all times unless they re a cherubic toddler with no foot odor. alternatively  bring foot spray to kill odors.       passenger space must be maintained and organized at each stop. if the kids want to color in the car or play with toys  fine. however  they must understand that once the car stops they must return whatever they ve taken out of their activity bag back to its original spot.       each passenger should perform a mental checklist after every stop. to ensure that items are not lost during the road trip  ask that each passenger double check important items that should be in their activity bag such as cash  maps and favorite toys  for example. the last thing you want is to be an hour away from the last stop only to realize you left tickets or your child s favorite blanket at the last stop.       always check you have your wallet after roadside stops. the feeling of leaving it behind is more than chilling.          anticipating the unexpected will help you stick to your schedule and maintain a sense of order throughout your car trip. assemble an emergency travel kit that can be maintained either underneath a car seat or in the trunk  but in an accessible area so it can be accessed if needed while the car is in motion . items to consider include    over the counter and or prescription medication. also  don t forget important medicines such as an epi pen or migraine medication if you have allergies or are prone to sudden extreme headaches       bandages and band aids. include various sizes and special blister band aids       antibiotic cream and anti itch cream       antibacterial waterless soap or wipes       diapers and wipes  if a baby is traveling with you        small can of insect repellant       digital thermometer       leak proof plastic bag. whether someone has to vomit or if they have to use the toilet and you can t get off the road  it s better than having the offensive matter strew all over the vehicle. don t forget to dispose of the plastic bag immediately at the next stop       small can of air freshener  for a more pleasant ride       one 8 ounce bottle of water  you never know when or if you may need water to clean up messes or wash wounds.          sometimes events happen that are beyond your control. learn to relax and go with the flow if your trip becomes disorganized  think of it as making fond memories that you ll laugh about in years to come . you can always regroup at overnight stops  do it first thing in the morning when you re most refreshed and least likely to despair over the state of the car .

Should runners drink milk? What foods make you run faster? What food should runners avoid? What foods make you run faster? What gives you energy to run?   make sure you stretch before you start to run.  before you can increase your speed  it is important to time how fast you are currently running  so you can accurately measure your progress. use a stopwatch to time how long it takes you to run a mile. once you have an exact time   whether it s 8 minutes or 16 minutes   you can work on improving it    this is where running on a track comes in handy  as each 400m lap of the track is equal to 1 4 of a mile  so four laps of the track is equal to one mile. if you don t have access to a track  measure an exact mile on a stretch of flat  traffic free road  then use that to time your run. you should also try to measure the number of strides you take in a minute. you can do this by giving yourself a minute on the clock  then counting the number of times your right foot hits the ground as you run. whatever number you come up with  you should try to double it as you increase your running speed.    find a local track or flat surface of about 1 4 mile  400 meters  to run on. tracks are an ideal place for beginner runners looking to increase their speed  as they are a standard length   400 meters   which allows you to easily measure your progress. they are also traffic free and flat.local schools will often open up their tracks to the public  which is convenient if you don t have access to a track elsewhere.if you cannot conveniently make it to a track  you can also improve your running speed on a treadmill at the gym or on any flat road with minimal traffic.avoid curved or uneven streets  as their shape will affect your running. for example  on a curved street the curb foot will be noticeably lower than the street side foot.    increasing your running speed will require a lot of discipline and dedication  so it s important that you set yourself a challenging yet realistic schedule and stick to it. you should aim to be running at least 4 to 5 times a week  varying the length and intensity of your runs.   this will not only help you stay on track to running faster  it will also give you an opportunity to gather metrics  do you maintain a steady pace  are you continuing to speed up  or have you reached a plateau     it is important to have a specific goal in mind as you are training to run faster. having a goal will increase your motivation and force you to push yourself that little bit harder in order to attain it. whatever goal you choose  it should be challenging but realistic.   you can set a goal which involves running a certain distance in a specific length of time   for example  your goal could be to run a mile in 8 minutes. alternatively  you could set yourself a goal which involves increasing the number of steps you take in a minute  or your cadence. the fastest runners in the world have an average cadence of around 180 steps per minute. to find your ideal cadence goal  run for 60 seconds  counting the number of times your right foot hits the ground. then double this number to find your target goal      the right running gear   shoes  clothes etc.   though not essential to increasing your running speed  can definitely help to make you feel lighter on your feet. there are a huge array of running shoes available nowadays  many with an emphasis on mimicking the feel and movement of barefoot running.   lightweight  breathable clothing can also help you to feel cooler and less weighed down while running  both physically and mentally. you may also want to invest in a high tech watch that you can use to accurately time your runs  while also measuring distance  speed  calories burned and heart rate.    getting a friend involved in your new fitness plan can really help to up your motivation levels. whether your friend intends to run with you  or act as your personal trainer  having some one else along for the ride will ensure that you don t quit and may even provide some healthy competition.    if you re struggling to push yourself or stay motivated to attain a faster running speed  creating an inspirational mantra which you can repeat to yourself while running may be helpful. it can be as silly or a cliche as you like  as long as it s a simple phrase that motivates you to do better.   think along the lines of  you re too slow  or  gotta go fast    or anything you can think of really      to help boost both your speed and endurance  you need to push your limits and mix up your workout routines a little. if you ve been doing the same exercises for a few months  your body will have settled into a routine  and it s likely you ve reached a plateau. it s time to shake it up and try some new things     try running on the treadmill. using a treadmill is a great way to train your body to run at a higher tempo. the belt will propel you forward while keeping you at a constant speed  thus encouraging a higher leg turnover. to get the most out of your treadmill workouts  set the machine to a speed slightly higher than you re comfortable with and push yourself to keep up. this will train your legs and muscles to work at a higher speed  even off the treadmill try spinning classes. spinning classes can help to increase your cadence while running by encouraging your hips to rotate at higher speeds. spinning classes will also help to get your overall fitness levels up  making them an excellent cross training choice.  try skipping. using a jump rope increases cardiovascular fitness  encourages weight loss and improves coordination  while also training your body to absorb your body weight when your feet impact the ground. incorporating just 30 minutes of skipping into your weekly schedule can help to get your body in top running condition and promote faster feet.try yoga. for a more low key form of exercise that still helps to benefit your running  try working a yoga class or two into your weekly schedule. yoga helps to improve flexibility  which benefits running form and decreases muscle recovery time   all good news for runners training hard to increase their speed.     maintaining good form while running will ensure that your body is operating as efficiently as possible  helping you to increase your running speed  as well as helping to prevent injuries. running should feel natural and loose   you shouldn t feel tense or taut. here are some tips on correct running posture  which will help you to maintain good form    keep your head up  with your eyes looking straight ahead. avoid looking down at your shoes or tilting your chin up  as this will put your neck and back out of line.keep your arms at a 90 degree angle and swing them back and forwards slightly  to propel your body forwards. don t clench your fists  hunch your shoulders or hold your arms tightly against your body. if you feel yourself doing any of these things  shake your arms out to relieve any tension and resume the correct posture.your hips should face straight ahead  in an upright position  aligning them with your torso and shoulders.the position of your legs will vary slightly depending on they style of running. sprinters will need to lift their knees quite high in order to attain maximum speed. however  most runners  even if you re trying to run faster than your normal pace  do not need to lift their knees so high. to increase your speed  you should simply take a higher number of shorter strides  lifting your knees only slightly. your foot should fall directly beneath your body.your knees should be slightly flexed as your foot lands  so your leg can naturally bend on impact.your foot should land on your heel and mid foot  before rolling forward onto your toes to push off for your next step. good  fast runners are light on their feet and have a bit of spring in their step.   fartlek  is a swedish word meaning  speed play  and is becoming a more and more popular training method amongst runners who are trying to increase their speed. fartlek training involves varying your running pace at random intervals throughout your run. with fartleks  you can run at a jogging pace for several minutes then sprint for a full minute  before resuming your previous pace.fartleks are a very flexible training method  and you can decide what the ratio of jogging to sprinting will be  depending on how you re feeling on a given day. for best results  you should aim to incorporate fartlek training into a 40 60 minute run.most runners don t use very exact methods or timing for doing fartlek training. a lot of times  runners will simply decide to sprint until they get to a particular landmark  like a telephone pole or fire hydrant. the length of the sprint is entirely up to you and your body s ability.it is important to warm up properly   at least 10 15 minutes at an average running pace   before attempting a fartlek workout. this is because you need to ensure that your muscles are loose enough to handle the demands of multiple accelerations. also ensure that you allow yourself a decent cooldown periods  otherwise you could be dealing with some very sore muscles the next day.  running over hilly terrain has been proven to gradually build up speed over time  so you should definitely incorporate some hill training into your workout schedule. running uphill may be harder at first  but after a while of getting used to it  you will find it much easier to run on a level surface  and you ll run at a faster speed.hill runs are actually better for your body too  as they help you to achieve high intensities while limiting the joint shock caused by pounding on flat surfaces.to really get the intensity level up  you can try doing some hill sprints. this involves running up a fairly steep hill for 30 to 60 seconds  at the maximum speed that you can physically maintain for that length of time.  getting the most out of your breathing can help to increase both your running speed and your overall stamina. this is because breathing deeply allows more oxygen into your bloodstream  which gives muscles more energy to keep going. you should inhale and exhale using both your mouth and nose  and aim to breathe into your belly rather than into your chest.   belly breathing involves drawing deeper breaths  which  if done correctly  should inflate your stomach like a balloon when you breathe in  and deflate it when you breathe out. when you breathe into your chest  as most inexperienced runners do  you tend to breathe less deeply  limiting your oxygen intake  and hunch up your shoulders  wasting precious energy .while running  try to time your breathes to the rhythm of your footfall. this helps to strengthen the diaphragm. to begin  take one breath in for every two steps  right  left   then exhale for the next two steps. once your diaphragm grows stronger and your breathing deepens  you can extend this to one breath for every four steps.  something as simple as looking straight ahead while running can actually increase your running speed. some runners have a tendency to look down at their feet or to look around them  taking in their surroundings  during their run. while this is fine for people who are running for pleasure or just to enjoy the great outdoors  runners training for speed should aim to focus their gaze about 20 to 30 meters in front of them  always looking straight ahead.   this is particularly useful advice for runners interested in racing   as it helps them to keep their eyes on the finish line     being fit does not necessarily mean that you are at your ideal weight  especially if you are eating large meals to compensate for an intense workout schedule. it is important to understand that the more extra weight you re carrying  the more effort it will require to complete your run. it might be as little as one pound or as much as ten  but losing the extra weight can help you to run faster for longer.of course  crash dieting is not an option for people on intense running schedules. however  it is completely possible to stay full and satisfied on a healthy  nutritionally balanced diet. in fact  changing your eating habits may allow you to lose weight and provide you with the extra energy necessary to run that little bit faster.to lose weight healthily  try increasing your intake of protein rich lean meats  such as chicken  turkey and oily fish  and combine them with small portions healthy carbohydrates such as brown rice  multi grain bread  or wholewheat pasta. eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables along with every meal  to increase feelings of fullness with loading on the calories. for healthy yet filling snacks on the go  reach for a banana  a low fat yogurt or a handful of almonds or raisins.  although some running purists disdain the need for music while running  studies have proven that people who listen to music as they exercise show a significant increase in their power output  particularly when listening to high tempo music.try to find a selection of songs with a tempo that matches to running speed you are trying to achieve. while listening to these songs  your body will naturally fall into step with the music and your speed will increase without you even realizing it     keeping a log of your workouts is a great way to track your progress and give you some added motivation to keep going when you need it. after every run  take note of your time  your average speed  the route you took  the weather conditions and how you felt physically throughout the run. such detailed notes will help you to track how certain conditions affect your time and speed.   if you make a note that your knee has been acting up for several runs in a row  you ll know when it s time to take a rest day and you can fend off potential injuries. you will also be able to easily see from your notes when your training program is becoming repetitive and realize when it s time to mix things up and try a new running route or speed training exercise.    running fast isn t just about exercising more. you will want to make this a  whole body  experience by maintaining a proper diet  hydrating  and keeping your entire mind and body fit. a healthy diet is essential for runners  as intense  high energy workouts can take their toll on your body. it is vital that you replace the calories you burn during a workout with healthy  vitamin  and nutrient rich foods  which help you stay in peak condition and perform to the best of your ability.   you should eat plenty of animal products like chicken  lean beef  eggs and dairy products such as milk and yogurt. these foods contain high levels of protein  which is an essential energy source for runners  as well as lots of iron and zinc  which support the production of red blood cells and protect the immune system. calcium from the dairy products also promotes strong bones. you should eat whole grain cereals with added protein for breakfast. these will set you up for the day and help you feel fuller for longer. the healthy carbohydrates will also give you energy  making whole grain cereal bars a great choice for an energy boost before  during and after a run. small portions of whole grain rice and pasta  rather than their white counterparts  which are void of nutrients  are also a good mealtime accompaniment to lean meat and veggies  making dinnertime healthy  tasty and satisfying   a much sought after combination try to get five portions of fruit and veg a day. fruit and vegetables are packed with vitamins  nutrients and good carbohydrates  which help keep you full throughout the day  without piling on the calories. don t peel the fruit and veg  however  as the skins are the most nutritious part  you should also try to vary the colors of the fruit and veg you eat  as the vibrant colors of different fruits and vegetables actually result from the various  healthful  antioxidant pigments they contain. for example  tomatoes get their color from lycopene  while sweet potatoes contain the beta carotene that makes them orange     it is essential that runners stay hydrated  both during their runs and in between  as dehydration can lower the supply of oxygen to your muscles  causing you to run slower. however  contrary to popular belief  drinking eight glasses of water a day may not be the best way forward  and may even cause over hydration  which can be dangerous in extreme circumstances. to find out how much water you should be drinking a day  follow the formulas below     men  men should multiply their body weight  in pounds  by .35 fluid oz. in order to find out their optimum fluid intake per day  though runners should drink a little extra to cover fluid loss due to sweating.  women  women should multiply their body weight  in pounds  by .31 fluid oz. to get their optimum daily fluid intake  though runners should drink a little extra to cover fluid loss due to sweating. if you bring a sports bottle with you to drink water while you run  don t feel as if you need to be chugging away at it constantly. current research recommends that you should drink when you re thirsty   no more  no less.  junk food and candy may give you an instant energy boost  due to their high levels of sugar and fat  but that boost will rapidly be followed by a crash  leaving you feeling slow and sluggish. stick with natural sources of sugar and fats for the same boost  without the negative side effects.   if you re really craving something sweet  go for a banana  which is full of natural sugars but will keep you feeling full and energized for much longer than a bar of chocolate. if you re craving fats  eat a tablespoon of peanut butter  on its own or spread on some wholegrain toast.    conventional wisdom would hold that drinking coffee before running is a major no no  as coffee is a diuretic which increases the risk of dehydration. however  studies have shown that consuming a cup of coffee   or other caffeinated drinks   prior to running can actually give runners an extra burst of speed. this is great news for coffee addicts  but just remember to keep everything in moderation.    in addition to eating well  staying hydrated and training effectively  you also need to make sure that your body is getting the rest and recovery time it needs to perform well. pushing your body too hard can result in exhaustion and injury  which may put you out of the game for some time.   to prevent this from happening  make sure that you give yourself one or two rest days a week  where you don t run at all. if you like  you can perform another type of low intensity exercise such as walking or yoga on such rest days. you should also ensure that you re getting enough good quality sleep at night  as studies have shown that athletes with healthy and consistent sleeping patterns tend to have quicker reaction times and faster race finishes.    stretches are a great way to increase flexibility  improve performance and reduce the risk of injury while running. rather than traditional static stretches  stretch and hold   dynamic stretches  which incorporate movement  have been proven to be more beneficial for runners and other athletes alike  as they stretch your body in a more dynamic  functional way.  swing one leg out to the side as far as you can swing it  and then swing it back across your body in front of your standing leg  as far as possible. repeat this stretch ten times on each leg.    keep your back and knees straight  and walking forward  lift your legs straight out in front in an exaggerated march  and flex your toes towards you. too easy  add a skipping motion. do ten reps with each leg.    kick your own butt  you bet  while standing  walk forward  and swing your legs back and up  trying to kick yourself in the glutes. if this gets to be too easy  do it while jogging. do ten reps with each leg.    step forward using a long stride  and keeping the front knee over or just behind your toes  lower your body by dropping your back knee toward the ground. walk using that movement. maintain an upright posture throughout the stretch  and keep your abs tight for maximum benefit. once again  do ten reps on each leg.    get in a  pike  position with your butt in the air. put your right foot behind your left ankle. keeping your legs straight  press the heel of the left foot down  and then release. repeat ten times on each leg.    lift your left leg up like you re kicking a hacky sack  bending at the knee so it points out. tap the inside of your left foot with your right hand without bending forward. repeat ten times on each leg.    the plank exercise is a great way to build your endurance and strengthen both your abs and your back. to do a plank  lie face down  your hands flat on the ground at head level. lift up off the ground  on your toes  and resting on your elbows with your hands flat. your back should form a straight line from head to foot. tighten your core so your butt doesn t stick up or sag. hold for one minute  then ease back down. do 15 reps.   add a leg swing  to get more out of your planks  put your legs in motion  one at a time  lift one leg up so it s roughly parallel to the ground  swing it outward  keeping it parallel   then return to the starting position  and do the other leg.    this companionship and mild form of competition can be an excellent source of motivation to keep going. it s also an opportunity to test each other.    for example  if you say you are too tired or bored  have your buddy counter your excuses. in turn  encourage your running partner. make a pact to do everything to motivate each other.    try exercising every day as a daily routine    just in case your friend or family member doesn t want to run with you  see if you can convince this person to at least come with you with a bike. it can be a good way to get exercise for both of you without your pal having to get totally worn out.

makes the most of your assets. it could be a conservative suit that leaves a lot to the imagination  or a sexy summer dress. here are some things you should keep in mind as you search for the perfect outfit    pick something that you can easily take off. don t pick something with a thousand unwieldy buttons that will take an hour to remove  or something that s so tight that you need a forklift to remove it from your cleavage. pick something that s sexy  but not so provocative that you leave nothing to the imagination.    your undergarments need to be just as sexy as your actual outfit. pick a bra that makes your cleavage stand out  and tight black underwear or a thong. consider underwear that s lacy or slightly see through.   stockings with garters are a must for a striptease. you can go for classic fishnets  garters with a sexy pattern  or even garters with a racy seam up the back.    choosing a pair of shoes should be simple. the higher and thinner the heel  the better your calves and legs will look. black shoes work best for a strip tease. just make sure that the shoes are something that you can actually walk in. if you bought a new pair for the occasion  break them in a bit first.    your face and hair should look just as sexy as the rest of your outfit. let your hair hang down your back  or pull it in a loose bun that you can unravel during the striptease. your hair should look slightly messy and sexy  but still clean enough for any man to want to run his hands through it.    wear dark shadow that brings out your eyes  black mascara  and a dark red lipstick or lip gloss that makes your lips look luscious and kissable. you don t have to go overboard on the makeup  but you should wear more than you do naturally    stripteases are not an everyday affair.    now that you have your sexy outfit and look  turn down the lights by leaving most of them off  throwing a light scarf over your lamps  or just by lighting a few candles.    whoever heard of a striptease without a chair  pick a chair with a back and one that you can comfortably plant a foot on.    if you want to kick your routine up a notch  turn on some sexy r b  or whatever music gets you in the mood. pick something that won t be too slow or too fast    your striptease will have to keep the pace of the music. if you re playing music  make sure you have enough so that you don t run out of tunes just as you reach the crescendo of your strip tease.    as you get ready to show off your stuff  you have to remove all inhibitions. visualize your sexiest self and prepare to get to work. if

judging     walk toward your partner by strutting like you re on a cat walk  moving one foot in front of the other with confidence. hold your head high and keep your shoulders back  letting your chest be front and center. keep one hand on your hip.   you can even stop to gyrate your body over the side of a wall before you move toward the center of the stage.    this is not the time to be coy. maintain eye contact whenever you re facing your partner  and don t blush and look away. keep your lips slightly parted  so they look even more sultry. and whatever you do    don t laugh. no matter how silly or out of your comfort zone you feel  nothing will kill the mood faster.   however  you can give just the hint of a sexy smile whenever you re about to do something hot  like remove another article of clothing or caress your breasts.    turn away from the person and take off your top or dress as you continue to move your body. then  turn around while holding the garment and making intense eye contact with the audience. take the garment and gently throw it in your man s direction.   if you re wearing a dress  then skip the next step  but if you just took off a top  then move on to the next stage.    first  gyrate a bit  by moving your hips up and down  and moving your hands up and down the sides of your body  caressing your hips and stomach. then  turn around  bend slightly forward  hook your thumbs into your skirt  and bend with your backside toward your partner as you roll down your skirt.   let your skirt fall to the ground and kick it aside.    move around some more  walking around both sides of the chair  pressing yourself up against the back  and continuing to move up and down while caressing your body. toss your hair back  lick your lips  and maintain your sultry expression. look up at the ceiling as you caress your breasts  and show what a great time you re having.    lightly kick off your heels while placing one foot on the chair  showing off your gorgeous legs. make sure to keep your heels nearby    you ll need them again soon. stroke your leg with your hands. then  slowly roll down the stocking and toss it to your partner or to the crowd.

chair if you need help  as long as you continue to look sexy. the striptease will be sexier if you stick to the heels.    unclasp the bra until it s just covering your breasts  and hold it there. turn around to show off your bare back  and lower the bra and toss it to the side. first  cover your breasts with your hands  gyrate  and continue to caress them. then  slowly move your hands off your breasts  and turn around so you don t show too much at once.   turn back to face the person  and let them see your sexy body.    turn around and pull down your underwear  taking care to leave your shoes on. when you turn to the front  first  cover yourself with your hands  and then move them away from your private parts to caress the rest of your body. let everyone see how sexy you are  when you move around wearing only high heels.    lick your lips and kick your heels across the room until you re completely nude. and then  prepare for whatever s next    lots of tips from the crowd  or a

query	38	knowing find the name of a song   if you re looking to become famous on the internet  and keep it a secret from your parents  you ll need to build an online persona. try to create a persona that feels  real.  make sure that it s fun and involved with what you want to talk about  but will also protect your identity.how easy this will be depends on the type of content you want to make.   if you want to write a blog  for example  you can easily do this with a pen name. be careful not to write about or refer to people you know  or you could reveal your identity. if you want to vlog  it ll a bit harder to hide your identity. you could disguise your voice  and not put your face on camera. understand that linking an online persona to your normal social media accounts will instantly give you away.    you might find it easier to gain online fame if you focus your efforts in a particular niche area. if you have specialist knowledge or interests  and there s a thriving online community for them  you could concentrate on that.for example  if you re interested in fan fiction and like to write  you could promote your work on relevant forums and websites.   don t try to talk about something you think might be popular  but you are not particularly interested in or knowledgeable about. you ll be more convincing and interesting if you re talking about something you re passionate about.  however and wherever you choose to promote yourself  you should try to keep your persona consistent everywhere online. this kind of brand consistency will help you to create a strong identity that is recognisable and familiar.this could include    using the same name across all your accounts. using the same font or logo for your chosen name. concentrating your content on a specific theme.  an important part of building a strong online presence  is using lots of different online platforms to get your message across. think about how you can connect together all the many strands of online communication. here it is important that you have a consistent name and identity.for example  if you upload a new video to youtube  send a tweet with a link to promote it. different people will prefer different platforms  so only using some is limiting your potential audience. if you re trying to get famous online without your parents knowing  you should think carefully about how you use social media. your parents might not follow you on twitter  or be on facebook  but some of their friends might.    overnight sensations and viral videos are very rare. if you want to build a fan base online  you need to be prepared to be patient and persistent. keep producing new content and see how much attention it gets. try to aim for steady growth in followers and subscriptions  rather than one giant leap.avoid the temptation to start posting things you think might attract immediate followers. instead  be thoughtful and purposeful in what you say and do.if you grow your followers slowly it ll be easier to manage your profile and interact with your fans. gaining fans slowly can mean that the fans are more interested and more loyal. fans that stick with you for the longer term are likely to be the ones with a stronger interest in your content. for example  if you post lots of pictures of your knitting  your most loyal followers are likely to be fellow knitting enthusiasts.    interaction is great for building and maintaining a strong presence and online community. social media gives people the opportunity to immediately talk to people from all over the world  so try to speak directly to your fans.   retweet and reply to comments from some followers to demonstrate that you are in a conversation with them. ask questions that engage your followers while also promoting yourself. for example  you could ask  what did you have for lunch today   and post a picture of your lunch. don t retweet every response  but take the time to engage with your audience.  exposing yourself to a lot of attention on the internet can lead to problems  so be aware of the risks before you get going. even if you re trying to use an online profile or avatar that obscures your true identity  you should still be sure never to post any personal information.   don t post your address  phone number  or anything like a social security number.this might seem obvious  but make sure you don t get flattered by a lot of attention and let your guard down.    if you are trying to get famous online  you might be tempted to say or write some things that you think will get you attention and maybe lead to fame. whatever precautions you take to protect your identity and personal information  bear in mind that it s perhaps impossible to be truly anonymous online.   don t say something online that you wouldn t say in face to face communications.don t send photos of yourself to someone.make sure you use all the privacy settings on social media  and don t respond to anybody who asks for personal information.    the more attention and followers you have online  the greater the chance that unpleasant people will send you mean and insulting messages. this is an unhappy fact of online communication  so you should be aware that you might receive abusive messages from people. don t respond to any abusive messages  and delete them.   if you are a victim of cyberbullying  it is often better to try to ignore the messages. bullies are often looking for a reaction.not everyone on the internet is who they claim to be. be wary and cautious about who you interact with. if someone is sending you a lot of messages and making you uncomfortable  talk to your parents about it.

How much is a green card?  the immigration application process is complex  and many of the forms can be confusing. an experienced immigration attorney in the u.s. can facilitate the process for you and make sure all documents are correctly filled out and filed.   look for an attorney who is a member of the american immigration lawyers  association  a professional organization for experienced attorneys who specialize in immigration law.you also should make sure you check the record of any attorney you re considering hiring with the state bar association in the state where he or she is licensed.make sure the attorney is reputable and has no significant complaints or disciplinary records. you should be able to have a free consultation with several attorneys so you can find out what they can do for you and observe their demeanor and the way they treat their clients. all immigration cases are different  so you also should make sure the lawyer has experience handling your type of application.for example  if you plan to immigrate to the u.s. because you have a job offer  you probably don t want to use an attorney who specializes in fianc  immigration applications. if you re concerned about your ability to afford an attorney  you may be able to find free or reduced cost representation through a nonprofit immigration organization or other legal aid society. the immigration advocates network has a nationwide list of these organizations available at http   www.immigrationlawhelp.org.    typically your sponsor will be a u.s. citizen who is your spouse  parent  child  or sibling.lawful permanent residents also can serve as sponsors for their spouses or unmarried children.your sponsor also may be your employer  if you are applying for immigration because you have a job in the u.s. all sponsors must be over the age of 18 and live in the u.s. or in any of the u.s. territories or possessions  either as a citizen  a u.s. national  or a lawful permanent resident.  relative sponsors must complete form i 130  while employer sponsors must complete form i 140.your sponsor can download form i 130 and instructions from the u.s. citizenship and immigration services website at http   www.uscis.gov i 130. employer sponsors can download form i 140 and instructions from the uscis website at http   www.uscis.gov i 140.    your sponsor must file the petition on your behalf at the appropriate uscis processing location by mailing it using the u.s. postal service.   the uscis has two lockbox facilities for filing form i 130. whether your sponsor must file the petition at the phoenix location or the chicago location depends on the state in which he or she lives.form i 130 must be accompanied by a  420 filing fee.where your sponsor files form i 140 depends on whether he or she is filing the form by itself  or with other forms.form i 140 must be accompanied by a  580 filing fee.  it may take up to 30 days for the uscis to process your petition and send your notice of approval.once your petition is approved  it will be sent to the department of state s national visa center.even if the uscis approves your visa petition  it may take several months or even years before you get a visa number and the nvc begins processing your application. this is because u.s. law limits the number of immigrant visas available each year depending on your immigrant category and your country of citizenship.for example  if your sponsor is your spouse  parent  or adult child  it should take a minimal amount of time to proceed to the next step because immigrant visas are not limited in these categories.this is because u.s. immigration policy prioritizes family unification.if your application falls into any other category  you must check your priority date to find out how long you will have to wait for your visa. the nvc has a priority date checker available on its website.after your petition is approved  you will receive a welcome letter from the nvc that includes your nvc case number  beneficiary id number  and invoice id number. keep this information in a safe place  because you will need these numbers to complete the application process.  your agent is the person who receives information and notices from the nvc regarding your immigration application.you may act as your own agent. however  you may want to choose your petitioner sponsor  another family member  or your attorney.regardless of who you choose to act as your agent  you must complete a ds 261 form to let the uscis and the nvc know of your choice   even if you plan to act as your own agent.this form is available at the department of state s consular electronic application center  ceac   which you can access at https   ceac.state.gov iv login.aspx by entering your case number. once you ve submitted form ds 261  it may take as many as 15 days for the nvc to process it and add the information to your case file.  after you choose your agent  you must pay the processing fees for your immigrant visa application and your affidavit of support.the total amount you must pay will be listed on the invoice you received with your nvc welcome letter. that amount varies depending on your immigrant category and other factors. for example  you must pay  325 to process an i 130 petition and  120 for an affidavit of support review.the quickest way to pay your fees is online  however  you must have a checking or savings account at a u.s. bank to pay online. to make a payment  you must enter the routing number and account number for that account.if you have access to a u.s. bank

confrontation involved the european axis powers  mainly germany and italy  against the soviet union and other allied powers.the eastern front was where the majority of concentration camps were located and  thus  played a major role in the holocaust. the major battles fought on the eastern front include stalingrad and the battles that led to the recapture of kharkov by the soviets.    the western front was the site of many conflicts between germany and other western european countries like denmark  norway  luxembourg  belgium  france  the united kingdom  and the netherlands.the first phase of the war in the western front involved many of these western countries fighting germany in attempts that culminated with the battle of britain. the second phase saw a lot of ground combat between the two sides that began with the landing in normandy and lasted until the german defeat in 1945. the major battles fought on the western front include the normandy d day landing  the battle of the bulge  the battle of britain  and the battle of arnhem.  after the japanese attack on american s military bases at pearl harbor  the us launched a counterstrike against the japanese who had overextended their military forces  resulting in massive air battles that usually resulted in greater losses for the japanese than for the american allies.the major battles fought in the pacific theater included pearl harbor  the battle of midway  and the battle of the philippine sea.    the major players in world war ii included the axis and the allied powers. these were the entities between which most of the major battles took place.the axis powers included germany  italy  japan   and less significantly  bulgaria  hungary  romania  thailand  finland  and iraq. the allied powers included britain  china  france  the soviet union  the united states   and less significantly  australia  belgium  brazil  canada  cuba  czechoslovakia  greece  luxembourg  mexico  the netherlands  new zealand  norway  poland  south africa  and yugoslavia.    books can be the most important source for gathering information. primary sources are books that are written by someone with firsthand experience about the topic. so  in this case  primary sources about wwii would be written by people who actually participated in the war in some way  mostly memoirs and autobiographies .keep in mind  though  the relative bias of sources because you re usually just getting one person s point of view. some notable primary sources include    memoirs of the eastern front   a writer at war by vasily grossman   memoirs of the western front   the second world war by winston churchill  to hell and back by audie murphy  america s most decorated wwii soldier    memoirs of the pacific theater   goodbye  darkness by william manchester  isles of the damned by r.v. burgin      secondary sources are written by people who don t have firsthand knowledge of the event  but who have done extensive research on the topic. be aware these are interpretations by people who were not necessarily there. some notable secondary sources include    eastern front   berlin by anthony beevor  stalingrad by anthony beevor   western front   armageddon by max hastings  overlord by max hastings   global   the meaning of the second world war by ernest mandel  the origins of the second world war by a.j.p. taylor      many public libraries contain books and encyclopedia articles that can give you a broad overview of world war ii or more specific information about individual events or aspects of the war.. there is a vast array of information available in a public library. you might even stumble upon something you didn t know you were looking for.    watching films about wwii can be a great way to learn about what happened during this time in history. just be careful to watch movies that are historically accurate and not simply sensationalizing the past for entertainment value.   remember that few films are primary sources except for propaganda films.    the eastern front was one of the most volatile areas of the entire wwii conflict. nearly half of all of the casualties from the war took place on the eastern front.some examples of historically accurate films about the eastern front include     cross of iron  1977   stalingrad  1993   enemy at the gates  2001   stalingrad   downfall  2004   berlin   defiance  2008   valkyrie  2008     the western front consisted mostly of air warfare between germany and britain as well as the infamous d day landing in normandy.some examples of historically accurate films about the western front include     das boot  1981   saving private ryan  1998   the longest day  1962   invasion of normandy   a bridge too far  1977   operation market garden   band of brothers  2001 . this is a mini series produced by steven spielberg and tom hanks that is based on stephen e. ambrose s book of the same name. the series follows easy company  a company of paratroopers in the 101st airborne division  506 parachute infantry regiment  from their training in fort bragg to the occupation of germany  covering scenes such as operation overlord  commonly known as d day   operation market garden  the battle of the bulge  and easy company capturing hitler s eagle nest.    the pacific theater mainly involved the conflict between japan and the united states during world war ii. this includes the attack on pearl harbor  the battle of iwo jima  and many other crucial events in the war.some historically accurate films to watch about conflict in the pacific include     the thin red line  guadalcanal   flags of our fathers  2006   iwo jima   letters from iwo jima  2006   the pacific  2010 . like band of brothers  this is a miniseries produced by tom hanks and steven spielberg. unlike band of brothers  it details the stories of soldiers of the 1st marine division at guadalcanal  cape gloucester  peleliu  iwo jima  and okinawa and is based on three separate books. it is also an extremely accurate depiction of world war ii.    talk to a veteran and get their perspective on the war. having a conversation with a veteran could be one of the best ways for you to get information about wwii because you can get actual firsthand recollections from someone who experienced it.if you have trouble finding a veteran to talk to  you might try attending your community s veteran s day parade. they often participate in such events. you can also ask older relatives what their experiences were like. while not everyone went to war  those who stayed home can give you insight into what the world was like at that time. and many of them contributed to the war effort at home.    many of the bigger museums pertaining to world war ii are in europe  but there are also quite a few in the united states. no matter which one you go to  there will be plenty of accurate information for you to learn about world war ii. here are some museums you might want to visit    the national wwii museum of new orleansthe museum of world war ii in bostonthe wright museum of world war ii in wolfeboro  new hampshirethe wwii japanese american internment museum in mcgehee  arkansasthe imperial war museum in londonthe d day museum in portsmouth  englandthe hiroshima peace memorial museum in hiroshima  japanthe bergen belsen memorial in germany  many colleges give courses in the history department that focus exclusively on world war ii. look at the class catalogue for your college  or one in your area  and see if they offer something similar.this is a great way to learn about wwii  especially if you are not a very good self motivator. if you take a course  you ll have teacher imposed deadlines to complete your learning.    this is probably a step few will accomplish  but this is the best way to get a feel for what the war was like for the soldiers. visiting the actual location of the d day invasion will help you visualize what happened on that day in history.   there are also monuments  cemeteries  and memorials for you to visit near d day site in normandy.  one of the best ways to fully understand the truly devastating implications of world war ii is to visit the site of a former concentration camp. it will be a powerful and moving experience to visit the actual sites of such tragic events. these sites also contain memorials and museums with plenty of information about the events that took place during the war.try visiting auschwitz birkenau  sachsenhausen  or buchenwald.

first step is to find out which regions have suffered floods and need help.   depending on where the flood occurred  different humanitarian organizations will be involved in coordinating relief efforts. if the flood occurred in the united states  chances are the american red cross and salvation army will be marshalling aid and leading relief efforts. if it is an international natural disaster  check to see if unicef or americares are providing aid in the affected area. visit the organization s website or call to find out what kind of aid they are providing and how you can best get involved.    as the needs change  so will the ways you can help    some ways might be more inline with your abilities or resources over others.   different needs will arise at different moments in the crisis. for instance  there will be emergent needs in the immediate aftermath as well as long term rebuilding needs for years to come. sometimes an organization will reach maximum capacity with certain types of donations  like clothing   but have a deficit in another area. the best way to know what is most needed is to frequently check in with the status of their aid efforts and need by calling or looking for updates on their social media accounts.    there are several ways to get involved  and each has their own pros and cons as detailed below in and in the following sections.   if you have extra funds or goods  you might consider making monetary donations. if you have time  skills  or other supportive resources to offer in lieu of monetary donations  you can offer these to those in need. there are pros cons for each this type of involvement  for donations  a pro is that you can act quickly and put resources in the hands of organizations who can decide how to best help the victims. a con to making donations is that you don t necessarily know if all of your money will go directly to the victims  be sure to research how organizations administer donations before you give to them . one of the biggest pros of volunteering instead of donating money is that you get to feel like you really providing hands on helps while interacting with people. a potential con is the danger and risk of injury associated with traveling to flood zones.    sending money is an easy and effective way to help.   be sure that you are donating to a reputable organization like the salvation army  american red cross  or unicef. unfortunately  some sham organizations can crop up in the aftermath of disasters as ploys to steal well intentioned donations.ask if you can make a donation via text message. a recent trend among aid organizations is to provide a phone number and keyword for people to make a donations. the amount you give will show up on your next mobile phone bill. it s as easy as sending a text message  and much more meaningful   if you have extra or unneeded items laying around  consider donating them to flood victims in need.gently used clothing  socks  shoes  bedding  and blankets are almost always in need after a devastating flood. you can also help the children affected by floods by sending them books and toys. purchase and donate new  non perishable food items and bottled drinking water. first aid kits  tents  mosquito netting  soap  and hygiene products might also be needed.    floods can cause serious injuries and there may be a need for more blood after a the disaster. if there s a blood drive in your area  and if you meet the health age requirements  consider becoming a donor.  some large companies  especially governmental agencies or offices  allow people to donate their unused sick time or vacation leave to others in need. contact the human resources representative at your work and ask if you can transfer some of your leave time to those unable to work as a result of the flood.  if it s safe enough to travel to the afflicted area  see if aid organizations are looking for volunteers to help on the ground.   if you meet height  weight  age  fitness  education  and u.s. citizenship requirements  consider joining the national guard. the national guard is a part time  locally organized branch of the u.s. military that responds to natural disasters  both in the u.s. and sometimes abroad  as part of their call of duty.after completing basic training  you can chose a short term enlistment  three years  and then continue to be a member of the individual ready reserve  irr  who are called up in the event of emergencies like natural disasters.consider volunteering with habitat for humanities or other organizations whose mission is to clear debris  help homeowners salvage their personal belongings  and rebuild damaged homes.   your time and talents are a valuable resource and can help those in need.if you are a health care professional  see if you can donate your medical services or supplies. if you are a contractor or work in construction  volunteer your manpower  supplies  and other resources towards rebuilding efforts. if you are an educator or child care worker  offer to provide support and assistance with displaced families and their children. if you are a business owner  especially in the area surrounding the flood  offer discounts or gratis goods services to those affected by the flood.    even if you can t be there on the ground  you can still make a big difference by volunteering.   get in touch with the local branch of the aid organization working with flood victims and see if they need help in their call center  hotline  or donation processing facility. you can also become a community liaison by collecting local donations and bringing them to the regional sorting facility.    if you live nearby the flood area and your house is intact  consider fostering a displaced family who may have lost their home and everything they own in the disaster.  many people rely on their faith during times of crisis and draw emotional and spiritual strength from the support of church and religion.   if you are part of a church or religious organization  encourage your leaders to reach out to flood victims with support as well as tangible aid. some large religious organization  like the billy graham rapid response team  send crisis trained chaplains into areas impacted by natural disasters to coordinate relief efforts and provide further emotional and spiritual support for those affected.if you are a spiritual person  pray for the flood victims and or reflect for a moment on the situation. open your heart to ways you can help  and be a comfort to those in need.  in additional to other forms of help  you can make some basic  caring gestures towards those in need.ask how you can be most helpful to those affected by the flood. they might need a hot  home cooked meal  help taking care of their pets  or photographing flood damage for insurance claims. be a good listener and remember that sometimes its best to just listen and not offer your own opinions or solutions without being asked for them. remember that people need support in the days  months  and even years following natural disasters. be sensitive to the fact that new issues and difficulties can continue to arise  even after the flood waters subside.

How do you form a sentence? What are 4 types of sentence structure? How do you identify a phrase in English?  every word in the english language can be categorized as a specific part of speech. the parts of speech do not define what a word is. instead  they describe how to use that word.   a noun is a person  place  or thing.example  grandma  school  pencil a pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun within a sentence. example  he  she  they  articles are special terms that proceed a noun within a sentence. the three articles are  a  an  the an adjective modifies or describes a noun or pronoun. example  red  tall a verb is a word that describes an action or state of being. example  be  run  sleep an adverb modifies or describes a verb. adverbs can also be used to modify adjectives. example  happily  wonderfully a conjunction joins two parts of a sentence together. example  and  but a preposition is used in combination with a noun or pronoun to create a phrase that modifies other parts of speech  like a verb  noun  pronoun  or adjective. example  up  down  of  from  interjections are words that express an emotional state. example  wow  ouch  hey    most parts of speech have additional rules governing their usage. if you want to master english grammar  you will need to study these rules in detail. make note of the following for your studies nouns can be  singular or plural  proper or common  collective  count or non count  abstract or concrete  gerunds pronouns can be  personal  possessive  reflexive  intensive  reciprocal  indefinite  demonstrative  interrogative  or relative adjectives can be used on their own  for the sake of making comparisons  or as superlatives. adverbs are either relative adverbs or adverbs of frequency. conjunctions are either coordinating or correlative. verbs can be  action verbs or linking verbs  main verbs or auxiliary helping verbs the articles  a  and  an  are indefinite  while the article  the  is definite.    single digit numbers  zero through nine  should be spelled out in word form  but double digit numbers  10 and up  should be written in numerical form.all numbers within a sentence should either be spelled out or written numerically. do not mix and match.  correct example  i bought 14 apples but my sister only bought 2 apples. incorrect example  i bought 14 apples but my sister only bought two apples.   never start a sentence with a number written in numerical form. spell out simple fractions and use hyphens with them. example  one half a mixed fraction can be written numerically. example  5 1 2 write decimals in numerical figures. example  0.92 use commas when writing numbers with four or more digits. example  1 234 567 write out the numerical figure when specifying the day of the month. example  june 1    at minimum  every sentence consists of a subject and an action. a sentence that lacks either one is a sentence fragment and is considered to be improper.   the subject is usually a noun or pronoun  and the action is conveyed using a verb. correct example  the dog ran.  note that the subject is indicated in italics and the action is indicated in bold print.   incorrect example  yesterday afternoon. expand your sentences into more complex forms after mastering this basic format.    within a sentence  both the subject and verb must share the same singular plural state. you cannot use the singular form of a verb with a plural subject  a plural subject must have a plural verb.correct example  they are at school. incorrect example  they is at school. when two singular subjects are connected with the word  and   he and his brother   the subject becomes plural. when connected by  or  or  nor   he or his brother   the subject is singular. collective nouns  like  family  or  team   are treated as singular nouns and require a singular verb.    compound sentences are the easiest sentence form to master after the basic sentence. use a conjunction to join two related thoughts into one sentence rather than forming two separate sentences.   instead of  the dog ran. he was fast.  use  the dog ran and he was fast.   instead of  we looked for the missing book. we could not find it.  use  we looked for the missing book but could not find it.      a conditional sentence describes a situation in which one part of the sentence is true only if the other part is true. they can also be referred to as  if  then  statements  but the word  then  will not always appear when the sentence is written.example  if you ask your mother  then she will take you to the store.  note  however  that it would also be correct to write  if you ask your mother  she will take you to the store. both forms are still conditional.      use clauses to form complex sentences. clauses are the  building blocks  that can be used to expand a sentence past its basic form. they can either be independent or dependent.an independent clause has its own subject and verb. as a result  it could stand as its own sentence. note that compound sentences  as mentioned previously  consist of independent clauses.  example  she felt sad  but her friends cheered her up.  both  she felt sad  and  her friends cheered her up  could stand as separate sentences.   a dependent clause is one that could not stand as its own sentence.  example  while he agreed with his brother  the boy would not admit to it.  the clause  while he agreed with his brother  would not make sense a separate sentence  so it is a dependent clause.      there are multiple punctuation marks and various rules governing their usage. you should study these rules in detail  but first  you need a basic understanding of how each punctuation mark is used.periods  .  mark the end of a statement sentence.  ellipses  ...  indicate that a portion of text has been removed from the passage.  commas     separate words or word groups when a pause is necessary but a period is inappropriate.  semicolons     should be used in complex sentences that lack a connecting conjunction.  colons     are used to introduce lists within a sentence.  question marks     are used at the end of a sentence when the sentence asks a question.  exclamation points     are used at the end of a statement sentence to indicate surprise or emphasis.  quotation marks     separate words spoken by another person from the rest of the text.  parentheses    enclose information that clarifies a preceding thought.  apostrophes     separate contractions and show possession.    a basic paragraph consists of three to seven sentences. each paragraph must have a topic sentence  supporting sentences  and a concluding sentence.the topic sentence is usually the first sentence in the paragraph. it is the most general sentence and introduces the idea you plan to discuss throughout the rest of the paragraph.  example  english grammar is a complex topic that covers a range of information.    the supporting sentences explain the idea presented in the topic sentence with greater detail.  example  english grammar is a complex topic that covers a range of information. at the  word  level  one must learn about parts of speech. at the  sentence  level  topics like sentence structure  subject verb agreement  and clauses must be explored. the rules governing punctuation use are also a part of  sentence  level grammar. once a person starts writing larger piece  he or she must also learn about paragraph structure and organization.    the concluding sentence summarizes the information presented in the paragraph. it is not always necessary  but you should still know how to write one.  example  english grammar is a complex topic that covers a range of information. at the  word  level  one must learn about parts of speech. at the  sentence  level  topics like sentence structure  subject verb agreement  and clauses must be explored. the rules governing punctuation use are also a part of  sentence  level grammar. once a person starts writing larger piece  he or she must also learn about paragraph structure and organization. all of these rules define and describe how to write english correctly.    also note that the first sentence of a paragraph should be indented a few spaces to the right of the paragraph s left edge.    while you could technically have a paragraph that uses nothing but basic sentences  a better and more grammatically pleasing paragraph will have a variety of

feel comfortable with your paragraph writing skills  try writing longer works  like academic essays. essay writing is a separate subject  so you should study about it in greater detail. there are a few things you should keep in mind as you begin  though.    organize your essay by writing an introductory paragraph  three or more body paragraphs  and a concluding paragraph. the introductory paragraph must be a general paragraph that presents the main idea without providing detail. the supporting paragraphs must expand on this main idea with greater detail  and each paragraph should cover its own separate point. the concluding paragraph restates and summarizes the information presented in the essay and does not introduce any new information.    the rules and information provided in this article will not teach you everything you need to know about english grammar. this article is intended to serve as a starting point in your studies. the actual subject of english grammar is much more complex  and you will need to devote a lot of time and effort if you really want to learn it.    some aspects will be similar while others will differ.   when the rules are the same  rely on the knowledge you have of your native grammar to help you with english grammar. when the rules differ  devote more time and concentration on practicing those aspects of english grammar as you study.    people who do a lot of reading tend to be more proficient with english grammar in their own writing and speech.   this does not refer to grammar books. grammar books are helpful  of course  but the principle of this step is a different one. read books  magazines  or other materials written in english that you enjoy. the more often you read  the more familiar you will naturally become with the way that grammar is used in word  sentence  and paragraph levels. learning the rules of english grammar is an important step  but you will be able to put those rules into practice better if you are actually used to seeing proper grammar.    if you are no longer in school  consider taking a grammar class at a community college  community center  or library. you could also look for a class online.   for non native english speakers  look for classes specifically designed for students who are learning english as a secondary language. these classes are usually labeled as esl  english as a second language   enl  english as a new language   or esol  english for speakers of other languages  classes.    if formal classes do not help  find a mentor who can review grammar rules with you one on one. this mentor could be a teacher  professor  or professional tutor. on the other hand  it could also be a parent  sibling  friend  or other relative who has a strong grasp of the english language and is willing to help out.    go to a bookstore and purchase an english grammar workbook  or hop online and access some free grammar resources through the internet.   as a general rule  look for internet sources that come from educational  .edu  websites. examples include   the guide to grammar and writing by capital community college foundation  http   grammar.ccc.commnet.edu grammar   purdue university s online writing lab  https   owl.english.purdue.edu owl section 1 5        above all else  practice makes perfect. the more you can practice english grammar  the better you ll get with it.

How are you supposed to feel after acupuncture? What are the negative effects of acupuncture? How are you supposed to feel after acupuncture? What does acupuncture actually do?  acupuncture has been used for thousands of years in china and asia.however  it doesn t follow a western european method of disease diagnosis and treatment  so it is useful to consider this as an alternative method to rectify your condition.   read about it in books or magazines. talk to an acupuncture practitioner  or to someone who has successfully used it. read information on suitable websites  such as government health departments or traditional chinese medicine schools with a good reputation.    if you are extremely adverse to trying it  no one can or should convince you to do so. however  if you are convinced it might work for you  or you re feeling desperate for another treatment route  acupuncture might be extremely helpful and be exactly what you need. acupuncture can relieve pain  reduce symptoms  or help restore balance to your body s system. only you can decide if it is worth giving it a try.   be wary of anyone who claims it can cure anything more substantial  however  as it doesn t cure cancer and cannot save you from an incurable illness.    if you have decided to try acupuncture  see if it is covered by your insurance plan or your health system s welfare coverage.   your doctor might have to refer you for treatment to get it covered. discuss this idea with your doctor first if you d like. if it s not covered  decide if you can afford to pay out of pocket for it on your own. in case money is an issue search for a local  community style  acupuncturist who treats people in a group setting which cuts costs down on the cost of treatment.    depending on where you live  you might easily find a qualified acupuncture doctor  or you may not. the nih  however  has found that acupuncture is being widely practiced by physicians  dentists  acupuncturists  and other practitioners.you will need to check if acupuncture is regulated where you live  a state  province  or region may or may not certify such doctors  making it harder for you to know whether or not your acupuncturist is reputable.   if you are having difficulties finding out  inquire in a local oriental medicine clinic or college for more information. if you know of people who have had successful treatments  ask for their recommendation. always ask to see their credentials and state license.  acupuncture is a system in which you receive a series of up to 20 treatments of up to an hour each  or more   spread out over several weeks. there will usually be a day or two between each treatment or possibly a week depending on your condition. acupuncture focuses on treating overall well being and not just the symptoms  taking a holistic approach. this means you must set aside time because it is useless to take only one treatment  or to begin a series and not finish it. not finishing a course of treatment is a waste of money.    go to the acupuncturist and tell him her your problem. show your acupuncturist where your pain is  explain your symptoms  tell him her what you ve tried before  what you eat  how you sleep. be open to the acupuncturist s explanation and suggestions. expect the explanation to be different from what a western doctor may say.    tell the acupuncturist if this is your first time. he she will probably explain what is going on in more detail for a new patient. normally  you will lie on a regular examination or massage bed  and remove clothes from the areas the acupuncturist tells you to. you will be draped in a sheet or towel  plus a blanket if it s cold. be sure to wear loose clothing when you go for your appointment.   the acupuncturist will unwrap brand new never used sterile needles from plastic packets. they might also swab the insertion areas with alcohol  this is required for qualified acupuncturists in the usa . you might not see where they will be inserted.    close your eyes and let your muscles loosen. this is a time to focus your energy inward toward healing. focus on the fact that you have pain or something wrong  and you want to get better. let this happen.   you will feel a small prick when the needle is inserted. after that first instant  you should feel nothing. if you feel a sudden sharp nerve pain  alert the acupuncturist to let him or her know. he she might need to remove the needle and insert it in a slightly different place. the acupuncturist may insert up to 20 different needles at various points  though the first treatment may have fewer. lie still. close your eyes. relax. visualize the areas of pain or problems  and how they must improve. you should soon feel absolutely nothing. rest. take a little nap. meditate. pain is subjective  and many people report no or minimal pain from acupuncture.if there is undue pain  alert the practitioner immediately as it may be the result of improper placement of the needles  a defective needle  or your own movement causing a slip.    this could be anywhere from 20 60 minutes  less at first. don t plan to read  though you could listen to quiet music. it s best to simply snooze or meditate.    you have decided to receive acupuncture. now you must relax  not argue  or stress. otherwise it won t work as well. go with it. if you decide later not to return  that s your choice. during the treatment  simply lie there. it won t hurt after the first moment.    bruising is normal if you had needles inserted into you.

When should an Apgar assessment be completed on a newborn?  even though apgar refers to the designer s name  it can also be used as an acronym   apgar  can stand for appearance  skin color   pulse  grimace response  reflexes   activity  muscle tone   and respiration. this test is used to measure the overall well being of the baby by looking at the major indicators of wellness.  the first category is appearance. in this part of the test  the medical staff will look at the baby s skin color. the skin color can indicate whether the baby is receiving enough oxygen or not.a zero in this category means the baby is blue all over. a one means the baby is mostly a healthy color but may be bluish at the hands and feet. a two means the baby is a healthy color all over  including pink at the hands and feet.    the next category on the apgar test is heart rate. a nurse  doctor  or midwife will check for the baby s heartbeat. the medical staff will also determine the pulse rate to see how the baby is thriving.if the baby doesn t have a heart rate  the score is zero. a score of one indicates a heart rate under 100 beats per minute  which is not quite as fast as it should be. a score of two indicates the baby s heart rate is over 100  which means the baby is thriving in this particular category.    the grimace response is how the baby reacts to mild stimulus. for instance  the baby may be lightly pinched to see if the baby responds a lot or if it doesn t respond at all to the stimulus.a zero indicates no response. a one means the baby pulls a face  grimaces  but doesn t sneeze or cough. a two means the baby pulls a face and either cries  pulls away  sneezes  or coughs in response.    next comes a check of muscle tone. muscle tone just measures the baby s activity to see if it is moving around on its own. an active baby indicates that they are doing well.a zero indicates the baby is limp or not moving much at all. if the baby is given a one  it means they are moving with smaller or less active motions  but they are not as vigorous as the doctor would prefer. a two means the baby is actively moving around.    the last category on the apgar test is breathing. a person on the medical staff examines the baby to see how they re breathing  then assigns a number to the breathing effort from zero to two based on what they observe.a zero means the baby is not breathing  while a one means the baby has irregular breathing. a two means is the baby is breathing just fine  which usually means the baby is both breathing and crying with normal effort and at a normal rate.    the score from the apgar is generally taken as a whole rather than in individual categories. in other words  all the scores from each category are added together to get one number. the best possible score is ten  which means the baby is doing as well as they can be. however  most babies don t score a ten at birth.a score from seven to ten means the baby will just need standard care. if the score is under seven  the baby will need more monitoring and possibly interventions  such as help breathing.  while a low score may seem scary  it usually doesn t mean the baby will have long term health effect. rather  it just means the baby needs a little extra care right after birth to help stabilize their health.certain factors can cause the apgar score to be lower. often  it s caused by a c section  premature birth  or a birth that s a bit more difficult than other births. a low score can also be caused by fluid in the airway.    if the baby has a low score  generally one of two things will happen. with the first intervention  the baby s airway will be cleared out if it has fluid  and the baby will be given oxygen. a second option is the baby may be given stimulation to get the heart beating more rapidly.keep in mind that if these basic interventions do not work  the medical team will do whatever is necessary to improve the baby s condition. this can vary based on the causes of the score.    generally  the baby will be placed somewhere warm while the test is performed. that can either be on a parent s belly or under a warmer. keeping the baby warm is important.  as the name implies  the one minute test is performed a minute after the baby leaves the mother s body. it tells the medical staff how well the baby did during the birthing process and accesses the baby s need for assistance.  the five minute test  as it sounds  is given five minutes after birth. this test is the same as the one minute test  but it s given to measure how the baby is doing out in the world  out of the womb .this test also helps evaluate whether any interventions are working.  while the test is usually just performed twice  it may be given a third time if the baby has a low score. usually  it s given at the ten minute mark to see if the baby has improved any from the five minute test.

How can I calm my asthma?  many people with asthma can breathe  run and exercise without trouble most of the time but certain triggers  inside or outside your body  can set off a cascade of symptoms that last from minutes to weeks. when your asthma kicks in  think about what environments you were recently exposed to and try to figure out what is setting you off. this will help you know what to avoid in the future. the most common triggers include air pollution   smog and extreme changes in the weather can irritate and greatly increase the number of asthma attacks.  exposure to an allergen   common allergens include grass  trees  pollen  certain foods  etc . note that the combination of an allergic reaction along with an asthma attack can be very dangerous and should not be taken lightly.  cold air   cold air can dry out airways and irritate the respiratory system  causing an onset of asthma  illness   a respiratory infection such as the common cold can dry out the airways and irritate the respiratory system  causing the onset of your asthma.  irritants in the air   any smoke  from tobacco to wood smoke  can trigger an asthma attack  as can fragrances in the air  like perfumes  colognes and scented aerosols.  dust and mold   your home environment can be the source of an asthma attack  particularly if mold or dust are present.  stress and strong emotions   if you are overwhelmed by stress or dealing with depression or anxiety  then you may be more susceptible to an asthma attack.physical activity   exercise can trigger an asthma attack in some people.foods that contain sulfites or other preservatives   some people also have asthma attacks after consuming foods that contain sulfites or other preservatives  such as shrimp  beer  wine  and dried fruit.    if you are having trouble figuring out what causes your asthma to flare up  keep track of your symptoms for several weeks in an asthma diary that details all the environmental  physical and emotional factors you encountered. grab your diary any time you experience a flareup and document your symptoms  how you felt  and what you did or were exposed to right before the attack.   look for a pattern. if you suspect your asthma is triggered by bodily factors like the flu  track your asthma and other illnesses over the course of a year and see if you can find a correlation. be consistent. the diary will be most useful if you fill it in as often as possible. if you tend to be absent minded  set an appointment on your phone or computer to remind you to update it if something eventful has happened. bring your diary with you to checkups with your doctor  as this can help your doctor craft a proper treatment regimen for you.    you should learn to recognize warning signs of an impending attack  such as coughing  wheezing  shortness of breath or chest tightness. it s also a good idea to regularly measure and record your peak airflow with a home peak flow meter since you may not be able to immediately register that your lung function is decreasing.a peak expiratory flow meter is a small device that measures the maximum speed of expiration in order to monitor a person s ability to exhale air. if the measurements range from 50  to 79  of your personal best  this is indicative of an asthma flareup. regularly measuring and logging your peak flow can help you determine what is normal and thus  what is abnormal for you.    if your triggers still aren t clear  your pulmonologist  allergist or general practitioner can perform tests to help you discover what sets off your asthma.   allergy testing is not a tool used for general diagnosis of asthma  but it is a useful technique for determining triggers.a number of allergic symptoms can be associated with asthma. the association of asthma with atopy is well documented . atopy is defined as having ige antibodies to particular antigens  which means you would have a genetic predisposition towards certain diseases including asthma  rhinitis  and eczema.  these are common asthma triggers  and keeping a clean environment can go a long way in preventing asthma flareups. make vacuuming and dusting part of your weekly cleaning routine to avoid triggering an asthma attack. to avoid dust mites  use mattress and pillow covers  wash bedding often and avoid quilts that use down feathers.   mold is caused by humidity  so use a hygrometer to check how humid your home environment is. use a dehumidifier to keep the environment moisture and mold free. regularly disinfect showers and other places where moisture can lead to mold growth. if you suspect there is a significant mold problem in your home or work place  get it professionally inspected and removed. get a hepa or other type of air filter for your home. you can also use fans and air conditioning to maintain good air circulation.    some people with asthma are highly sensitive to perfumes. if that s you  don t wear a lot of perfume and try to avoid being around people who wear a lot of perfume. if you must use perfume  use it lightly and try not to inhale it.   avoid using scented candles and air fresheners as well  as scented products can irritate your nasal passages and breathing airways. you can even opt for scent free laundry detergent.    studies have shown that cities with high levels of air pollution have much higher asthma rates  especially among children.smog  car exhaust and other air pollutants can all contribute to asthma.   monitor your local air quality index and avoid exercising or spending too much time outside on bad days. learn when air quality is best  such as mornings in the summer  and schedule outdoor activities for those times.filter the air in your home through your air conditioner  instead of opening windows. avoid living by the highway or a busy intersection. if you can  move to a home that has fresh  dry air.    whether from tobacco  incense  fireworks or anything else  do your best to avoid inhaling smoke. not only should you not smoke at all  but you should make an effort to avoid being in the presence of other smokers or anything that elicits smoke and can cause your asthma to flare up.   research suggests a clear link between secondhand smoke and asthma  especially in young people. nearly 26 000 new diagnoses of asthma in children and teens may be due to secondhand smoke.  when your body is focused on dealing with an illness  it has fewer resources to handle other types of diseases. thus  the combination of a cold flu with an asthma attack can be very dangerous. when your asthma is triggered by other viruses  minor sniffles can turn into weeks of wheezing and coughing. take extra precautions to avoid getting sick.   get a seasonal influenza and pneumonia vaccination. the flu isn t fun for anyone  but people with asthma especially should be sure to get a flu shot every year. consult your primary care physician for more information. flu vaccines are typically offered from september until mid november each year.avoid close contact with people who may be contagious. don t share any food or drink with people who have a cold or the flu. this increases your likelihood of getting sick. wash your hands often especially during cold and flu season. being mindful of germs and maintaining good hygiene can keep you from getting sick.    if you have allergies that hit your lungs or sinuses  getting them treated can go a long way towards getting your asthma under control as well. talk to your doctor or allergist about medications and strategies to treat your allergies.decongestants and antihistamines can be purchased over the counter treat some allergy symptoms. prescription nasal sprays and tablet medications can treat a variety of seasonal allergies. immune therapy shots can reduce your allergies over the long term by helping your immune system build a tolerance to offending allergens. if you re uncertain about whether you have allergies in the first place  talk to your doctor about a possible allergy test. this test will determine whether you demonstrate reactions to the most common allergic triggers  which can also be unknown triggers for asthma.    once you are diagnosed with asthma  create an asthma action plan with your allergist or physician. this plan is basically a step by step process of what to do when you face an acute attack. the plan should be written down and include emergency phone numbers as well as those of family and friends who can meet you at the hospital if needed.having this plan and being in control of your own treatment can make you feel more in control over the illness. you control your asthma  it doesn t control you.    if you do have asthma  there are a number of prescription drugs that can help you manage your asthma so that attacks become less frequent. there are inhalers for both daily and quick relief use. talk to your doctor about finding a medication that works for you.there are two different type of rescue medications that you may have been prescribed  a metered dose inhaler  mdi  or a dry powder inhaler  dpi . mdis the are most common inhalers. they deliver asthma medication through a small aerosol canister equipped with a chemical propellant that pushes the medication into the lungs. a dpi inhaler means of delivering dry powder asthma rescue medication without propellant. a dpi requires you to breathe in quickly and deeply  which makes them difficult to use during an asthma attack. this makes them less popular than the standard mdis. your doctor may also prescribe you a quick relief inhaler  like albuterol  which you are to use during emergencies and flareups. watch yourself carefully for increasing use of this type of medication. if you find yourself using it more and more often  it means that your asthma is not under control. seek medical advice from your doctor.take your medication as prescribed. just because your asthma seems to be improving doesn t mean that you should stop the medication. consult your physician before making any changes.    asthma treatment is broken down into intermittent  mild persistent  moderate persistent  and severe persistent disease. the main diagnostic feature between these four categories include nocturnal awakenings. the more severe and frequent the nocturnal awakenings are the more severe the asthma is categorized.intermittent asthma usually occurs during the day  with one or two episodes per week. you experience two or less nocturnal awakenings per month.  mild persistent asthma presents with symptoms more than twice a week. you may have three to four nocturnal awakenings per month.  moderate persistent asthma means you have daily symptoms  with nocturnal awakenings more than once per week.  severe persistent asthma means you experience symptoms daily and nocturnal awakenings each night. treatment for intermittent asthma includes a short acting beta agonist medication while treatment for severe disease includes a long term beta agonist medication with medium dose inhaled glucocorticoids with possible leukotriene inhibitors. pay attention to your symptoms and consult your doctor if you are having increasing nighttime awakenings and worsening daily symptoms.    make an effort to relax yourself as stress  anxiety and emotional upsets can trigger asthma and make it worse. techniques including yoga  meditation  deep breathing  and progressive muscle relaxation may help alleviate your tension and stress and in turn reduce the risk of an asthma flare up.focusing on deepening your breath is one way to invoke the relaxation response to stress. deep breathing encourages full oxygen exchange  which helps to slow the heartbeat and stabilize or even lower blood pressure. begin by finding a quiet and comfortable place to sit or lie down. take a normal breath or two to settle yourself. then try a deep breath  breathe in slowly through your nose  allowing your chest and lower belly to expand as you fill your lungs. let your abdomen expand fully. now breathe out slowly through your mouth  or your nose  if that feels more natural . try doing this for several minutes.  smoking cigarettes and similar products  even a little bit  can contribute to asthma and a variety of other severe health problems. quitting smoking isn t easy  but doing so will have a dramatic positive effect on your health.  obesity can contribute to asthma and makes it more difficult to control existing asthma with exercise. if you are overweight  get yourself on a diet and exercise plan that will get you into a healthy range. whether someone is overweight or obese is determined by using the body mass index  bmi   an indicator of body fatness. bmi is a person s weight in kilograms  kg  divided by the square of the person s height in meters  m . a bmi of 25 29.9 is considered overweight  while a bmi greater than 30 is considered obese.reduce the number of calories you intake and increase the amount of exercise you do. this is the secret to weight loss.watch portion sizes and make a concerted effort to eat slowly  savor and chew your food and stop eating when you are full. remember that you just need to feel satiated  not stuffed to the brim.    research has shown that exercise has a positive impact on asthma and should be done as tolerated. exercise can decrease the severity of asthma symptoms  although you need to be cautious to consider your asthma when planning an exercise regimen. if you have exercise triggered asthma  be careful about exercising in cold or overly dry or humid environments. activities that are better for people who suffer from exercise induced asthma  eib  include swimming  cycling  hiking and walking.yoga is a good option for asthmatics because it both increases fitness and helps you learn to regulate and become more aware of your breath.if you want to play team sports  consider those with short bursts of activity  like baseball or football   rather than sports with longer spurts of activity like soccer  long distance running or basketball.use your inhaler if you are worried your workout is going to bring on an attack. in fact  it s a good idea to always bring your inhaler with you wherever you go  just in case   and this includes the gym or outdoors.

What causes upper back pain between shoulder blades? What does a slipped disc feel like in upper back?  upper back pain is often caused by repetitive motions at work or minor injuries related to playing sports or vigorous exercise. as a first measure  take a break from the activity that may have resulted in the strain and rest for a few days. if your problem is work related  talk to your boss about switching to a different activity or improving the ergonomics of your work station. if the pain is exercise related  you may be working out too aggressively or with bad form. in this case  consult with a professional trainer or sports therapist.   total bed rest is not a good idea for any type of back pain because some movement  even just leisurely walks  is needed to stimulate blood flow and healing.practice better posture at work and at home. sit up straight and don t slouch or lean to one side excessively. examine your sleeping conditions. mattresses that are too soft or pillows that are too thick may contribute to upper back pain. avoid sleeping on your stomach as it can cause the head and neck to twist in ways that aggravate back pain.    non steroidal anti inflammatories  nsaids  such as ibuprofen  naproxen  or aspirin can be short term solutions to help you deal with pain or inflammation in your upper back. keep in mind that these medications can be hard on your stomach  kidneys  and liver  so it s best not to use them for more than two weeks at a stretch.   dosage for adults is usually 200   400 mg  by mouth  every four to six hours.alternatively  you can try over the counter analgesics such as acetaminophen  tylenol  or muscle relaxants  such as cyclobenzaprine  for your upper back pain  but never take them when you are taking nsaids. be careful not to take any medications on an empty stomach  as they can irritate the lining of your stomach and increase the risk of ulcers.    the application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all minor musculoskeletal injuries  including upper back pain. cold therapy is most effective for acute injuries  injuries that have occurred in the last 48 hours . cold therapy should be applied to the tender part of your upper back in order to reduce the swelling and pain. ice should be applied for 20 minutes every two to three hours for a couple of days  then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside.compressing the ice against your back with a wrap around elastic support will also help control the inflammation. always wrap ice or frozen gel packs in a thin towel in order to prevent frostbite on your skin.    soaking your back in a warm epsom salt bath can significantly reduce pain and swelling  especially if the pain is caused by muscle strain.the magnesium in the salt helps the muscles relax. don t make the water too hot  to prevent scalding  and don t soak in the bath for much more than 30 minutes because the salty water will pull fluid from your body and start to dehydrate you.   if swelling is a particular problem in your upper back  then follow the warm salt bath with cold therapy until your back feels numb  about 15 minutes or so .    stretching the affected area of your back might reverse the condition  especially if you address the problem during its early stages. use slow  steady movements and take deep breaths during your stretches. in general  hold stretches for about 30 seconds and repeat three to five times daily.   kneel on a padded surface with your buttocks resting on the soles of your feet. then bend forward at the waist  walking your fingers forward as far as you can go while trying to touch your nose to the floor. while standing  place both hands behind your head and slowly push your head backwards while arching or extending your spine so that your stomach sticks out. while standing with your feet shoulder width apart  for stability and balance   place your arms in front of you  bent at the elbows  and in a controlled fashion  rotate your upper body as far as you can in one direction  then switch and do the other way a few seconds later.    rolling on a piece of firm foam is a good way to massage your back and potentially relieve mild to moderate discomfort  especially in the mid back  thoracic  region. foam rollers are commonly used in physiotherapy  yoga and pilates.pick up a foam roller at a sporting goods or big box store   they re very inexpensive and nearly indestructible. place the foam roller on the ground  perpendicular to where you re going to lay your body. lie down on your back so that the foam roller is beneath your shoulders. your body and the roller should form a  t  shape. put your feet flat on the floor  bend your knees  and lift up your lower back so it rolls over the foam in a back and forth manner. use your feet to move your body over the foam  so that your entire spine is massaged  at least 10 minutes . repeat as many times as necessary  although your muscles might be a little sore after the first time you use a foam roller.    medical specialists such as an orthopedist  neurologist  or rheumatologist may be needed to rule out the most serious causes of your upper back pain  such as infection  osteomyelitis   cancer  osteoporosis  spinal fracture  herniated disc  or rheumatoid arthritis.these conditions are not common causes of upper back pain  but if home care and conservative therapies are not effective  then more serious problems need to be considered.   x rays  bone scans  mri  ct scan and ultrasound are modalities that specialists may use to help diagnose your upper back pain. your doctor may also send you for a blood test to rule out rheumatoid arthritis or a spinal infection.    your upper back pain may be caused by chronic joint inflammation. a facet joint injection involves real time fluoroscopic  x ray  guidance of a needle through the back muscles and into the inflamed or irritated spinal joint  followed by a release of an anesthetic and corticosteroid mixture  which quickly relieves both pain and inflammation at the site. facet joint injections take 20   30 minutes to do and the results can last from a few weeks to a few months.facet joint injections are limited to three within a six month time frame. the pain relief benefits from facet joint injections typically begin on the second or third day post treatment. until that time  your back pain may get a little worse. potential complications of facet joint injections include infection  bleeding  local muscle atrophy  and nerve irritation damage.    scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine that usually occurs in young people before puberty.it can cause pain in the upper and middle back. you may not notice mild forms of scoliosis  but even mild scoliosis can cause pain or worsen over time  leading to more serious complications such as lung and heart damage or changes to the body s appearance  such as uneven shoulders and hips and a prominent rib cage.the doctor will check for scoliosis by asking the person to bend forward at the waist so he can see if one side of the ribs sticks out more than the other side.the doctor may also check for muscle weakness  numbness  and abnormal reflexes.learn more about managing pain caused by scoliosis by reading this article  relieve back pain from scoliosis.    surgery for back pain is the last resort and should only be considered after all other conservative therapies are proven ineffective and if the cause warrants such invasive techniques.reasons for upper back surgery may include to repair or stabilize a fracture  from trauma or osteoporosis   to remove a tumor  to repair a herniated disc  or to combat a deformity such as scoliosis.   spinal surgery may involve the use of metal rods  pins or other devices for structural support. possible complications from back surgery include local infection  allergic reaction to anesthesia  nerve damage  paralysis  and chronic swelling and or pain.    a strained muscle occurs when individual muscle fibers are taken beyond their tensile limits and subsequently tear  which leads to pain  inflammation and some degree of guarding  muscle spasm in attempts to prevent further damage . a deep tissue massage is helpful for mild to moderate strains because it reduces muscle spasm  combats inflammation  and promotes relaxation.start with a 30 minute massage  focusing on your upper back and lower neck areas. allow the therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate without wincing.   always drink lots of water immediately following a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by products  lactic acid  and toxins from your body. failure to do so might cause a headache or mild nausea. as an alternative to professional massage therapy  position a tennis ball underneath your body and between your shoulder blades  or wherever your upper back pain is . roll on the ball slowly for 10   15 minutes a few times daily until the pain subsides.    chiropractors and osteopaths are spinal specialists that focus on establishing normal motion and function of the small spinal joints that connect the vertebrae  called spinal facet joints.manual joint manipulation  also called an adjustment  can be used to unjam or reposition facet joints that are slightly misaligned  which triggers inflammation and sharp pain  particularly with movement. you can often hear a  popping  sound with a spinal adjustment. traction techniques or stretching of your spine may also help your upper back pain.   although a single spinal adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your back issue  more than likely it will take three to five treatments to notice significant results. chiropractors and osteopaths also use a variety of therapies tailored more towards muscle strains  which may be more appropriate for your upper back issue. a chiropractor or osteopath may help with improving mobility in the joints.    if your upper back problem is recurring  chronic  and caused by weak spinal muscles  poor posture or degenerative conditions such as osteoarthritis  then you need to consider some form of rehabilitation. a physical therapist can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your upper back.physiotherapy is usually required two to three times per week for four to eight weeks to positively impact chronic back problems.   if need be  a physical therapist can treat your sore muscles with electrotherapy such as therapeutic ultrasound or electronic muscle stimulation. good strengthening exercises for your upper back include swimming  rowing  and back extensions  but make sure your injury is resolved first.    acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into specific energy points within the skin in effort to reduce pain and inflammation.acupuncture for back pain can be effective  especially if it s done when the symptoms first occur. based on the principles of traditional chinese medicine  acupuncture works by releasing a variety of substances including endorphins and serotonin  which act to reduce pain.   it s also claimed that acupuncture stimulates the flow of energy  referred to as chi. acupuncture is practiced by a variety of health professionals including some physicians  chiropractors  naturopaths  physical therapists  and massage therapists.    though it may initially seem counter intuitive to see a mental health professional for physical pain  cognitive behavioral therapy has shown to help reduce stress and back pain in many people.keeping a pain diary can also help you deal with your pain and it can be useful information to bring to your doctor. stress relieving practices like meditation  tai chi  and breathing exercises have been found to help alleviate chronic pain and help prevent future injury.

night. a quality night s rest is unlikely with fewer than 6 hours of sleep.do not oversleep. while sleep is important  oversleeping may also negatively impact memory. try not to exceed 9 hours a night under regular circumstances.  a healthy brain starts from within  but maintaining a healthy social life helps keep the mind sharp. regular  friendly engagement with others may help boost short term cognitive function.try activities that require you to think about another person s mental processes. games that involve strategy  including video games and role playing games  are good options. get to know a new person. engaging in brief  amicable conversations with someone can boost your brain function. try talking to someone new  or learning a new thing about an old friend. have dinner with friends or family. talk about your day  and allow others to share with you. worry less about what you do and more about who you do it with. times where people actively talk with their friends are the most beneficial for the brain  so spend a little time each day talking to people you truly like.    some studies suggest that volunteering may help maintain healthy brain function. one johns hopkins university study found that older adults tutoring children delayed declining brain function.no one quite knows what volunteer activities are best for brain function  but some professionals speculate that stimulating activities such as teaching  tutoring  or reading may be the most beneficial.pick a cause you care about. a 2012 study found that only people who volunteer for truly altruistic reasons get the health benefits of volunteering.call local schools  community centers  and youth groups to see if they need help teaching or tutoring. check with your local animal shelter to see if there are volunteer opportunities available walking animals or at adoption events. ask your local seniors center about teaching a continuing education course for the senior community. food pantries and soup kitchens often lack volunteers after the holidays season. ask about their year round opportunities.    pets  particularly dogs and cats  do wonders for their owners. not only do pets help heart health  they also reduce stress and improve your mood  both of which help make your brain stronger.call your local animal shelter and ask about the pets available for adoption. schedule a visit to meet the animals. make sure you have the resources to properly take care of a pet. ask the shelter  does this animal have any special needs   and contact a local vet and ask about pet health plans. talk to the shelter about a proper setup for the pet. ask  what type of food does this pet need   and  how much activity should this pet get   make sure to talk about the pet s schedule so that you know what it needs daily  weekly  monthly  and annually. set aside time daily to play and bond with your pet. that helps both of you stay mentally strong and happy.

Can you get permanent nerve damage from carpal tunnel? How long does carpal tunnel last? Can I use my hand after carpal tunnel surgery?  the carpal tunnel within your wrist is a narrow passageway made up of small carpal bones and ligaments. the tunnel protects nerves  blood vessels and tendons that go into your hand. the main nerve that innervates your hand is called the median nerve.avoid activities that compress and irritate the median nerve such as repetitively flexing your wrist  lifting heavy weights with your hands  sleeping with bent wrists and punching solid objects.   wearing tight bracelets and watches may be a risk factor also  so make sure to leave ample space. in many cases of carpal tunnel syndrome  a single cause is difficult to identify. often it involves a combination of factors  such as arthritis or diabetes combined with repetitive strain in the wrist. the wrist anatomy of people can make a difference   some have naturally smaller passageways in their wrists or have carpal bones that are positioned oddly.    stretching your wrists on a regular basis can be effective at reducing or minimizing carpal tunnel symptoms.in particular  wrist extensions can help make more room for the median nerve in the carpal tunnel by stretching the ligaments that attach to the carpal bones. the easiest way to extend and stretch both wrists at the same time is the  prayer pose  with your palms together. put your palms together in front of your chest and raise your elbows until you feel a nice stretch in your wrists. hold for 30 seconds and repeat 3 5x daily.   you can also grab the fingers of the affected hand and pull backwards until you feel a stretch at the front of your wrist. you may feel more temporary tingling in your hand with this stretch  but don t stop unless you feel pain. in addition to hand tingling  other symptoms commonly associated with carpal tunnel syndrome are  numbness  throbbing pain  muscle weakness and color changes  too pale or too red . the only part of the wrist   hand typically spared symptoms is the little finger   it s not innervated by the median nerve.    the symptoms of carpal tunnel are often related to having inflammation   swelling in the wrist  which either directly irritates the median nerve or crowds  pinches  it. as such  taking otc non steroidal anti inflammatories  nsaids   such as ibuprofen  motrin  advil  or naproxen  aleve   can be very helpful to reduce symptoms short term.painkillers such as acetaminophen  tylenol  paracetamol  can be used for carpal tunnel also  but they don t impact swelling  only the pain.   anti inflammatories and analgesics should be considered short term strategies for pain control. there isn t any evidence that these drugs improve carpal tunnel syndrome in the long term.taking too many nsaids or taking them for too long significantly increases your risk of stomach irritation  ulcers and kidney failure. taking too much acetaminophen or taking it for too can cause liver damage. as an alternative  rub an ointment that contains a natural pain reliever into your sore wrist   hand. menthol  camphor  arnica and capsaicin are all helpful for relieving mild to moderate pain.    if your wrist is sore and looks or feels swollen  then apply a small bag of crushed ice  or something cold  to it in order to reduce inflammation and numb the pain. doing so may also reduce hand symptoms. cold therapy is most effective for soft tissue injuries that involve some sort of swelling because it reduces blood flow.apply the crushed ice to your wrist for about 5 10 minutes 3 5x daily until the symptoms subside.   compressing the ice against your wrist with a stretchy tensor or ace bandage is even more effective for fighting inflammation. always wrap ice in a thin cloth before applying it skin   it prevents skin irritation or frostbite. if crushed ice isn t available  use a large ice cube  frozen gel pack or small bag of frozen veggies instead. in some cases  cold therapy may aggravate the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. avoid ice if that s the case with you.    wearing a rigid brace or splint that holds your wrist in a neutral position during the day may reduce the compression or irritation of the median nerve and help with carpal tunnel symptoms.splints or wrist braces can also be worn during activities that aggravate symptoms  such as working at the computer  bowling or carrying groceries. wearing splints while you sleep can help relieve nighttime symptoms of tingling and numbness in your hands  especially if you have a habit of curling your wrists.you may need to wear a splint for several weeks  day and night  to get significant relief from carpal tunnel symptoms. for some sufferers  splints and braces provide negligible benefit. splinting at night can be a good idea if you re pregnant and have carpal tunnel syndrome because pregnancy tends to increase swelling  edema  in the hands and feet. wrist splints and braces can be purchased at most pharmacies and medical supply stores.    some sleeping postures can aggravate the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.sleeping with your fists clenched and wrists tucked in  flexed  is the worst position  but having your arms extended above your head is not great either. instead  sleep on your back or side with your arms at your sides  and try to keep your hands open and your wrists in a neutral position. wearing a wrist splint or brace is very helpful in this regard  although it takes a little getting used to.   don t sleep on your stomach with your hands   wrists compressed under your pillow. people who do this frequently wake up with numb and tingly hands. most wrist splints and braces are made of nylon and fasten with velcro  which can irritate other parts of your body. consider covering your splint with a sock or thin cloth to reduce irritating other body parts.    your carpal tunnel problem may be caused or aggravated by a poorly designed work station. if your computer keyboard  mouse  desk and or chair isn t positioned properly for your height and body proportions  it can put strain on your wrists  shoulders  neck and mid back. make sure your keyboard is low enough so that your wrists are not constantly bent upwards while typing.consider getting an ergonomic keyboard and mouse  designed to take the stress off your wrists and hands.   putting cushioned pads underneath your keyboard and mouse can lessen the impact on your hands and wrists. have an occupational therapist review your body positions while performing your job. people who work on computers for many hours each day are at higher risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.  if you are feeling any carpal tunnel symptoms in your wrist and hand that persist for more than a few weeks  then see your doctor for an examination. your doctor may take x rays and blood tests to rule out other causes of wrist   hand pain  such as rheumatoid arthritis  osteoarthritis  advanced diabetes  hairline fractures or vascular problems.   electrodiagnostic studies  emg and nerve conduction  are usually done to confirm the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome.your doctor will see if you can perform certain tasks that are difficult with carpal tunnel syndrome  such as  making a tight fist  pinching your thumb and forefinger together and manipulating small objects with precision.your doctor may ask about your profession  as certain jobs are at high risk  carpenters  cashiers  assembly line workers  musicians  auto mechanics and people who work on computers for long hours.    your doctor may recommend injecting the carpal tunnel area of your wrist with corticosteroid medication  such as cortisone  to relieve the pain  inflammation and other symptoms.corticosteroids are strong and fast acting anti inflammatories that can quickly decrease swelling in your wrist  which relieves pressure on the median nerve. taking oral corticosteroids  by mouth  is another option  but these drugs are not considered as effective as injections and they come with significant side effects.   other common corticosteroid medications used for carpal tunnel syndrome are prednisolone  dexamethasone and triamcinolone. potential complications of corticosteroid injections include local infection  bleeding  tendon weakening  local muscle atrophy and nerve irritation   damage. as such  injections are limited to 2 per year. if corticosteroid injections fail to significantly reduce the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome  then surgery should be considered.    if all other remedies and treatments fail to give you relief  then your doctor will likely recommend carpal tunnel surgery. surgery should be considered as a last resort  although it can completely relieve your symptoms for good with minimal risk  so it should not be considered as a long shot. the goal of surgery is to relieve pressure on the median nerve by cutting the ligament pressing on it.however  carpal tunnel surgery can be performed in two different ways  endoscopic or open surgery.   endoscopic surgery involves uses a telescope like device with a tiny camera on the end  endoscope   which is inserted through a small incision in your wrist or hand. the endoscope can see inside the carpal tunnel and cut the problematic ligament. endoscopic surgery typically results in the least amount of pain and the quickest recovery. open surgery involves making a larger incision in the palm of your hand and over your wrist in order to cut through the problematic ligament  which frees the nerve. surgery risks include  nerve damage  infection and scar tissue formation.    following the surgery  it s done on an outpatient basis   you ll be asked to often elevate your hand above your heart and move your fingers  which reduces swelling and prevents stiffness.mild pain  swelling and stiffness in the palm and wrist can be expected post surgery for up to 6 months  and complete recovery may take a year. for the first 2 4 weeks  you may be required to wear a splint or brace  although using your hand is encouraged.   most people s symptoms get much better after surgery  but recovery is often slow and gradual. on average  hand strength returns to normal 2 months after surgery.carpal tunnel syndrome can occasionally recur  about 10  of the time  and may require additional surgery.

What can be used for DNA testing? Can you get a DNA test from a toothbrush? What can be used for DNA testing? How long does DNA last in hair?  this will depend on what the sample is for. if you want laboratory results from your sample  you will likely have to purchase a kit. if you plan on storing the sample in case it is one day needed  you may not need a kit  although you may still choose to purchase one if you like.   dna test kits contain all of the materials you will need  along with complete instructions and consent forms  which are needed if the samples will be tested or kept on file with the authorities.    in most cases  dna samples cannot be collected at home if they are to be used in court. while home paternity tests are useful for your own knowledge  you will likely need to go to a lab and have your dna collected by a professional if you need to use the results for matters involving custody or child support.    if you are using a kit  there will be very specific instructions for what kind of sample to collect. if you are sending your samples to a lab without a kit  check with them to see what kinds of samples they prefer.   most dna kits request either buccal  cheek  swabs or saliva samples. hair samples are also popular. it is possible to extract dna from almost any human sample  including nails  blood  sperm  and items that contain saliva  such as chewing gum. some samples  however  are easier to extract from than others. if you choose a non preferred sample type  the lab might not be able to extract dna  or it might be more expensive.  no matter what kind of sample you collect  do not touch it with your hands or place it on a contaminated surface. this is especially important if you are collecting a dna sample from someone else because you could potentially contaminate the sample with your own dna.wash your hands before you begin and always wear gloves.    if the collection involves a swab  tweezers  or clippers  these should be sterile  and you should avoid touching the part of the equipment that will come in contact with the specimen.metal equipment can be sterilized with alcohol or by boiling in water.    kits will provide you with collection containers and instructions for storing it properly.   paper envelopes are the best storage containers for most non liquid samples. do not store hair specimens or a damp buccal swab in plastic  as this will retain moisture and potentially damage the dna.if storing the specimen in an envelope  do not lick the seal  as this could contaminate the sample. if you plan on storing the specimen for potential use in the future  label it with the name of the person from whom the specimen was collected  the date that it was collected  and the name of the person who collected it.keep your sample away from moisture  extreme temperatures  and chemicals.    if you are using a dna kit  the instructions will be very clear  so follow them closely. if you are mailing your sample to a lab but not using a kit  be sure to clarify shipping instructions.    for buccal swabs  scrape your inner cheek with a sterile swab for up to one minute. scrape vigorously  but not to the point that it hurts. continue swabbing for at least 30 60 seconds. once finished  be sure not to touch the end of the swab to any surface other than the inside of your mouth and the inside of the container.kits often request more than one swab  just in case one does not contain dna. if you are not using a kit  you may still wish to use multiple swabs. to improve the amount of dna retrieved  take the two  or more  samples from different sides of the mouth  or take them several hours apart. refrain from eating  drinking anything other than water  smoking  chewing gum  brushing your teeth  or using mouthwash for at least one hour before taking the test.rinse the mouth with warm water ten minutes before swabbing. if testing on a baby  allow her to drink water from her bottle before testing. allow the swab to dry before storing.   when collecting hair samples  check to make sure that the follicle  which looks like a small white bulb  is still attached.avoid using hairs from a hairbrush or clothing. you also cannot use cut hair. do not touch the follicle end of the hairs. getting hair samples might hurt  especially if the hair is shiny and strong.    the easiest way to do this is to drool into your collection container. if you are using a kit  you may be provided with sponges to facilitate the collection of saliva from small children.refrain from eating  drinking anything other than water  smoking  chewing gum  brushing your teeth  or using mouthwash for at least one hour before taking the test. rinse the mouth with warm water ten minutes before collecting the sample  in order to remove any food particles. if testing on a baby  allow her to drink water from her bottle before testing.    if you plan on collecting less common samples  such as fingernails  blood  or semen  take every precaution to avoid touching or otherwise contaminating them. check with the lab you plan on sending the specimen to in order to confirm that they are able to extract dna from the sample you are collecting.  
query	78	hepatitis c diagnose  since hepatitis c is a disease of the liver  some of its earliest and most prominent signs indicate a lack of liver function. urine that is especially dark in color may indicate your liver is not filtering out bilirubin properly.dark urine means colors that range from orange  amber  brown  or even cola colored urine. there are other things that can cause discoloration in urine such as certain vitamins in large amounts  medications  a kidney infection or even dehydration. if you notice a consistent change over the course of many days in your urine color and your medication or vitamin intake hasn t changed  make sure to get checked out by a doctor to understand the cause.    jaundice is a yellowing of the skin. it is most commonly seen in parts of the body like face  fingers  and a yellowing of the whites of eyes. much like darkly colored urine  jaundice is caused by a concentration of bilirubin  indicating that the body is not properly filtering. since hepatitis c is a liver disease  it can directly affect the liver s normal function of filtering bilirubin. if you notice your skin yellowing  you should quickly have your blood checked to make sure you do not have too much bilirubin in your body.just like dark colored urine  there are more benign explanations  such as gilbert s disease  an inherited condition with no associated complications.    clay colored stool can indicate there is a biliary system issue  the liver being a major culprit. the liver typically releases bile salts into your stool  giving it the normal brownish color. when stool does not turn brownish and remains pale  this indicates a problem that may be affecting the release of bile.   this is particularly important if you notice this in conjunction with other symptoms  such as jaundice and or dark colored urine.    although this can many times just be the flu or a common sickness  it can also be an indication that your body is in the early stages of fighting off hepatitis c. if you notice symptoms such as mild fever  fatigue  vomiting and a loss of appetite accompanied with any indication of liver malfunction  this can be an early sign of the disease. even if it is just an ordinary sickness  a doctor will be able to run simple tests to narrow down what s making you feel ill.   other common symptoms include fatigue  the most common complaint   nausea  loss of appetite  muscle pain  weakness and weight loss. several non liver related conditions are associated with chronic hepatitis c infection  including diabetes mellitus  autoimmune disorders and kidney disease.    as many as 70   80  of those who contract the disease may be asymptomatic. this early phase  known as the acute phase of hepatitis c  is often mild and can go unnoticed. it may just seem like a common ailment  with nothing too serious developing.  over time symptoms of hepatitis c can become severe. the development of cirrhosis is a common progression of hepatitis c. this is when the liver becomes so scarred and hardened by the disease it is no longer able to heal itself. the most common symptoms of cirrhosis is fluid retention in the abdominal area  jaundice  and even abnormal bleeding  particularly in the stomach or esophagus. by the time these symptoms take hold  urgent medical care is needed.between five and 30  of patients with chronic hepatitis c go on to develop cirrhosis over a 20   30 year time span. in the later stages of hepatitis c  full on liver failure may take hold. this may also bring on mental symptoms like confusion. sometimes a liver transplant may be needed but recurrence of the disease is common.  you will want to make an appointment with a primary healthcare provider who can move forward with testing  whether you re in the early or latter stages of the disease. they may refer you to a specialist in liver disease  infectious diseases  or a specialist in stomach and intestinal problems.  this test screens for infection by testing for the presence of antibodies of the disease  indicating your body is trying to fight the virus. this test is useful because it can tell whether you have an active bout of the infection your body is dealing with  or whether you previously had the disease.there is recent evidence that a weak positive may set off a false positive of the test. so depending on the level of the antibodies  you may want to be retested.most patient that contract hepatitis c develop antibodies two to six months after exposure to the virus.    this is a test that looks at genetic material  rna  of the virus. this is used to measure the viral load in your body. this is a very accurate test and is typically only done if the hepatitis c antibody test is positive  unless acute infection or recent exposure is suspected.   other types of viral load tests include  tma  transcription mediated amplification   pcr  polymerase chain reaction   and bdna  branched dna   with the latter being the least sensitive.  there are seven different genotypes of the hepatitis c virus. the genotype is important because it will dictate the type and length of treatment  as well as the likelihood of a cure.    many of the symptoms of hepatitis c can mimic other liver ailments  however  some may not appear at all. you can gain a better understanding of your risks by evaluating behaviors that may have increased the likelihood of you contracting the disease.   actions that involve the transference and exchange of blood put you at risk to contract hepatitis c  particularly if it s done carelessly. sharing drugs or needles and being stuck with an infected needle are two particularly risky behaviors. using shared tattoo needles is a sometimes the cause of hepatitis c infection  particularly in the prison population. if you have a disease that requires the legitimate use of needles  always take the utmost care to use sanitized  new needles. make sure to only use needles once and dispose of them properly. never share needles  even for medication.    blood transfusions and organ transplants done before 1992 did not adhere to standards that screened hepatitis c. if you received a transplant or blood transfusion before this date  you should get tested if symptoms appear.people with hiv can also have a greater chance of contracting hepatitis c. since their disease was likely contracted due to bodily fluid exchange   in some cases blood   the risk is higher. those who routinely receive long term kidney dialysis are more susceptible than others. hepatitis c can be passed from women to their children during childbirth. if you are a woman and your child has symptoms of hepatitis c  it may be a good idea for both of you to be checked. similarly  if you later find out your mother had hepatitis c you will want to get checked if the timeframe is possible.    hepatitis c can be contracted through unprotected sex with a carrier of the disease. avoid having unprotected sex with multiple partners  particularly if you do not know whether they may carry the disease.

How can I fall asleep in 10 seconds?  to help cure your insomnia  make your bedroom or sleeping area as inviting and calm as possible.your environment should also be relatively quiet  although many people can get accustomed to some background noise. focus on the comfort of your sleeping area and save your bed for only sleep  sex and light reading  not eating  studying  watching tv  texting on your phone or paying bills  as it can lead to higher quality and duration of sleep.if you live in a noisy neighborhood  consider wearing earplugs or buying a white noise machine. white noise  like the sound of static  drowns out other more distracting noises. make your bed with comfortable sheets that don t make you too hot or cold at night. in general  try to keep your room cool   around 60   65 f  though this may be too cold or impractical for some .wait until you re comfortably drowsy to go to bed and don t try too hard to fall asleep. if you can t sleep  get out of bed after 20 minutes and do something relaxing.    for your body to think that it s time to fall asleep  your sleeping environment has to be relatively dark  although many people can get accustomed to some amount of light.darkness triggers the release of hormones  such as melatonin  in your brain that initiate the  sleep cascade  and promote deep sleep. as such  close all your blinds and turn off all sources of illumination that your can see from your bed. don t browse the internet on your phone while in bed  as the bright screen can make you more alert and less drowsy.   use thick black out shades to prevent light from coming in through your windows  or wear a sleep mask over your eyes. avoid bright  and noisy  alarm clocks and remove them from view. once you set your alarm  hide your clock so the light and time don t distract you. watching the time can increase anxiety and make insomnia worse.  it s important to develop relaxing rituals in the latter part of the evening to prepare your mind and body for sleep. work  school  exercise  paying the bills and preparing meals can all be stressful  so having activities to help you unwind before bedtime can help promote better sleep and either combat insomnia or reduce the risk of it developing. various relaxation techniques are proven to calm the brain and body  such as progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing techniques.   progressive muscle relaxation or pmr teaches you how to relax your muscles through a 2  step process  first  you intentionally tense muscle groups in your body  such as your neck and shoulders  next  you release the tension  focusing intensely on one body part at a time. try this each night before bedtime. deep breathing techniques prior to bed can help you relax and get to sleep. place a hand on your lower abdomen and breathe in deeply so your hand rises  called stomach breathing . hold your breath for a count of three and then exhale fully and watch your hand fall.do these 3x per night. a warm bath can also help cure insomnia. make sure the water isn t too hot and add a couple scoops of epsom salts   it s rich with magnesium  which can absorb through your skin and relax muscles.light some candles. soak in the tub for 20 30 minutes while reading something light and funny. avoid doing anything too stimulating or stressful on the computer  or phone  and don t watch scary or action movies that get your adrenaline going.  don t eat right before bed because it can lead to a burst of energy  a sugar rush  for example  and increase your risk of painful heartburn   but going to bed hungry can also keep you up. a grumbling stomach and hunger pains distracts from sleep and helps to promote insomnia  especially if your mind is fixated on food. as such  don t go much more than 3 4 hours without food before going to bed.   if you need a snack after dinner  stick to healthy and light stuff  such as fruit  veggies  low fat dairy and whole grains. some foods  especially poultry  contain amino acids  tryptophan and glutamine  that promote sleepiness. thus  consider having a turkey sandwich on whole grain bread for an evening snack. avoid eating snacks  particularly spicy stuff  within an hour of bedtime. this strategy will let your gi system properly digest the food and allow for any energy rush to subside.    concerns with finances  work  school  relationships and your general social life often lead to stress  which can trigger short term or long term insomnia.trying to reduce or manage your daily stressors promotes better sleep and help to cure insomnia. don t be afraid to make significant life changes to free yourself from stressful situations  because insomnia is only one symptom of chronic stress   anxiety attacks  depression  headaches  high blood pressure and heart disease are others.   be reasonable about your obligations and responsibilities. many people get stressed because they are over committed or over scheduled. don t promise what you can t reasonably deliver. feel free to reduce contact with people who bring you lots of stress.manage your time better. if running late causes you stress  leave for work a little early each day. plan ahead and be realistic. use moderate exercise to handle stress instead of binge eating. people who are stress tend to binge eat on  feel good  food  but this can lead to weight gain and depression. instead  be active and go exercise when stressed out  see below . talk to friends and family members about stressful issues. simply venting about your stressful issues can help. if no one is around  write your feelings down in a journal.    regular physical activity during the daytime can help regulate your sleep cycle at night  which is a good strategy for combating insomnia. it can give you a boost of energy and invigorate you initially  but the strenuous effort and increased breathing of oxygen makes you tired and sleepy at night. if you don t have a regular exercise routine already  strive for at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity  walking  hiking  biking  swimming  per day.establishing an exercise routine takes effort. try to be active at the same time each day  either early in the morning  during your lunch break  or right after work before you eat. exercise also promotes weight loss  which can reduce annoying aches and pain  make you more comfortable in bed at night  and reduce the risk of snoring and other breathing problems. don t engage in vigorous exercise too close to bedtime because your body produces adrenaline and it will prevent you from falling asleep quickly. make sure your workouts occur 5 6 five hours prior to bedtime.  while alcohol may help some people fall asleep faster  it can disrupt sleep patterns and reduce the quality of your sleep. you may even find yourself waking up in middle of the night and struggling to fall asleep again. cut down on the amount of alcohol that you drink  and stop consuming any alcoholic drinks at least an hour before you go to bed.  nicotine is a stimulant  and it can keep you awake if used too close to your bedtime. nicotine is most commonly found in cigarettes. since smoking is bad for your health  you should try to quit smoking entirely.if you are still using nicotine products  stop smoking or chewing nicotine gum a few hours before bedtime. nicotine is found in cigarettes  cigars  and smokeless tobacco. there are also nicotine patches and chewing gums meant to help you quit smoking. these can all make it more difficult for you to sleep.    caffeine is a stimulant that can disturb sleep in people. the effects can last as long as 8 hours.thus  as a general rule  avoid caffeine anytime after lunch.caffeine increases the activity of brain neurons  which may cause your mind  to race  with more thoughts and ideas. coffee  black tea  green tea  hot chocolate  dark chocolate  colas  some other sodas and virtually all energy drinks are significant sources of caffeine. some cold medications also contain caffeine. keep in mind that sugar  especially the heavily processed types  is also a stimulant and should be avoided for at least an hour before heading to bed.    if some short term sleeplessness has transitioned into full blown insomnia  despite your efforts with lifestyle changes   then make an appointment with your doctor. your doctor will try to determine if you have an underlying medical condition that s causing or contributing to your insomnia. if so  then treatment should focus on the underlying heath condition first and the sleeping difficulty should then fade away secondarily.   common causes of insomnia include  chronic pain  depression  restless leg syndrome  sleep apnea  severe snoring   bladder control problems  arthritis  cancer  hyperthyroidism  overactive thyroid   menopause  heart disease  lung disease  and chronic heartburn.ask your doctor if any of your prescription drugs can potentially trigger insomnia   problematic drugs include those used for depression  hypertension  allergies  weight loss and adhd  such as ritalin . check the labels of any medications you take regularly. if they contain caffeine or stimulants like pseudoephedrine they may be causing your insomnia.  if your doctor thinks it s necessary or helpful  they may prescribe medication to help you get to sleep. some drugs are better for short term insomnia  recently acquired   whereas others are more powerful and better for long term  chronic  insomnia. most doctors don t prescribe drugs for insomnia in conjunction with different drugs to treat other underlying medical issues.mixing different drug classes increases the risk of side effects  see below .   first choice sleeping pills for short term insomnia include eszopiclone  ramelteon  zaleplon and

rapid eye movement  phase of sleep compared to people who sleep normally. rem sleep should occur about 90 minutes after falling asleep   intense dreams happen in this stage. people with insomnia also have difficulty initiating non rem sleep to start with  but once there  often don t transition to deep non rem and finally rem sleep.    there are many plant based remedies or natural supplements that act as mild sedatives and help to cure insomnia if there isn t an underlying medical condition. natural herbal medicine is generally very safe in terms of toxicity if you follow instructions on the label. they also don t lead to the potentially serious side effects that many sleeping pills do. the most commonly used natural sleep aids are valerian root  chamomile  and melatonin.   valerian root has a mild sedating effective on people  which leads to sleepiness.you can take it as a capsule or drink it as a herbal tea for 1 2 weeks at a time. in very high doses  valerian root can have a

What does the kidney do?  you can choose to donate a kidney directly to someone you know  but only if you are a compatible match. you also have the option of donating to a stranger or participating in a paired exchange donation  which means you will donate your kidney to a stranger on the condition that a compatible stranger also donates a kidney to your loved one.some kidney transplant centers allow you to be a good samaritan donor  which means you can initiate a chain of donations by donating your kidney to a stranger. when you donate your kidney  the recipient s loved one will donate hers  and so on and so forth. this will probably not directly impact anyone you know personally  but it will help a lot of people. if you don t want to donate your kidney while you are still alive  but you want to help someone after you die  you can register to donate all of your organs or specific organs by signing up on your specific state s registry or indicating your preferences on your driver s license.    once you have decided that you would like to donate a kidney  you must contact a transplant center in order to initiate your application. the transplant center should have a nurse available to answer all of your questions and help you decide if donation is really right for you.if you are donating to a specific person  you must contact the transplant center that has approved them for a transplant. if the person has not yet been approved  you will not be able to proceed with donating your kidney until that happens.if you are not doing a direct donation  you have a choice regarding which facility you work with. contact multiple facilities and ask questions regarding their success rates  their policies for matching donors and recipients  and the financial assistance they offer in order to choose the right one for you. consult the u.s. department of health and human services  organ procurement and transplantation network for a complete list of transplant centers in the united states.  if you want to donate to a specific person  you will need to undergo blood testing to determine if you are a match. the initial screening involves a simple blood test.you must have a compatible blood type in order to donate your kidney to a specific individual. people who have type a blood can accept blood from donors with type a or type o. people with type b blood can receive blood from people with type b or type o. people with type ab blood can receive blood from someone with any blood type. people with type o blood can only receive blood from a donor with type o blood. the antibodies in your blood must also be compatible with those in the recipient s blood. in general  the more antibodies that recipient has  the more difficult it will be to find a match. doctors also consider antigen matching. you do not need to be an exact match in order to donate  but research has found that an exact match does increase the success rate of the transplant. if you have passed all of the other tests  doctors will then perform a cross matching test  which may actually be a series of several tests. doctors will collect cells and serum  blood without the cells in it  from both the donor and the recipient and mix them together to see if the recipient s body is likely to reject the donor s organ. if these tests come back negative  you will be considered a match. keep in mind that if you are not a match for your loved one  you still have the option of participating in a paired exchange donation program  which will greatly increase the chances that your loved one will receive a kidney in a timely fashion.  in order to donate a kidney  you must be healthy enough to undergo surgery and to do well afterward with only one kidney. you also must have a sufficiently low risk of developing kidney problems in the future.your doctor will likely perform blood tests  urine tests  x rays  an ekg  and a ct angiogram to check your overall health and look for any abnormalities of your kidneys.certain chronic conditions  such as diabetes and liver disease  may disqualify you from donating your kidney. if you are a smoker  you will be required to quit at least one month before undergoing surgery to have your kidney removed.you may also be disqualified from donating a kidney if you have certain diseases that could be passed on to the recipient  such as hiv or hepatitis. you will also be required to undergo a psychological examination in order to confirm that you are aware of the risks of donating your kidney and are choosing to do it of your own free will. if you have any health conditions  you might require a pre surgical clearance from your treating doctor in order to be approved for surgery.    donating a kidney requires that you undergo major surgery  and this is not without risks. make sure to talk to your doctor about the risks before you agree to undergo surgery  and always ask if you have an increased risk of complications for any reason. although rare  some risks of surgery include the following bleeding infection blood clots in the lung  pulmonary embolism  death    kidney donors do not usually have shorter lifespans or a diminished quality of life as a result of the surgery.there are  however  some long term risks to keep in mind.   while your body is perfectly capable of functioning normally with only one kidney  you will be at a disadvantage should your remaining kidney fail. if you end up needing a kidney transplant  you will be given preference as a prior donor.kidney donors may have a somewhat higher chance of developing high blood pressure.having only one kidney may prevent you from being eligible for certain military  police  and fire fighting jobs.  most of the time  your medical expenses will be covered by either the recipient s insurance or by the transplant center if you choose to donate a kidney. make sure to find out if you will be responsible for any costs. also  keep in mind that the surgery may have many hidden costs that are not covered. the following expenses are typically not covered  although you may be able to get help with them by contacting a nonprofit agency expenses for travel to and from the transplant center childcare lost wages during your recovery period medical expenses related to long term surgical complications    there are two different surgeries your doctor may perform to remove your kidney  an open incision removal and a laparoscopic procedure. the laparoscopic procedure is much less invasive  which means there are fewer risks involved and the recovery time is shorter.a laparoscopic procedure means that instead of making a large incision and the surgeon using their hands to do the surgery inside your body  a very small set of incisions are made and instruments with long handles are inserted into the holes. the surgeon uses the instruments to do the surgery without ever opening up the abdomen. the laparoscopic procedure may not be an option for all patients  depending on their surgical histories and the anatomy of the individual s kidney and whether it can be accessed and removed with the laparoscopic instruments alone.    your doctor will give you specific instructions that you must follow prior to surgery. most commonly  you will be restricted from eating and drinking in the hours leading up to your surgery  usually beginning the night before. this is to prevent aspiration of food into your lungs when you are under anesthesia. it is very important to follow these and all other instructions  as they are meant to reduce your risk of surgical complications.make sure your doctor knows about all of the medications you are taking. you may be required to stop some medications prior to surgery.    depending on the type of surgery and a host of personal factors  recovery typically takes anywhere between one and six weeks. you should expect to experience pain  discomfort  and fatigue while you recover.it s a good idea to have a caretaker available to help you with daily activities  like preparing meals and you may have to spend a few days recovering in the hospital before you are sent home. people who are in good shape tend to recover from surgery faster than people who are out of shape  so you might want to begin an exercise regimen before your surgery.moving around in the days following your surgery will help you avoid complications  such as blood clots.  your doctor will probably have you come in for at least one post surgical check up. the purpose of this is to make sure you are healing properly  so be sure to go to all scheduled appointments.it is also important to continue getting regular medical checkups throughout your life. your doctor may want to monitor your kidney function to make sure your remaining kidney is functioning properly.    when you are released from the hospital  your doctor will give you a list of activities that you should avoid for certain periods of time. these restrictions are meant to help you heal and to protect you from injury  so it is very important that you follow them.you should not do any heavy lifting in the weeks following your surgery. your doctor will provide you with specific guidelines. depending on the type of work you do  you may not be medically cleared to return to work for several weeks. the more strenuous your job  the longer you will be out of work. women are typically advised not to become pregnant for six months after donating a kidney. some doctors recommend that kidney donors avoid contact sports like football and wrestling  due to the potential for injury to your remaining kidney.

How do you overcome culture shock when studying abroad? What are the symptoms of culture shock?  perhaps you have recently moved to a new city  state or country and are feeling a bit overwhelmed with the culture there. rather than succumbing to your anxiety  write it out. journal how you feel at the moment  what troubled or made you happy that day  as well as if you are missing anyone from your last home.  don t allow yourself to become a recluse during this experience. reach out to your friends either locally or at home to talk to them about how you are feeling. perhaps you are on a study abroad trip and have other classmates who have similar feelings  connect with them as well as with those who are adjusting a bit more easily.you might say something like  i know that you seem to be having a great time here in italy but i m really struggling with how different it is from home. how did you manage to acclimate so well      though it can be tempting to allow this culture shock to take over your mind  allow something else to replace it. don t exhaust yourself by ruminating on your stress constantly. watch movies or listen to music that you enjoy. practice your hobbies like reading  dancing or shopping.  being homesick could also be intensifying your feelings of culture shock. though you should not be reaching out 24 7  keep connected with your friends and family back home.plan to call your family and friends at a minimum of every few days. if phone access is restricted where you are  try email or send handwritten letters.    in addition to remaining connected to home  it can also be beneficial to ask for care packages from your loved ones. this will give you a chance to have some reminders of home abroad with you and will provide you comfort during times of stress.you might ask for particular snacks or hygiene products that you like that you cannot find in your current location.    when you are experiencing culture shock  nearly every experience that you are having may feel completely new to you. find some ways to bring some experiences and normalcy from home to your current environment. for instance  perhaps you enjoy a certain meal that you can t find in any restaurants in your current location. find the ingredients and make your own.though you should try to have many new experiences  try to keep some familiarity in your daily schedule.    though this experience may be a bit overwhelming for you  you can combat this through doing a bit of information digging. do some research on the area  country  or town that you are in. having a greater context and understanding will help you to adjust better and have more knowledge of the culture.for instance  perhaps you were accepted into a university that is located in a predominantly native american community and you were not aware of that beforehand. research the local tribe as well as the community s history. you will likely develop a greater appreciation because of it.    find out as much as you can about the culture of the area so that you don t commit any social faux pas. for instance  if you are in israel  you may want to keep your shoulders and thighs covered at all times. you do not want to offend others out of your own ignorance of the customs.  familiarize yourself with the setting that you are in. take some time each day to walk and explore your surroundings. if you are in a safe area  you can go alone or ask a friend to walk with you.keep your phone on you so that you can find your way home should you get lost.    take some time to truly immerse yourself in the language of your location. try to learn at least a few basic terms and phrases that will help you get by during your stay. if you will be in the area an excess of six months  however  you might want to consider learning more. try to learn at least one or two new phrases per day.   try to have conversations with local speakers. watch television shows or movies in the language to learn it more readily.    though you might be missing the food from home  you now have the opportunity to experience an entirely new array of dishes that you might love. try as many of these foods as you can. find a buddy to try them with you and ask the locals for the best spots to visit.  find ways to get more involved in the community that you are in. perhaps you come from a predominantly black community and now find yourself in a town where over 90  of the population is white. try to find a community of people with interests similar to you  while also finding those who you can identify with racially.for instance  perhaps there is a local book club who is scheduled to read a book that you are interested in. join this club and try it out for a while.    once you begin to become a bit more acclimated to the culture  avoid the urge to  go native.  while it is okay to appreciate and participate  avoid the desire to immerse yourself so fully that you forget your own culture. an example would be travelling to india and getting henna tattoos without understanding the deeper meaning of the ink  which is traditionally used in wedding ceremonies.    perhaps during your journey in this new place  you have made a few mistakes. forgive yourself and work to avoid these missteps in the future. consult with locals  your supervisor if you are on a study abroad trip  as well as websites related to the culture there.   for instance  in certain cultures  if you are in someone s home  it is considered rude to turn down food. find out the norms in your area and practice them.    finally  you should set goals for yourself and then plan action items that will help you achieve them. perhaps you have a goal of having a 10 minute conversation in spanish within two months  or making three local friends. whatever your goals  stick to them so that you can adapt more successfully and intentionally.  though culture shock can be stressful  work to find the beauty in your surroundings daily. make a list of all of the good things about your environment as well as any fun experiences that you have had. you have likely had a lot more fun than you might realize  but documenting that on paper can make it feel more real to you.for instance  perhaps the city you are in is gorgeous. you might also have met a really nice friend while you have been there.    another way to find and create more positivity with your experience is to make some local friends. go out at night and meet new people. go to a festival or event and make some connections there. local friends can be instrumental in helping you navigate the area  find the coolest spots  and have the best time where you are.  though you should certainly try to learn more about the culture that you are in  you can also teach others about your own culture. this will help you feel more productive and valued as well as connected to home.perhaps you want to cook your family s favorite meal for your new friends.    times might be tough  but never forget to laugh despite it all. spend time with friends laughing and joking  call your funny friends  get on social media  or watch a funny show or movie.  it is also critical that you take care of yourself during this time. eat well  exercise  keep your space neat  and keep up your own personal hygiene. take some time for yourself each day to relax and decompress.

and sentences that you find difficult or tricky to pronounce.   one modern approach is to use technology. there are apps that can run on smartphones and tablets that listen to what you say and then give you feedback. for example  on android there is the free app  talking english.  you can also find similar apps in the apple app store.    choose some speeches  short stories  or poems from a college english textbook  or any other text you like   and read them aloud. that way  you can concentrate on the sounds and muscle movements involved in each word and not have to worry about coming up with the words yourself.    doing so allows you the chance to review your sessions and track your progress. practicing correct pronunciation  enunciation and diction may sound like a lot of hard work

for you and your listeners. a steady pace is better than speaking in a fast pace  especially if you want to send the intended meaning of your message across.    speech delivery depends on physical body mechanics just as it counts on verbals factors like inflection. if you keep your back bent and hunch your shoulders  you don t allow enough air to exert pressure on your diaphragm or pass through your larynx  voice box . the best public speakers and orators often maintain proper speaking posture  which includes stomach in chest out shoulders relaxed back straight feet steady    the proper standing and sitting posture means that you draw your voice not directly from the larynx  but from the diaphragm. you also relieve pressure on your larynx by relaxing your shoulders  which means that you would talk in your natural pitch. if you keep your feet flat and steady  you also give yourself a very stable vertical base to support your body when you talk.  sometimes  impediments in speech  like stuttering  grow from nerves and anxiety.before you have to speak in front of a group  go through a deep breathing activity to calm your nerves  relax your body  and get you in the right mental state for proper speech.   sit comfortably and with an erect posture. breathe in deeply through your nose. you should use your hand to feel your stomach expanding like a balloon being inflated. hold the breath and then release it slowly  feeling your stomach deflating beneath your hand. repeat this exercise before you have to speak publicly to relieve stress.    another great advantage to proper posture is that you look and feel good whenever you re speaking  whether it s a formal speaking engagement or a chat over lunch. proper posture boosts your confidence  and tells people that you know what you re talking about.    this professional will diagnose your specific speech disorder and discover the causes. then  they will decide which interventions will be most helpful in enabling you to speak correctly. the therapist will determine how much speech therapy you need  and you should regularly attend therapy for the best results. therapists are capable of improving speech impediments in both children and adults.speech therapy is helpful for correcting your impediment. the therapist will point out the part of speech where you re having problems  and will work with you to correct it. private speech therapy sessions do not come cheap  although most insurance policies will fund services needed to treat speech disorders. there s no substitute for learning and practice when it comes to the proper and effective use of language. take every opportunity to speak  to practice and brush up on the correct pronunciation and enunciation provided to you by a professional.    these practitioners can help you overcome your speech impediments if they are caused by emotional distress or learning disabilities. counseling provided by the professional is very useful if you need to break out of your silence and to talk about your problems  your frustrations  or your own personal tragedy. such interventions might help you come to terms with anxiety and learn effective ways of coping that still enable you to speak properly.  if you have misaligned teeth  you may have difficulty pronouncing some words because of a lisp. most malocclusions are corrected through braces. braces pull  push  and adjust individual teeth to correct your bite. the problem with braces is that they often cause a speech impediment  especially when the springs  bands and wires of a set of braces are adjusted every month.every time the dentist adjusts your braces  or even dentures   you need to train yourself to talk and to eat properly. it may be quite painful at first  but remember not to go too far  lest you end up with a mouth injury. most braces are used for orthodontic purposes  although some braces can be used as decorations. braces are rather expensive  and you may need to take out a dental plan or cash in on dental insurance to pay for them. kids and teenagers don t like to wear braces because they re often teased as  metal mouths  or  railroad faces.  the fact is that braces are still the best way to correct a lisp caused by misaligned teeth.    features that present at birth or due to physical injuries may result in medical conditions that limit your ability to speak. many of these physical conditions can be rectified with proper speech and medical treatment.   cleft lips and palates were a major cause of speech impediments until surgery became affordable. now  children born with clefts can have reconstructive surgery and a multidisciplinary team of providers that help with feeding and speech and language development.malocclusion is when the teeth do not have the proper normal bite. malocclusions are usually corrected through braces  although orthodontic surgery is necessary in some cases. individuals with this condition may talk with a lisp  make a whistle sound when certain words are spoken  or mumble.neurological disorders caused by accidents or brain and nerve tumors can cause a speech disorder called dysprosody. dysprosody involves difficulty in expressing the tonal and emotional qualities of speech such as inflection and emphasis.  dyslexia and other learning disabilities can prevent a person from learning how to speak properly. children who suffer from learning disabilities often have speech impediments  although they can be overcome through speech therapy.  people who suffer from traumatic experiences often develop speech problems like stammering and stuttering. a death in the family  a horrible accident  or a crime can often affect the ability of a person to speak clearly.  some speech impediments are permanent  especially when caused by neurological disorders. on the other hand  a speech impediment may be the result of not having been taught how to speak clearly and communicate effectively. if you or your child are not taught proper speech practices at school or at home as a youth  it could lead to a speech impediment. these conditions  however  can generally be overcome.    on the other hand  many people with speech impediments encounter these problems because it runs in their families. in fact  research shows that inherited speech and language impairments are more likely to occur the more individuals in the family are affected. in other words  if both parents and one sibling have a speech disorder  the other sibling has a higher chance of having one as well.
query	88	spinal muscular atrophy reduce
query	89	testosterone increase  ask for a detailed analysis of your weight. if you are overweight or obese  this could be the cause of a drop in testosterone.   obese people secrete more aromatase  an enzyme that works to convert testosterone to estrogen. your metabolism will continue to decrease as your body produces more aromatase  making the problem worse. create a weight loss plan with your doctor.    increased weight and obesity can lead to low testosterone levels.changing your dietary patterns can make a big difference not only to your testosterone levels but to your risk for heart disease and diabetes. start changing your diet by cutting out processed  packaged  and prepared foods.    eating  whole  foods means cutting out excess sugars  trans and hydrogenated fats  preservatives  etc. try to incorporate    more fruits and vegetablesmore fish and quality meat. avoid processed food  including grains  lentils  beans  and dairy. more nuts and seeds    this includes sugars added to processed foods  such as high fructose corn syrup   as well as artificial sweeteners.if you need a  sweet hit   try using stevia  a herb that can provide sixty times the sweetness of sugar.    omega 3 fats are healthy fats found in a variety of foods. these include those found in eggs  algae  fish  and mussels  but also plant oils like flaxseed  hemp and walnut oil. healthy fats actually help to build a healthier body.    lots of water is essential to any healthy diet. in addition to hydrating you  water can also stop you from feeling hungry.    cut down on snacking  eating when bored  and other sneaky calories. try to eat only when you are hungry.    restricting calories significantly may send the wrong signals to your body  which will not increase testosterone. instead  cut your calories by approximately 15 percent the first week.   all weight loss goals should be reasonable. aim to lose a pound per week by improving diet and increasing activity levels.    meat  high protein yogurt  and some vegetables can help build muscle. increasing muscle will help burn fat and increase testosterone.    if you have never lifted weights  used resistance bands or used weight machines  hire a personal trainer or physical therapist to teach you the proper form and procedure.if you are very weak  start with resistance bands. this gentle form of strength training allows you to use a rubber strap to train weak muscles before lifting actual weights.do this 2 to 3 times per week for the first 3 to 4 weeks. if you have a joint or back problem  you may want to graduate to stronger bands and stick to this form of strength training. you can increase your testosterone levels by up to 20 percent by lifting weights 3 times per week for 11 weeks. strength training in the evenings can increase testosterone levels in the evening. these effects tend to be brief and smaller the better shape you are in.they can still help.    for men  you will want to choose weights that tire your muscles after only 5 repetitions. do 3 sets. you should feel muscle fatigue after a weight training workout. allow your muscles 24 to 48 hours to rest.   women or people with joint problems may choose to do endurance training. for example  they may choose a slightly lower weight and complete 3 sets of 10 to 15. work half sets in between full sets. this means you should complete half the range of motion  from the bottom up or top down  to work the fast twitch muscle fibers as well as the slow twitch fibers. lift weights slowly. breathe slowly and never drop the weight. control the weight until it is in its original position.    begin doing cardio exercise for at least 30 minutes 5 times per week.   interval training requires you to warm up  sprint or workout intensely for a short period  such as 90 seconds   and then work out at a more moderate  resting  pace for a slightly longer interval  approximately 2 to 4 minutes . repeat these sets for approximately 30 minutes  including warm up and cool down. the different intervals can vary based on the specific cardio activity. if you are new to interval training  consider having a personal trainer suggest a regimen for your experience level. cardiovascular machines  like stair machines  bikes  ellipticals  and treadmills can be programmed to do interval training if you do not want to jog or swim while providing your own interval timing.    while general activity is good  you will need to work your heart more intensely to reach weight loss and testosterone improvement goals. this is true for both strength training and cardio.   do not overtrain. if you are already fit  too much cardio exercise is likely to lower testosterone levels.your goal is to keep your metabolism high while giving the body plenty of time to rest and recover. drink plenty of water before  during  and after exercise. dehydrated people produce less testosterone after a workout. don t forget the other benefits from exercise  including better cardiovascular health  weight loss  increased strength  and endurance.  intermittent fasting combined with moderate to high intensity exercise has been shown to increase testosterone levels.during the fasting period  include moderate to high intensity exercise of your choice. the idea here is that since you are fasting  your body will turn to stored fat for its fuel.  doctors recommend 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night. less sleep can result in 10  lower testosterone levels. less sleep can also make it difficult to lose weight.  moving around more and sitting less will balance your hormones  decrease stress  and result in weight loss.   buy a pedometer. make sure you hit at least 10 000 steps per day during the course of your daily routine.    stress produces the hormone cortisol and interrupts the production of hormones such as testosterone.focus on creating a work life balance. spend 2 hours a day on leisure activities you enjoy. try to bring your workday down to 10 hours or less.start meditation  deep breathing  yoga  tai chi  and or qigong. these activities can reduce stress and help you sleep better. if you don t think you have time  start by taking four 2 3 minutes throughout the day to take 25 deep breaths per break.    if low testosterone has affected your sex life  then consider changing sexual activity to the morning. testosterone levels are naturally higher in the morning.    getting vitamin d requires you to spend some time  15 to 30 minutes  with a good amount of your skin in direct sunlight. keeping vitamin d levels high can produce up to 20  more testosterone. consider talking to a medical professional about vitamin d supplements if you work inside all day and cannot spend time in the sun.  moderate to mild zinc deficiencies have been shown to lower testosterone levels.talk to a knowledgeable healthcare provider about a zinc supplement.    some studies have shown that certain herbal supplements may help to increase testosterone or combat the effects of low testosterone. some of these herbal supplements include    tribulus terrestris  which has shown an increase in sexual activity in animal studies. follow manufacturer s instructions. withania somnifera  ashwaganda   which has been reported in preliminary clinical trials to increase sperm quality.most studies have used up to 450 mg four times a day. ginkgo biloba  which increases testosterone synthesis.dosage was 270 mg of ginkgo extract 4 times a day. follow manufacturer s instructions. yohimbe  which has been used to increase sexual interest and treat erectile dysfunction.doses vary but ranged from 5.4 mg  3 times a day  to 10.8 mg  3 times a day . follow manufacturer s instructions.    men with low testosterone levels may notice a variety of associated symptoms. these may include    erectile dysfunction  ed   including a decrease in the number and quality of erections smaller testes  hypogonadism  decreased sperm counts a decrease in muscle mass leading to decreased strength and endurance changes in blood lipids such as cholesterol levels osteopenia  softening of the bones  and osteoporosis  decreased bone density  hot flashes swollen or tender breasts  gynecomastia     in addition to physical effects  men may also notice mood changes associated with low testosterone. these can include    decreased sex drive  libido  fatigue mood changes  including depression  irritability  and anxiety problems with memory  concentration  or a sudden lack of self confidence    diagnosis involves a blood test along with a physical exam. the test is most often done using blood drawn in the morning. this is usually when testosterone levels are highest.   your doctor will diagnose the condition if your combination of symptoms and lab results indicate low testosterone levels.    under most circumstances  adults who have been medically diagnosed with low testosterone levels can safely increase their levels  and natural methods can be some of the healthiest ways to do so. that being said  you should avoid intentionally increasing your testosterone if you are still an adolescent or if you re an adult with normal or undiagnosed levels.   testosterone levels are usually highest during your adolescent years  but since your hormones fluctuate regularly during this time of your life  it s best to let them naturally adjust themselves rather than attempting to change them yourself.if you re concerned about low testosterone as a teenager  consult with your doctor before making any changes. increasing testosterone when your levels are already normal can negatively impact your health  even as an adult. for women  high testosterone may lead to polycystic ovarian syndrome  infertility  obesity  and thinning hair  among other problems.there s some debate regarding how harmful high testosterone can be for men  but some research suggests that excessively high levels can increase a man s risk of cardiovascular disease.  if you have no known health concerns other than low testosterone  most herbal supplements should be relatively safe to try on a short term basis. certain medical conditions may make these herbal remedies dangerous  however  so you may wish to avoid using herbs to increase testosterone if you have known health concerns.   for women  avoid most herbal supplements if you are  or might be  pregnant or if you re currently breastfeeding. tribulus  ashwagandha  ginkgo  and yohimbe are all considered unsafe under these conditions. for men  tribulus might be linked to prostate problems.ashwagandha may cause problems in people with diabetes  low blood pressure  stomach ulcers  auto immune diseases  and thyroid disorders.ginkgo may cause an allergic reaction if you re allergic to urushiols  like poison ivy and cashews. it could also cause problems if you have blood pressure irregularities  diabetes  hypoglycemia  gastro intestinal disorders  musculoskeletal disorders  nervous system disorders  seizures  skin disorders  psychiatric disorders  or heart disease.yohimbe is dangerous if you suffer from bleeding conditions  schizophrenia  prostate problems  ptsd  liver disease  kidney disease  blood pressure irregularities  heart disease  anxiety  depression  or diabetes.  if you re not currently on any medications  most herbal remedies are likely safe to use. you may need to avoid these remedies if you re currently on medications that could interact with them  however.   avoid tribulus if you re on blood pressure medication  diabetes medications  or steroids.ashwagandha may be dangerous if you re on immunosuppressants or sedative medications.ginkgo could negatively interact with heart disease agents  seizure medications  anticholinergic agents  antidepressants  and cyp450 metabolized agents.avoid yohimbe if you take or may take maois  clonidine  guanabenz  tricyclic antidepressants  antihypertensive drugs  naloxone  phenothiazines  or stimulant drugs.  as long as you do not have conditions or medications that may cause complications  testosterone herbal remedies are likely safe for adults when taken for six months or less.   beyond six months  some herbal remedies may result in complications like excessive bleeding stomach upset  diarrhea  and vomiting.difficulty sleeping may also be a result.  while moderate amounts of vitamin d and zinc can help your body produce more testosterone and stay healthy  excessive amounts of either nutrient can actually be toxic. it s usually best to get both nutrients from natural sources  but if you choose to take supplemental forms  simply make sure you follow the dosing instructions provided on the label.   the recommended dietary allowance of vitamin d is 600 iu  international units  daily. toxicity usually occurs in people who regularly take around 50 000 iu for several months  but this amount may be smaller for individuals with liver problems  kidney problems  or other health concerns.for zinc  the recommended daily allowance is between 8 and 11 mg daily in adults.the upper limit is about 40 mg daily  and toxicity typically occurs when individuals regularly intake more than this upper limit.  making healthier diet and exercise choices can be a great idea  even if you don t need to increase your testosterone levels. to get the most benefit out of your improved lifestyle while minimizing any possible risks  see your doctor before implementing any major changes.   in addition to testing your testosterone levels and notifying you of any personal health limitations  your doctor can work with you to determine the best treatment possible. your doctor may suggest medical remedies  but don t be afraid to let your doctor know if you strongly wish to stick with natural methods. as long as it doesn t present a threat to your health  most doctors will be willing to work out a strategy according to your wishes.

Is a thyroid problem serious? Does thyroid affect brain function? How dangerous is hypothyroidism?  thyroid hormone is a derivative of the amino acid tyrosine. it has iodine atoms attached to it. therefore  its biosynthesis requires iodide ions that must be supplied in the diet in the form of tablets. otherwise goiter can result in individuals that are deprived of iodine in their diet. in the united states usually table salt is supported with a supplementary amount of iodine to ensure healthy function of the thyroid gland.    there are two types of thyroid hormones that are obtained from each other by biochemical conversions. these are called  thyroxine and tri iodo thyronine. in thyroxine there are four iodide atoms attached to the hormone while in tri iodo thyronine there are only three iodide atoms. most of the thyroxine hormone in the cells is converted to tri iodo thyronine in a biochemical process which involves the removal of one iodine atom from thyroxine. therefore  the most dominant form of the thyroid hormone is tri iodo thyronine.    both of these forms of the thyroid hormone are lipid soluble. therefore  they can penetrate the phospholipid bilayer of the cellular membrane readily. their receptors are located inside the nucleus and they exert their effect by increasing the rate of proteins translation or the synthesis of proteins in the cell.    thyroid hormone secretion is under a positive feedback control from the thyroid stimulating hormone  tsh  of the pituitary gland. namely  high concentration of tsh stimulates high secretion of thyroid hormone and low level of thyroid stimulating hormone leads to low secretion of thyroid hormone.    usually in states of hyperthyroidism in which there is excessive secretion of the thyroid hormone  there is in the blood little of the thyroid stimulating hormone. also in the case of hypothyroidism in which there is deficient secretion of the thyroid hormone to the blood circulation elevated level of tsh are observed in the blood of affected individuals. both of these effects that are observed in hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are direct result to the negative feedback control of the thyroid hormone on tsh or thyroid stimulating hormone.    thyroid hormone unlike other hormones in the body does not have a specific target organ to act upon. instead it acts in a universal manner in which its effect is done on all the cells of the body. its action increases all aspects of metabolism inside the body. in this sense  it has similarity to the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine as far as the increase in metabolic rate in the body is concerned.    thyroid hormone increases all aspects of sugar metabolism including the uptake of glucose by cells in the liver and it increases th rate at which glucose is synthesized by the process of gluconeogenesis. also the thyroid hormone increases the rate at which compounds are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.   nan  lipids  under the effect of the thyroid hormone are promptly mobilized from fats tissue and are readily metabolized in the liver. the thyroid hormone decreases the level of cholesterol in the blood. in addition  it decreases the level of the phospholipids also.    this is so due to the increased activity of enzymes in the body by the effect of the thyroid hormone. for example  the increase in glucose metabolism in the body due to the effect of thyroid hormone renders a need for more of the hormone insulin to speed up the uptake of glucose by the liver cells.

another urinalysis to determine if the treatment is working.if your cat appears unresponsive to treatment  your vet may run additional tests to try to identify other causes of the urinary incontinence.    if your cat is diagnosed with obstructions in their bladder  such as bladder stones  your vet may recommend surgery to remove them. the surgery can be invasive and expensive  but it will effectively relieve your cat s pain and discomfort.the surgery to remove bladder stones is called a cystotomy. it is performed by making an incision through your cat s belly and removing the stones from your cat s bladder. keep in mind cats who develop bladder stones have a high risk of getting them again. your vet may recommend medication or changes to your cat s diet to prevent the bladder stones from coming back.    if your cat s urinary incontinence is due to damage to their urinary tract  your vet may suggest surgery to repair your cat s urinary tract. though the surgery may be costly  it may be necessary if your cat s urinary tract is damaged.  your cat may need some tender loving care after their surgery to ensure they recover well. you should limit your cat s activity so they can heal. keep your cat indoors  such as in a crate or a small room in your home.you may also avoid giving your cat a bath so the incision area does not get wet. try to examine the incision

query	94	adidas wear  before wearing your superstar shoes  treat them with a water and stain repellent. spray the repellant evenly on the area of your shoe. dab the excess repellant with a soft towel  and allow it to dry overnight. when the repellant dries  add a second coat. this should help prevent moisture and most minor stains from damaging your shoes.you can buy water and stain repellant at your local shoe store. re apply the repellant every few weeks as you would with winter boots.    try to avoid getting your shoes dirty. keep them away from dirt and mud. don t run through grass. grass stains can be very difficult to remove. take extra precautions when you re eating so that you don t spill food or liquid on your shoes.   the best way to keep your shoes white is to keep them from getting discolored in the first place.    inevitably  you will get some dirt on your shoes. periodically  bang the soles of your shoes together to loosen dirt particles from them. if you allow the dirt to penetrate the fabric  it will be harder to remove.   only knock your shoes together at the soles. if you knock your shoes together anywhere else  you will scuff them up. don t hit your shoes together too hard or you might damage them.  when you get a stain on a rubber part of one of your shoes  immediately use a magic marker to clean it. dampen your magic marker and wring out the excess water. rub it gently over the stain. use your magic marker to spot clean the shell toe and the sole of each of each of your shoes.   be careful not to smear the stain.    if you notice a scratch or blemish on the fabric part of one of your shoes  promptly wipe it away with a shoe cleaner wipe. wipe your shoes in a gentle circular motion.   wipe your shoes softly to avoid scratching them. you can substitute baby wipes if you don t have any shoe cleaner wipes available.    take your shoelaces out of your shoes. fill your sink up about halfway with water. take some hand soap and work it into each of your laces. be thorough  loosen all the dirt you can. drop the laces into the water and wash away the remaining soap. rap a dry rag firmly around one lace. pull the rag along the length of the lace to dry it and repeat the process to dry the other lace.you can also throw your laces in the washer. be sure to put them in a pillow case first and wash them in a normal cold wash cycle. your old laces will start to unravel after a few washes so you should still buy new laces periodically. new laces can instantly make your shoes appear brighter. you can also use an iron to dry your laces and straighten them.    pour a few drops of dish soap into a small glass of water. let the mixture sit for a few minutes. never use more than a teaspoon of dish soap in your mixture.never use bleach to clean your shoes. bleach will turn your white shoes yellow.    apply your mixture to a shoe cleaner brush and rub it onto your shoes in a circular motion. work the mixture in until it starts to foam. you can use a toothbrush to clean the soft fabric and hard to reach parts of your shoes.   be gentle  don t rub your shoes too hard or you may scratch them. only use soft bristle brushes to clean your shoes. a hard bristle could damage them.  gently wipe off the foam from your shoes with a soft clean cloth. put some dryer sheets on the inside of your shoes to soak up the remaining moisture. give your shoes some time to dry naturally. it could take them as long as a day to dry completely. change the dryer sheets every few hours to speed up the process.   don t use a hairdryer or any other source of heat to dry your shoes. excessive heat can damage them. the dryer sheets will also remove odor from your shoes to keep them smelling fresh.    make sure your shoes are completely dry before you store them. it will be easier for dirt to stick to your shoes if they are wet. moisture can also weaken the fibers in shoes causing them to become weaker and lose their shape.    if you leave them out  people might step on them or even spill things on them. keep them in their shoebox until you are ready to wear them.   if you don t have the box your shoes came in  you can place them on a shoe rack that is away from people.    make sure you store your shoes in a cool place. heat can cause discoloration in white shoes. if you have a shoe closet  keep your white shoes as far away from the light bulb as you can.  too much sunlight can cause your shoes to become yellow. if you plan on wearing them outside  a little sun is unavoidable  but never leave your shoes out in the sun.   if you have to take your shoes off to go swimming  rent a locker to protect them. at the very least  leave them under a chair or table. if you know you ll be at an outside event all day  it may be wise to wear a different pair of shoes.

query	123	abraham lincoln work lawyer  lincoln may have had a lot of folk sense in him  but he never turned down an opportunity to look civilized and classy. his dress of choice was always a black overcoat. so long as the coat doesn t have any visible logos or symbols  you can use any black overcoat for this.look at existing lincoln costumes or pictures of the man himself and decide if any coat you have fits the bill.   a grey vest underneath may help to round off your costume.however  if you can t find one of those  a white dress shirt will do. you may also choose to button up your overcoat.    top hats can be found at costume or consignment stores  or made by rolling black felt and gluing on a rim. provided you re aiming for a traditional lincoln costume  you should keep the hat black. top hats often come with pre fabricated lincoln costumes.if you can t find a top hat  make your own. roll black construction paper into a tube. stand it up on another sheet of black construction paper  and trace the circle around the bottom  use a pencil so the silvery graphite will show up . fold the paper in half so that the circle is exactly in half  cut out the circle  and cut a second circle out around the edge  so that you end up with a brim for your top hat. tape it to the black tube.    although they won t attract as much attention as your coat or top hat  it s nonetheless a good idea to round off your costume with a good set of black shoes. the most important thing is that your shoes are black  this way they won t conflict with the rest of the costume. shoes with a buckle are rarer today than they were then  but they also match the costume if you have them lying around.   lincoln wore size 14 shoes. lincoln s father was a shoemaker.  they are not commonly worn in fashion today but you can usually find them for sale at department stores and costume shops. bowties don t need to be done up perfectly. rather  an imperfect bowtie will give your costume that much more character. lincolns bowties were obviously hand tied  but pre tied bowties are available as well if you don t want to bother with the tying process.to hand tie a bowtie  loop the bowtie around your neck  leaving a few inches more on one side. draw the longer end under the other side of your tie and loop it through the center  tightening it as you go along. bring the longer end of the bowtie over the other end and pinch them in the middle  looping the longer end through a hole at the back. tighten it gently.  lincoln s beard was arguably his most distinctive attribute. his beard was based around the chin and allowed to grow quite bushy  without hiding his shirt collar.look at pictures of lincoln s beard and groom your facial hair to match this. you can also make a fake beard with construction paper or brown felt. use spirit gum to attach it to your face.   although he s remembered for his beard  there were points in his life where abraham lincoln shaved his beard. a woman named grace bedell convinced him to grow it out. this had the effect of making lincoln look more trustworthy and warm.  eyebrows are a distinctive trait of lincoln s.although not quite as iconic as the beard  they should be considered if you want to make a convincing lincoln costume. either purchase some fake eyebrows from a costume store  or make some of your own by gluing pipe cleaner onto thin strips of brown construction paper. from there  you can glue them to your face using spirit gum.    lincoln had a very striking face  with sunken cheeks and protruding cheekbones. one way to replicate this look is by using stage makeup. you should first suck n your cheeks. this way  you ll be able to see where the contours of your face are. next  take a grey or brown stage makeup and apply it to the area that s sucked in. blend the edges with your fingers.   because  gaunt cheek  makeup is usually reserved for horror costumes  it s a good idea to be very moderate with the makeup you use here  provided you re going for a  realistic  lincoln.you can try different variations on makeup to create different looks. a  zombie  abe lincoln can be done by using lots of white with black around the eyes.  lincoln was known for preferring to keep his hair unruly  as opposed to smooth. if your hair length is approximately that of lincoln s  you should tousle it up by rubbing your hands coarsely through it. if your hair is quite long  you can get some of the same untidy impression by trapping all of your hair under your top hat and letting a few strands hang loose.    there are endless creative ways you can spruce up a costume once you have the basics down. because abraham lincoln was a politician  you might consider making a pin that says  vote abraham lincoln  on it and pinning it to your jacket. the real lincoln was also often seen holding pocket watches  so adding one to your costume may be a good idea for the fake of authenticity.   a walking cane is always a good add on to a costume of this nature.    a good costume maker won t be limited to the most obvious costume solutions. in truth  there s a virtually endless amount of ways you can make yourself look like lincoln  without even wearing the proper clothes for it. for instance  you could use paper and black spray painted cardboard cutouts to make the costume s  coat  and  hat   then tie the pieces around your body. this approach can be called the  paper raham lincoln  costume.   don t underestimate the effect of multiple layers in a fake materials based costume. for instance a  dress shirt  underneath the cardboard coat could be made by cutting out some of the cardboard in the middle and gluing white construction paper    this often takes the form of combining the costume with a skirt and heels in order to feminize it. the  babe raham  lincoln costume is a well known example of this. you can exchange the big coat and pants for a black skirt and blouse. the only part of the original costume you should keep is the hat and chin beard.   the baba raham lincoln costume is a spoof of  sexy  versions of halloween costumes. it can be worn by men and women alike.    because there are countless things you can do with a costume  don t be afraid to splice your abe lincoln design with other costumes. for instance  a cute cat costume can be merged with a lincoln costume by taking the whiskers and ears  and throwing them together with the chin beard and top hat. if you have a stockpile of costume materials  you should experiment with different combinations using what you already have.   you get bonus points if you re able to make abraham lincoln pun from the combination you ve created.    lincoln was no pushover  but all of his recorded speeches make him out to be a very down to earth  respectable and noble minded speaker. if you want to be a great abraham lincoln  you should act with nobility no matter where you are. keep your volume levelled  and don t speak out of turn. however  when you do speak  you should do so with force and conviction. this manner of speaking is a good part    if you want to go the extra mile  try to nail his likely accent. compared to modern accents  lincoln might be pegged somewhere between a kentucky and indiana accent.look up examples of these accents and pick up on the ways in which particular sounds are inflected. contrary to what you d think  many accounts state that lincoln had a soft  light voice   like a bird .   actors have tried to replicate lincoln s way of speaking. look at a reading of lincoln s speech and get a hang for the way an actor will inflect his voice.  although no recordings of lincoln s speech exist  historians have done research and concluded that lincoln s voice was considerably higher pitched than the usual baritone we hear from politicians.his voice was however not shrill or silly sounding. if you have a naturally deep voice  try to sound a bit higher than you normally would.   edison s first recordings of human speech occurred 12 years after lincoln s death. this makes it anyone s guess what he really sounded like.  steven spielberg s 2012 lincoln biopic has been acclaimed for its historical accuracy.in particular  a lot of attention has been given to how true daniel day lewis  performance is to everything we know of the man. if you want to get lincoln s inflections and personality down  you should watch the film and try to emulate the actor on screen. take care to note the way lincoln talks  as well as the manner in which he moves.   if you were still stumped on certain aspects of your costume you should look at the way the film s costume crew approached lincoln s look.

What does the Bible say about repetitive prayer? What does the Bible say about who to pray to? What does the Bible say about praying in private? What does the Bible say about who to pray to? What is the definition of a prayer warrior?  this prayer is directed toward god  however  jesus in john 10 30 says  i and my father are one . the lord s prayer is found in matthew 5 7. these passages also contain the sermon on the mount and beatitudes  blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted . the sermon on the mount is about the importance of god s place in the inner life as opposed to doing religion for appearances.   jesus condemns the religious officials who have been showing off their righteousness in public. jesus says true righteousness belongs to those who are the lowest  those who mourn  those who are poor  those who are meek  even though they do not give the appearance of righteousness. for example  jesus says in matthew 6 5  whenever you pray  do not be like the hypocrites  because they love to pray while standing in synagogues and on street corners so that people can see them.     this is one of jesus  instructions in matthew 6 6 on how to pray. jesus goes on to say   and your father  who sees in secret  will reward you.  find a room or a private space where you can be alone  and pray to god there. feel comforted by the presence of god  who sees in secret.    this is not the only place you can pray. you can also  pray without ceasing   wherever you may be you can be prayerful  as paul writes in 1 thessalonians. paul also described speaking in tongues as a good way to pray he said   i thank god that i speak in tongues more than you all  1 corinthians 14 18  see also 1 corinthians 14 2 4 5  and14 15     jesus in matthew 6 7 says  when you pray  do not babble repetitiously like the gentiles  because they think that that by their many words they will be heard.  during this time people may have been praying using certain rituals  recitations  and incantations  but you do not need these to pray to jesus.   additionally  you do not need to talk about your problems when you recite the lord s prayer. when you pray in general  or at a different time  you can talk to jesus about your problems. jesus follows up the previous verse with this warning in verse 8   do not be like them  for your father knows what you need before you ask him.     you can read the lord s prayer out loud or to yourself. read it slowly so that the meaning of each verse can sink in. jesus said in matthew 6 9 13  pray  then in this way  our father who is in heaven  hallowed be your name. your kingdom come. your will be done  on earth as it is in heaven. give us this day our daily bread. and forgive us our debts  as we also have forgiven our debtors. and do not lead us into temptation  but deliver us from evil.  our father who is in heaven  hallowed be your name  helps you direct your attention to god who is beyond your ability to see or comprehend.  your kingdom come  your will be done on earth  as it is in heaven  helps you form an attitude of willingness toward taking part in what is being done on earth and engaging with the world around you.  give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors  means that you rely on the goodness of god to provide for you the things you need. you also let go of the things that needy people owe to you  thus you should not demand to receive payment. not forgiving debts of the poor displeases god  for you were forgiven a debt of sin you could never pay.  lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil  could mean different things for different people. not everyone shares the same things they do that they wish they would not do. however  whatever things you struggle with  ask for god s help to overcome those things.  for yours is the kingdom and power and glory forever  is not found in early manuscripts  however  it can give closure to your prayer and refocus you on the awe inspiring nature of god.    you can use your prayers to jesus to tell him about the difficult things that are going on in your life. praying can be helpful for coping with emotions like frustration and pain. if you can let out your anger during prayer rather than in daily life or in your relationships  then it can become an emotional support that you can use to calm you down.when something bad happens to you  for example  you lose your job  you can pray to jesus to help process your emotions and find relief from your stress. give your words of frustration  anger or fear over this loss to him. you can use the psalms as guides in how to pray through hard times. for example  in psalm 4 the psalmist asks that god to give him relief for his distress.   remember that god made you in his image  and jesus loves and his spirit accompanies you on your journey. he wanted you to choose to repent  to seek to please god and acknowledge him in all you do  just the way you are  free to choose to follow his plan to be saved. when you are having a hard time loving yourself  remind yourself that jesus came to this earth and died  in part  because of his great love for you. his grace passes all understanding.remember john 15 11 13  these things have i spoken unto you  that my joy might remain in you  and that your joy might be full. this is my commandment    that you love one another  as i have loved you  and greater love hath no man than this  that a man lay down his life for his friends .      in your prayers to jesus you have an opportunity to reconsider why things have happened to you. perhaps when you reconsider your circumstances you will be better able to understand how god could be using something bad in your life for good.for example  although you have lost your job  you have been able to spend a lot more time with your kids. consider the beatitudes. jesus in the sermon on the mount  matthew 5 1 12  says that  blessed are those who mourn  for they will be comforted. blessed are the meek  for they will inherit the earth .    going to jesus in prayer when you are going through a hard moment can help shield you from the negative emotions that you are experiencing. for example  if someone you love is sick or in surgery  you may need to take a moment and refocus on jesus and take comfort in his presence and strength.although you should use jesus as a support  continue to support others and allow other people you are with to support you as well. continue to stay present with your loved ones and share with them the routine  the joy and pain of what they or you are experiencing.    while you pray about the situations in your life  consider the ways jesus would respond.   if you are having difficulty at work with someone who has interrupted your career by receiving the promotion you desired deserved  you can think about jesus like responses to the situation. for example  in luke 6 27  jesus says  but i say to you who hear love your enemies  do good to those who hate you  bless those who curse you  pray for those who abuse you.     find regular times and places where you can take a break  and take time out to pray. look for a quiet place in your building at work where you can go to pray during your breaks  for example. or go into nature to pray  and find a place by a great tree in a park. you can mark off a consistent time in your schedule to go to this place. set a daily alarm to go off in your phone or make a repeating email reminder for yourself. go to the place you do your prayers  and sit there until you are ready to pray.    for instance kneel  fold your arms in front of you  and close your eyes to pray is a suggested posture.try different postures depending on where you are. for example  if you are praying in a park you might cross your legs  and lay your hands on your knees.      don t make demands  instead ask for help from your father for guidance  peace  and comfort. end the prayer  in the name of jesus  when you pray to god through jesus.    pray for your family  your teachers  your government officials  the poor  and yourself. the thumb can represent your family and the close relationships that are your supports. it is the most sturdy finger  and that is why it represents the family. the index finger  as a pointing finger  can be the finger that represents guidance in your life  or it might stand for those who show you the way and help you. for example  this could be bosses  pastors  teachers  mentors  friends  and even those who provide you health care like your doctors and nurses.. the middle finger is the tallest finger on your hand  and it can be used to remind you to pray for the people in power in your country and in the world  government officials  world leaders  politicians  etc. the ring finger is the weakest finger and therefore may remind you to pray for those who are people who are suffering from poverty and any ailments they do not wish to have. the last  smallest finger represents yourself. don t forget to pray for yourself.    for example  pray while looking at a beautiful painting  if you are a visual person. or you can read a book on prayer or write in a journal. don t try to fit yourself into any container of what you think a prayer should be.   perhaps you need to be doing something with your hands while you pray. you can use rosary beads and repeat prayers for each bead  or you can doodle flowers in your notebook as you pray. you can also sing your prayers. singing prayers can be a joyous way to express your feelings in an outward way.

query	137	prince charming become man  prince charming is meant to be an ideal to aspire to  but are you spending too much time focusing on this ideal above real people  spend some time thinking about what you mean when you think of prince charming. ask yourself what qualities he has and why you think this ideal man is so important.if you realize that your ideal man bears a strong resemblance to a fictional character  it might be a good idea to take a break from watching or reading about him.    it s good to have expectations  they can protect you from being hurt or unhappy in a relationship. however  if your expectations for a future partner are extremely detailed or don t bear any resemblance to any person you ve ever met  you might be holding out for an unrealistic ideal.  it s okay to have some things you won t compromise on  but your non negotiables should be major characteristics. holding out for a guy who has a job or has physical chemistry with you is fine. things like hobbies  eye color  or fashion sense should not determine whether or not someone is truly meant for you.  once you have a set of non negotiables  compromise on the rest  plenty of people find true love with someone who is shorter than they expected or who doesn t like the same video games they do. work on imagining yourself with someone who doesn t satisfy every criteria on your list.  some people hide behind fantasies of an ideal partner because they lack confidence. if this describes you  spend some time working on your self confidence.   list your favorite things about yourself. if you need help  ask a friend or relative  they know lots of great things about you. exercise and eat fresh foods. you don t have to change your body to feel confident  but moving around and avoiding processed foods can make you feel good about your life choices. do something you re good at. excelling at something can raise your confidence.    spending all your time waiting for your perfect man can scare off potential partners. a good way to stop pining for prince charming is to get into a new hobby. try something that requires you to meet other people  like a local sports league or online gaming.    new interests are a great start to getting out of your comfort zone  but it s important to practice this skill whenever possible. try things wearing brighter colors  visiting a new store  or ordering new foods every day. when you re thinking about how to challenge yourself  you aren t thinking about prince charming  and you might be putting yourself in a position to meet someone great for you   don t pin your hopes for the future on a handsome man rescuing you from all your problems. if you don t have any plans for your life beyond meeting the perfect man  you are actually making it harder to find someone. very few people want to be with someone who has no interests or ambitions outside of romance. think seriously about your career  financial  and educational goals  and work towards them as much as you can.  don t sit around waiting for your perfect man to introduce himself. if you see someone who looks interesting  walk up to them and start talking  it s best to keep it observational at first  talk about the weather  the music playing  or compliment their clothing.    if you re holding out for prince charming  it can be hard to resist ignoring everybody who doesn t fit your list. try your best not to do this  when you look at prospective dates  think about what they do have to offer instead of all the ways they don t meet your requirements.  when you re meeting someone new  focus on whether or not they have chemistry with you. do you feel excited to talk to them  are you interested in hearing what they have to say  would you be sad if you never saw them again  these questions are much more important than figuring out whether or not they are just like your prince charming.  if someone asks you out and they aren t your ideal partner  you shouldn t necessarily reject them immediately. if you have a rapport with them or enjoy being around them  give them a chance this doesn t mean you should go out with anyone who asks. if you don t like someone  you shouldn t date them.

How wealthy is Greece? How did Greece become a country? Is Greece developed?  greece as an empire was active some time before the roman empire starting around 800bce and continued until the romans conquered it.   before 800bce is a period often referred to as the greek dark ages and the subsequent era is often called the archaic era. this was where the great cities  philosophies and sciences  theatre  classical art  law and the greek language being written down were starting to set seed. this era had many rulers known as tyrants   a word we still use today   whose gradual overthrow paved the way towards greek democracy and the athenian model of government. this era artistically had influences from egypt and what we call today as the middle east and is often called the orientalization of greece. after the last tyrant overthrow in 510 bce  this heralded the start of the classical period that is perhaps the most famous. its bedrock moment arrived because of the athenians successfully defending greece from a persian invasion and this period continues to the hellenistic civilisation starting in 323bce. this era is where the empire becomes dominant with alexander the great rising to power and expanding the empire through to india where he eventually turned back. this era ends with his death in 323bce  which leads to the hellenistic era. the hellenistic era focuses more on maintaining the empire but ends in 146bce when the divided greek empire falls under roman conquest and becomes part of the roman empire.    ancient greece had a clear social structure but was more flexible in some areas.   greece in many ways was more democratic than its ancient neighbour rome as social status did not give additional rights. democracy itself is a greek word. there was four main social classes in athens  yet if one earned more money and chattels they themselves could climb the social ladder. education was an important factor for climbing the social ladder as most rights were awarded once the education was completed  but education was an expensive and private engagement with the family employing a tutor. only sparta seems to have had publicly funded and obligatory education. slavery was common in greece  however there were differences between greece and rome. the greeks generally treated slaves far better than the romans with beating and killing them as forbidden and many slaves were offered their freedom as an agreement to work better. the population of slaves however varies by accounts of being the majority of the populace  but it is still clear they were a significant part of the population and many held roles in public service. unlike the romans  slaves were not accorded the rights of citizen after freedom and they were part of their own social group known as a  metic . in sparta however  things were far harsher for slaves and a group of slaves from conquered armies were often killed in a rite of passage for spartans. serving in the army was often compulsory for men  as it was not only a way to maintain and defend the empire  but also to give skills in engineering and management.    before christianity became mainstream in 529 ad  greek religion was pantheistic and included worship of heroes as an important factor.   one of the central dynamics of the religion focused on the epic conflict between the gods on mt olympus and the titans. the gods   titans feature within the same creation myth but were divided between them and frequently at war. the gods and goddesses are biographical and personalised than roman gods and these deities and legends had a complex relationship between themselves and humans. the cult like worship of heroes such as heracles  also known as hercules   perseus  achilles and their stories was important to greek society as they served as role models and sources of national pride. the  anti hero  was also important  which is not the villain of the story  but are bland or non heroic characters that are least likely to be heroes but become or act heroically. indian and other religions were also known to the ancient greeks  with one king who is commonly referred to menander i soter  or melinda in the indo greek world   who had embraced buddhism and reigned around 150bce ruling a significant eastern part of the empire. this region had influenced greek architecture  which in turn strongly influenced the roman models  yet heading the other way  the influence spread as far as japan. the greeks also set great store in oracles and prophecies  such as the famous oracle of delphi. oracles would often fall into a trance and priests for those who had paid for the prophecy translated their expressions. after the roman conquest  many of the greek gods with synthesized were roman equivalents within rome  this functioned in a way so a roman citizen could worship in greece but the synthesis also boosted the power of the roman gods. most of the planets  excepting earth  mars  and venus were named after greek gods   goddesses  visit know the twelve olympians of greek mythology to get some more background information on the heroes of greece.    these two fields were often part of the same school  where today philosophy is a separate field and occasionally not seen as a science at all.   learn about some of the famous greek philosophers and scientists such as thales  socrates  plato  aristotle  epicures  pythagoras  zeno  euclid  archimedes and more. early philosophers were more interested in science rather than wisdom  but in the classical period  wisdom  ethics  good governance and other virtues became equally important. greece was often at war with various nations within greece  such as athens and sparta   but also outside of greece with the persian world and other nations so philosophy was an important science. the greek language has contributed much to our modern language as many of our modern names for sciences come from ancient greece. some examples are physics  philosophy  astronomy  geography  mathematics  and cartography. other interesting technologies and inventions include   cranes for lifting  road building  the antikythera   reckoned to be a complex astronomical calendar  calipers  astrolabes  lighthouses  showers  waterwheels and many more including steam and water powered machinery. visit for how to live like socrates  argue using the socratic method  do the philosophy of happiness  diogenes  epicurus    understand stoicism for more ideas and insights about greek philosophy.    the greeks loved music  dance  poetry and theatre with tragic and comedic plays as well as the epics such as the odyssey and the illiad  as well as stories of the battles between athens  troy  sparta and other nations which are classics still told today.   theatre really came into its own during the classical period  after much of athens was destroyed by persian invasions. this revival and rebuilding led a great re invention and revival of greek literature and the word thespian has its origins in greece. the greeks attended plays in vast audiences  as it was a major source of entertainment. masks were a key costume part of greek theatre and some even had brass instruments fitted to act as a megaphone to amplify actors voices. the famous duo of the two masks of comedy and tragedy as a symbol of the theatre has their roots in greek theatre. some of the most famous plays and playwrights were sophocles  who counted among his works the story of oedipus  aristophanes who had many comedies but who also wrote  the clouds  a fictional spoof based on socrates  which was later used to falsely implicate the philosopher as being immoral and consequently executed by drinking hemlock poison. music in classic greece traditionally was an expression of philosophy  as a metaphor of the harmonics of the universe with everything vibrating in harmony. it was also an expression of ethos  with certain pieces played at certain times according to their inherent qualities. later music became more of an entertainment. ancient greek music was arguably more varied than modern music as while we have tones and half tones  greek tones went to quarter and even finer subtleties to be able to make perfect balance. greek instruments include string  wind and percussion instruments  including pan pipes  named after the greek god pan   lyres and harps as well as a complex zither like instrument known as a kithara  drums  trumpets  conch shells and a hydraulic organ known as a hydraulis  these instruments later became absorbed into ancient roman music. visit write an epic poem to learn how to create your own epic adventure in the greek style     greece had essentially a mediterranean diet  but it was not entirely as varied or rich as the modern cuisine of greece. ancient greek cuisine was frugal and austere  a major influence was the city of sparta  which even today gives us the word spartan. the ancient greeks loved their wine and a frequent way for men to pass the time was in a symposium  which was basically an evening of a few men  apart from female courtesans and entertainers  women were typically forbidden from the event . the meal as it was would feature snacks such as nuts  grains and pulses as well as honey cakes to be able to prolong drinking. like the romans  great feasts were reserved more for religious grounds and the wealthy  but they were still more austere than later roman empire extravagances. bread was a staple ingredient  mostly made from wheat or barley that was ground into a paste or dried to a flour. leavened bread from yeast and other raising agents were used but later reserved for feast days only and bakery produced bread was expensive  so most food was produced from scratch in homes. vegetables typically featured vegetables such as cabbage  onions  garlic  pulses such as peas  chickpeas   garbanzo beans  and broad beans  as well as lentils. the poor often had their meals were including acorns  bitter vetch and wild herbs. fruits included figs  pomegranates  raisins and if available fresh grapes. olives were an important ingredient as the plant would survive the hot  dry climate and the infertile  alkali soils of the region. this provided olive oil as well as olives for pickling. beverages typically included water  which the greeks valued as a nutritious  life giving drink and like a wine expert today can characterise and even judge its source  so too could the water experts of the time. wine was a common beverage  typically cut with water as it was thought unmixed could be fatal or induce madness. milk was not commonly drunk  although it likely was due to the poor keeping qualities in the climate  as milk was reserved for cheese. meat was very important to the greek diet  as fresh produce was often hard to grow and did not travel well  if the poor had access to land  they would typically raise geese and chickens  but also hunted for game such as hare and game birds. sausages were consumed across the classes  but the cost of a piglet in the cities from a butcher was about the cost of 3 days wages. cooked and salted meats were more common as fresh meat often required a religious ceremony where the fat and bones were cremated to honour the gods. learn how to pickle olives  make greek bean soup and make greek whole grain olive bread for some ideas     greek clothing was typically home made and while in movies is often portrayed as an all white wardrobe  greek fabrics were often vibrantly coloured and patterned. no complete traditional costume has ever survived to modern times so much of what we know comes from artworks and mentions in ancient literature.   clothing was typically made of wool and linen  often imported from egypt and other countries in the greek empire. both men and women wore a costume known as a chiton  which was a large rectangular piece of fabric often from the shoulder height to the floor of the wearer. men often wore them to their knee height while women wore them to ankle length. excess fabric resembled as a loose tunic. it was pulled and secured with a belt or clasp  below the breast or waist of the wearer. the fabric was occasionally pleated to be more decorative. men and soldiers often owned and used a cloak made from wool that was about the size of a blanket and often served as bedding at the same time. it was usually hemmed with a border to protect it from fraying as well as adding a decorative edge. the himation was a winter garment worn both genders over their chitons although sometimes it was worn instead of a chiton. it was similar to in appearance  but not as large as a roman toga. women often wore veils and shawls  both because modesty was an important virtue  but also to protect them during travel and public events from the harsh sun and climate.    you can learn from online sources  documentaries  visiting museums as well as from history experts to gain an insight into an empire  culture and its people whose effects can still be felt today within the modern world.

cleaned easily  a leak proof fuel container  lightweight pots  pans and cutlery. favorite food items.    good food is essential part of the trekking and here good food does not refer to costly delicacies but wholesome and nutritious diet. choice of food is limited once you leave the town and head for wilderness. in many villages there are no food outlets and the trekkers have to be on their own for food. one should drink boiled water or tea mostly to avoid dehydration. however freshly cooked food has no substitute as tinned food losses its taste after some time. trekkers should carry dry fruits  chocolates  sweets  soup packets  coffee powder  a biscuit  butter cheese  noodles etc.    as the himalayan rescue association likes to point out   the himalaya starts where other mountains leave off.  remember it is the sleeping altitude that is critical. if you ascend to an area of high altitude  you are likely to experience some form of altitude sickness. usually  the symptoms are mild and will improve if you descend. what counts as high altitude   high altitude refers to heights that are between 1 500 and 3 500m above sea level. very high altitude is from 3 500 to 5 500m above sea level. extreme altitude is from 5 500 to 7 500m above sea level. the way to prevent altitude sickness is to give the body enough time to get used to the rarefied air. a slow and steady ascent is vital. adequate hydration is also helpful. the body is constantly losing fluid from the lungs and the skin in the high  dry environment. drink enough to maintain a clear and abundant urine output. other measures include eating a high carbohydrate diet  climbing high during the day and coming lower down to sleep  and to mild to moderate activity during the rather than just lie around. almost all altitude problems can be avoided if symptoms are recognized and acted upon. the warning signs are headache  lack of appetite  nausea  feeling of tiredness  and sometimes vomiting. this stage of mild mountain sickness can be treated with aspirin or diamox for headache and something mild for the nausea and vomiting.    always ask your doctor for advice and read the patient information that comes with your medicine.

known as the castle. it is abbreviated as  r  in notation and starts on a1  h1  a8  h8. those are the corners in the rank and file system.    how do they move  rooks may move any number of vacant squares vertically or horizontally. if an opponent s piece blocks the path  that piece may be captured by moving the rook into the occupied square. pieces cannot be jumped  except when castling . if your piece is on your rook s path  your rook must stop before it.  castling is a special move  detailed below.    this is the horse piece. in notation  it s referred to as  n    kt  for older texts . technically speaking  it starts on b1  g1  b8  g8.    how do they move  knights are the only pieces that can jump over other pieces. they move in an  l  shaped pattern. that is  two squares horizontally or vertically and then one square perpendicular to that. for example  a knight may move two spaces horizontally and one space vertically  and vice versa. the knight cannot be blocked  and only captures pieces that it lands on. in other words  you can  jump  over all the pieces blocking the knight  and capture a piece as you land.    in notation  they re referred to as  b.  they start on c1  f1  c8  f8.    how do they move  bishops may move any number of vacant squares in any diagonal direction. like rooks  they may capture an opponent s piece within its path. the bishop can only proceed  land  and capture diagonally on the same color squares as it starts on before the game. just like rooks  if your piece is in their path  they must stop before it. if it s your opponent s piece  you may land on that spot  making a capture.    the positions for black and white are mirrored. if you re white  your queen will be on your 4th square from the left. if you re black  she ll be on the 5th spot from your left. this is  technically  d1  d8. d1 is a white square  for the white queen   d8 is a black square  for the black queen .    how do they move  queens can be thought of as the rook and bishop combined    the most powerful piece on the board. queens can move any number of vacant squares diagonally  horizontally  or vertically. attacking with a queen is the same as with rooks and bishops. that is  you take an opponent s piece that lies within its path by moving to that piece s spot.    this piece is notated as  k  and starts on e1  e8.    how do they move  kings can move exactly one space in any direction and can attack any piece except the opponent s king and queen  it cannot go near it or else it would result in check . kings are not offensive pieces. this is the piece you want to protect with the others.    pawns are denoted by the absence of a letter and take up the eight spots in front  forming a shield to your larger pieces.    how do they move  well  they normally only move forward one space. however  the first time it is moved  it may move forward one or two spaces. if another piece is in front of it  the pawn may not move or capture that piece. pawns may only attack a target if the target is one space diagonally forward from the pawn  i.e. up one square and one square to the right or left . there is a special move that is sometimes encountered  called en passant  in passing .  see below .  pawn promotion  detailed below  occurs when your pawn has marched all the way across the board to the 8th  or 1st  rank.    this is not necessary  but makes it easier to visualize moves and talk about moves  especially in chess literature and on websites. also  when your opponent wasn t paying attention and says   where did you go    you can respond with  rook to a4  ra4 .  here s how it works    the files are the columns  they go up and down. from left to right  they are a h. they are based on white s side. the ranks are the rows  they are horizontal. from bottom to top  they are 1 8. all of white s main pieces start at the 1 position  1st rank   black s main pieces start at the 8 position  8th rank . it is an excellent learning habit to notate your game  writing down the square you and your opponent moved to on a sheet of paper. you can only do so if you know your files and ranks.    to win  you need to checkmate your opponent s king. this means to get his king in a position where he will be captured no matter what    he cannot move and no other piece can protect him. checkmate   that is  the end of the game   can happen in three moves or it can happen in 300. most longer games are different.   the secondary goal is to get rid of all your opponent s pieces  thus making checkmate easier . you capture pieces by landing on the square they occupy. this is all going on while you re protecting your own king  obviously.    this is like checkmate lite. that means the on next move you could ve captured him  but he can still flee or another piece can move to defend him. the game isn t won  but it certainly looks like it s in your favor.   when this happens  be sure to verbally say  check.  your opponent must then do one of the following    avoid the check by moving their king to any vacant square not attacked by another piece.  block the check by placing any piece between your piece and their king.  capture your piece that is putting the king in check with any of their pieces  including the king himself .      in other words  you cannot make a move that exposes your king to capture on the next turn. this means you cannot move your king into an area an opponent s piece can move to the next turn. you also cannot unblock your king from attack  that is  move a piece that would expose your king to direct attack.    use the positions described in the first section on a 64 square  8x8 board. if you don t have one  guess what  with wikihow  you can make your own.    the player with white pieces begins the game by moving one piece as described above. turn then passes to black. regardless of the moves  players always take turns. there is no doubling up or skipping.   if this is your first game  choose who gets white by a flip of a coin or  if both players are good sports  whoever is the weaker player. generally speaking  white has a slight advantage.if it s not your first game  the player who lost the previous game should play white.    the captured piece is then removed from the board and does not return for the remainder of the game.   if we re getting serious  a player has to move a piece once he s touched it. if he only wants to adjust it  he must announce  adjust  before he places his hand on the piece.  making a move is compulsory  it is not legal to  pass   even when having to move is detrimental. play continues until a king is checkmated or a draw occurs. draws can occur in five scenarios stalemate  the king is not in check but cannot move anywhere  and there are no other pieces left  insufficient material  the pieces on the board cannot checkmate at all  so no side will win nor lose  threefold repetition  a position has been repeated three times  such as players moving pieces back and forth  fifty move rule  fifty moves have occurred since the last piece capture or pawn move  agreement  players reach a consensus and agree to a draw     apart from a stalemate  checkmate must happen to end the game    where either your king or your opponent s king cannot be rescued. whoever accomplishes checkmate should say  checkmate   to ensure both players are aware the game is over. let s explore the concept of  check  and  checkmate  a bit more    do one of the following to get out of check  your king is only threatened    take the piece threatening your king. you can do this with another piece or take it with your king directly  if the piece is not protected . move your king out of the range of the attacking piece. block the piece threatening your king with another piece.   if you cannot get your king out of check  this is a checkmate and the game ends with your opponent winning. if their king is in checkmate  you ve won.    it is quickest to pair like pieces  bishop for bishop  and so forth. then  the left over pieces will show who has the current disadvantage and by how much.    generally  pieces are the strongest in the center of the board where they command the most real estate.    pawns are strongest together  such as in chains  diagonal lines of pawns . try not to break this formation unless there is a clear  overriding advantage to be had by doing so.  knights are weakest near the edge of the board.  the maximum number of spaces a knight can control is eight. if the knight is next to the edge of the board  the number of spaces is cut in half to four. likewise  if the knight is positioned in the row or column one away from the board edge  the knight s power is reduced to 75  of maximum   it controls six spaces. you may not miss the power of the knight right away but if you move a knight near the edge of the board  you will often find yourself wasting a move to re position the knight closer to the action which is usually near the center of the board.    bishops are strongest on the long diagonals  major diagonals  where they command the most space. it is really not necessary that the bishops be positioned right in the middle of the board where they are absolutely the strongest in terms of the number of spaces controlled.  realize that the bishop s power can be throttled by the opponent placing a protected piece along a diagonal controlled by your bishop. on the other hand  that piece is pinned in that position if the piece it is protecting is of high value.    rooks are most powerful on open files. position rooks on columns that contain none of your pawns. rooks are also most powerful when controlling the 7th rank for white  2nd rank for black   but only if the opposing king is on its starting rank.  queens have the most power when commanding the center of the board. on the other hand  they are in the most danger there as well. it is often good strategy to keep the queen one move away from this position and to not shield or block the queen s might excessively with your own pieces.  kings should always be protected. they are best shielded by lower value pieces.    as deduced from the optimal piece positionings detailed above  pieces near the center of the board are at their most powerful. usually  the game is a fight for control of the center and  when you re in the center  your opponent has far fewer  good  places to choose from. you have power that can expand in either direction    he ll be relegated to the side  constantly putting him on the defensive.   pawns can help with this. while your more powerful pieces are attacking  a pawn or two can maintain control in the center. see  they are useful.    this will likely determine the rest of the game. a weak opening automatically puts you at a disadvantage for the rest of the game. here are a few things to keep in mind    usually  you ll be best off opening with the d or e pawn  4th or 5th . that opens up the center of the board. make only a couple of pawn moves at the start. you want to get your more powerful pieces out as soon as possible. get your knights out and then your bishops. knights range is limited. it often takes several hops to get them into the fray.  bishops  rooks  and queens can swoop the entire length of the board  whereas the lowly pawn must trudge space by space.  sometimes  it is less obvious what effect moving a knight might have  so their attack is often stealthiest.    if your rook is sitting back there in the corner  you are wasting powerful ammo. the beauty of chess is that no one piece can win the game    you need a team of pieces to bombard your opponent s king. so capture each piece  including your opponent s king    this is especially important if you re playing a skilled player. it s pretty easy to thwart one piece  it s possible to thwart two  but it s incredibly hard to get out of a three spot.    yes  it s important to capture pieces. yes  it s important to checkmate your opponent s king. but at the end of the day  if your king is unprotected  you ll get checkmated  the game will be over  and that offense you were running will be entirely useless. so while you re strategizing in the front  remember what s going on in the back    chess is so fun because you have to think about half a dozen things at once. you have to protect your king while your other pieces are planning two moves in advance. you have to predict where your opponent is going to all the while reading what they re doing now and not letting your own get captured. once you get the hang of it  you ll be able to do all of these things at once without batting an eye.    if your opponent made a move  there s a reason why. he s setting something up. he s eying a potential attack. what is he doing  what is he aiming for  try your best to read this so you can circumnavigate his actions and thwart his plan.   same goes for you  you know. maybe you can t capture a pawn on this move  but what move can you make now to set yourself up in your next move  or maybe the move after that  this isn t your normal board game    every move you make now affects the moves you make in the future.    when your opponent makes a move and doesn t take one of your pieces  take a second to scan the board. is he in a position to take one of your pieces  if so  don t allow it  move that piece out of the way or to threaten another piece of your opponent s. or  what s better  capture that threatening piece yourself  never just let a piece go.   unless it s all part of strategy  of course. if you re using a piece as bait to draw your opponent to a specific area of the board  totally let that piece go. as long as you re planning something more devious yourself     did you know you can checkmate your opponent in as little as two moves  there s very specific instructions for a win in two  three  and four moves and  of course  all will leave your opponent scratching his or her head. if you re

checkmate      en passant  from french   in passing   is a special capture made by a pawn. it happens immediately after a player moves a pawn two squares forward from its starting position  and an opposing pawn could have captured it if it had only moved one square forward. in this situation  the opposing pawn may  on the immediately subsequent move  capture the pawn as if taking it  as it passes  through the first square.   the resulting position would then be the same as if the pawn had only moved one square forward and the opposing pawn had captured normally. en passant must be done on the very next turn  or the right to do so is lost.   it is  now or never.      if a pawn reaches the 8th rank  or 1st rank if you are black   or the other side of the board  it can be promoted to a knight  bishop  rook  or queen. it cannot stay as a pawn or be promoted to another king. quite obviously  this is very  very good if you can manage it.   to indicate pawn promotion in chess notation  write the square that it moves to  e.g.  c8 . then you put an equals sign  e.g.  c8  . then put the abbreviation for the piece that you want it to promote it to  e.g.  c8 r .     this is used to get your king out of the center  where it is most vulnerable. to castle  you move your king two squares to the left or right  then your rook jumps from the corner square over the king to the next square. you cannot castle if    there are pieces between the king and rook. the king is in check  or it will have to go through check or into check to castle. the king or rook has already moved in the game. the rook is not on the same rank as the king  prevents castling with a promoted pawn .

query	187	diet coke drink  apply a light coat of cooking spray to the bottom of the pan  then set the pan on the stove over medium high heat.   to keep this recipe as low calorie as possible  consider using a low calorie cooking spray. normal cooking spray will also work  however.    place the chopped onion and minced garlic in the hot pan. stir fry for about 2 minutes  or until the garlic deepens in color and becomes more aromatic.   the onion may also release a stronger scent during this time  but use the garlic as your guide. if you overcook the garlic at this stage  it could ruin the taste of the finished dish.    place the bite sized pieces of chicken and chunks of bell pepper in the pan with the onions and garlic. continue cooking  stirring frequently  for about 5 minutes or until the chicken lightly browns on all sides.   you can use red  yellow  or green bell peppers for this recipe  or opt to use all three. keep in mind that red and yellow peppers tend to be slightly sweeter than green ones.    in a separate bowl  whisk together the tomato paste  tomato passata  or tomato puree   worcestershire sauce  soy sauce  parsley  basil  thyme  and chicken broth stock. pour the diet cola over the mixed ingredients and stir lightly to combine.   note that tomato passata is ideal for this recipe  but it s an ingredient commonly found across the united kingdom and europe and rarely found in the united states. canned tomato puree  u.s. variety  will work as a substitute but for an even better substitute  puree an equivalent can of diced tomatoes in your blender or food processor until smooth.also note that tomato paste in the united states is called tomato puree in the united kingdom.  add the mixed sauce to the other ingredients in the pan. stir well to combine and bring the sauce to a boil.    reduce the heat to medium low and cover the pan. allow the dish to cook at a low simmer for about 15 minutes  stirring it every few minutes to prevent it from burning to the bottom of the pan.    stir the snap peas into the rest of the ingredients in the pan and increase the heat to medium or medium high. allow the dish to continue cooking for about 10 minutes.   leave the pan uncovered and stir the contents every few minutes. note that the sauce should begin a gentle boil. when finished  the chicken should be cooked through and the vegetables should be very tender. the sauce should also become slightly thicker.  transfer the chicken to individual serving dishes and enjoy it while it s still hot. you can serve it alongside rice  pasta  or potato wedges.    meanwhile  prepare a 9 inch by 13 inch  23 cm by 33 cm  baking pan by lining it with nonstick aluminum foil.   if desired  you could lightly coat the bottom of the baking pan with nonstick cooking spray instead of using foil. opt for low calorie cooking spray to cut your calories as much as possible  but note that standard cooking spray can be used if a low calorie alternative is unavailable.    lightly sprinkle both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper  then lay the chicken breasts in the prepared baking dish.   if you aren t sure about how much salt and pepper to use  start by splitting about 1 4 tsp  1.25 ml  of each between all of the chicken breast cuts. salt and pepper should only accent the final flavor of the dish  so you don t need much of either.    arrange the onion slices evenly over the surface of each chicken breast. lay any extra onion around the chicken in the bottom of the pan.   if preferred  you could use chopped onion instead of sliced onion. arrange the onions over the chicken in the same manner. you can omit the onion completely  if desired  but including it will add more dimension to the final flavor of the dish.  in a separate bowl  whisk together the ketchup  worcestershire sauce  and diet cola until well combined and mostly smooth.an easy variation would be to omit the ketchup and worcestershire sauce and use salsa or picante sauce  instead.any heat level should work  from mild to hot  and you can even look for low calorie salsa to reduce the calories of the dish even further.    evenly pour the mixed sauce over the chicken breasts  covering them completely. allow the excess to run off into the bottom of the pan.    place the chicken in the preheated oven and bake until cooked through. depending on the thickness of the chicken breasts  this should take anywhere from 35 to 45 minutes.   leave the baking pan uncovered and turn the chicken breasts after approximately 20 minutes. turning the chicken should help minimize the risk of drying it out. note that you only need to cook the chicken until it is no longer pink inside. cooking it longer than necessary will dry it out. if you choose to use a cooking thermometer  the chicken should reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees fahrenheit  74 degrees celsius .    remove the finished chicken from the oven and transfer the chicken breasts to individual serving plates. some of the sauce should thicken over the surface of the chicken during the cooking process  but you should spoon excess sauce from the pan over each serving before enjoying it.    lightly sprinkle salt and pepper over both sides of each chicken breast.   it s generally best to use small amounts of salt and pepper. start with 1 4 tsp  1.25 ml  each or less  divided amongst the entire 1 lb  450 g  of chicken. while not strictly necessary  you could place a slow cooker liner inside the slow cooker for an easier cleanup. if you are unable to find liners  you could lightly coat the bottom and sides with nonstick cooking spray instead.    lay the seasoned chicken in the bottom of the slow cooker first  followed by the onions and bell peppers. try to keep the layers even.   you can use red  yellow  or green peppers for this recipe  or some combination of the three. alternatively  you can omit the peppers completely if you don t like the taste. you can mix the peppers and onions together  but the chicken should remain as the bottom layer. since the heating element of the slow cooker is located in the bottom  the foods requiring the longest cooking time should be placed at the bottom.    evenly pour the barbecue sauce over the chicken  then evenly poor the diet cola on top of that.   there s no need to mix the two sauce ingredients together before placing them in the slow cooker. if you don t like the taste of barbecue sauce  you could use ketchup instead.the final dish will have a milder flavor.    cover the slow cooker and switch it on. if using the  low  setting  cook the chicken for to 8 hours. if using the  high  setting  cook it for 3 to 4 hours.do not open the lid while the chicken cooks. doing so will release some of the built up heat and may result in an increased cooking time.    remove the chicken from the slow cooker and transfer it to individual serving dishes. the leftover sauce should be fairly thin  but you can still drizzle it over each serving of chicken to add more flavor if desired.

Is the French horn difficult to play? What is the easiest instrument to learn?  as with any instrument  there s a proper way to hold your french horn to get the best sound possible when you play it.   sit up in a chair with your back straight so that you can breathe into the horn without obstruction. put your feet flat on the floor  parallel to each other. hold the horn at a 45 degree angle with the mouthpiece toward your face. cup your hand and place your left thumb on the thumb key. put your left index  middle  and ring fingers on the three keys on top. your left pinkie should be through pinkie ring  and your right hand inside of the bell. now that your fingers are in place  bring the horn up so that the mouthpiece is against your lips.    to blow into the mouthpiece  you have to first learn how to purse your lips. this is called   embouchure.    practice saying   mmmm  with your mouth  slowly adding pressure between your lips. your lips should form a frown. the corners of your mouth should stay in place  almost as if you re puckering your lips.it s a good idea to practice in front of a mirror to make sure you re getting your form right.  without pressing any of the valves  you can use the embouchure technique to blow into the mouthpiece of the horn.   you want to blow into the horn using fast  quick blows.make sure you re not pressing your mouth into the mouthpiece too hard. if your teeth hurt or a ring appears on your lips  you re pressing too hard. you want a relaxed tension against the mouthpiece when you blow into it.  it will make your life a lot easier to learn exactly where the keys are so that your fingers know where to go when you re playing.   through repeated playing muscle memory builds  so your fingers know where the keys are. practices pressing the keys  knowing which keys you re pressing. do this until you can pass a test of accuracy.it can help to have a fingering chart while you practice.  the volume of the notes you play will depend on how much air you blow into the horn  and how fast. the more air you blow  and the faster you blow it  the louder the note will sound  and vice versa .  to be a good french horn player you ll want to learn how to read music.   sheet music is the basis of many musical performances. you can also learn by ear  but most songs are played from sheet music. learning sheet music gives you a deeper understanding of how your instrument works  as well as music theory.  the most basic thing you ll learn first is the order of the notes and how they re placed on a music staff.many parts go into the relationship between notes and the staff. that s why this piece is so fundamental.    once you ve memorized the notes  the next step is to understand how the clefs work.there are two clefs that can show up on a music staff. the treble clef notates the higher pitches of music  and the bass clef notates the lower pitches.    sheet music notates how fast or slow a song is by the tempo. it s usually notated at the top of the sheet using a bpm  beats per minute  measurement.  once you have a pretty good understanding of the basics of sheet music  try playing a simple melody. pick something that only has a few notes and practice until you ve mastered it.    eventually  you can practice playing more complex melodies. this will help you play your instrument better and help you become better at reading sheet music.   pick music that has a variety of note structures  clefs  and tempos.    now that you can hold your instrument and play sitting down  it s time to play standing up. a french horn weighs about 4 pounds. there won t be many times when you ll need to play standing up  but recitals are a common one.since your right hand is in the bell anyway  just slide it up to the top of the bell so that it s resting on your hand. all your other hand placements stay the same. you can buy small modification pieces that help hold up the horn easier.    once you ve mastered the basics you re ready to learn more advanced playing techniques. it can be helpful to recruit a tutor or advanced player for these skills.   muting  or stopping  the horn creates a high pitched sound from the bell. you can stop the horn by moving your hand further into the bell until it s in all the way. twist it until little or no air can get out.slurring notes are playing two notes without stopping or releasing between. to do this you ll continue to change the notes on your keys but your airflow remains constant and steady.playing glissando is starting and ending on specific notes while playing as many notes between as you can.  lessons are a great way to learn advanced skills and get feedback on your progress. you can hire private tutors or join group classes. some classes will play at events  giving you an opportunity to show off your new chops.    you can find a lot of useful tutorial videos online. some of them will teach you to play using sheet music  and some will teach you to play by ear. if you search  you should find what you re looking for.    the most effective way to become a better horn player is to practice. make time to play your horn on a regular basis. create challenges for yourself by upping the ante on songs you play.   you can get books of sheet music that have a variety of songs with different levels of difficulty. tutor books sometimes include training schedules  often with lessons on reading sheet music.  don t be afraid to ask questions when you get stuck or aren t sure how to do something. there are lots of places you can go to get your questions answered.   you can consult tutors  french horn websites  video comment threads  and forums.    when you re not playing your horn  store it in a padded case. most cases have a hard shell to protect it from damage.    each time you play your horn you should clean it. this will prolong the life of the instrument.   polish it using a polishing cloth. if it s dirty  you can apply polishing gauze with a cloth.let the interior of the instrument dry. remove the valve slides and dry those while the rest of the body is drying.  every week or two you ll want to conduct routine maintenance on your instrument to make sure it stays in good condition for as long as possible.   clean the mouthpiece with dish soap and water. it might also be helpful to use a mouthpiece brush  which you can find at most music stores.oil the rotors and valves. remove the valve caps and apply key oil to the pivot points and bearing shaft.you ll know the valves need to be oiled if they stick.apply slide grease to the tuning slides. remove them  put the grease on them  and replace them.  every once in a while  you should do a full cleanse on your horn. that means flushing out the entire instrument with soap and water. use a brush to clean the tuning slides.if you want to take special care you can use brass soap to clean the horn.make sure you apply grease to the tuning slides before putting them back on the body of the horn.  if anything on your horn breaks  take it to a shop and get it repaired. it s a delicate piece of machinery that won t work if some of the parts are defective.

How do you pop a dent out of a car roof? How do you use a dent remover kit?  this is an especially useful method for removing small to medium sized dents  and you may have more of these then you think. examine your car carefully to find them all.    dents can typically be removed using this method if they are located on the metal panels of the trunk  hood  doors  roof  or fenders  and are not right along the edges on broad flat surfaces.to achieve the best results  use this method on shallow dents that do not contain major creases or paint damage  and that cover a surface area with a diameter of at least 3 inches  7.62 cm .    you will need a hair dryer  heavy duty or thick rubber gloves for safe handling of the dry ice or compressed air in its liquid format  aluminum foil  and either a package of dry ice or a can of compressed air. you will need some of the following    heavy duty insulated rubber coated gloves. a full  or nearly full  can of compressed air. a package of dry ice. a hair dryer with adjustable temperature settings  such as  low    medium   and  high   or  cool    warm   and  hot.  aluminum foil.    turn on the hair dryer and use it to blow hot air over the dent and the surrounding area for one to two consecutive minutes.   the hair dryer should be set to medium and should be held between 5 and 7 inches  12.7 and 17.78 cm  away from the car s surface. do not overheat the area in order to prevent the paint from becoming damaged due to overheating.  place a sheet of aluminum foil over the top of the dented area. this step should only be performed if you are using dry ice instead of compressed air. the purpose of this step is to keep the area warm while also protecting the paint from the dry ice  which can potentially damage the topcoat.    the gloves will protect you from frostbite and other injuries that can occur when your skin comes into contact with dry ice or liquified compressed air.    the rapid change in temperature from warm to cold will cause the surface of your vehicle to first expand  when heated  and then contract  when cooled .if you are using dry ice  grab a block of the ice with one hand  then gently rub it over the aluminum foil resting on top of the dented area. if you are using a can of compressed air  turn the can upside down  and spray the surface of the dented area to cover the area with a layer of liquid ice. there are some basic principles of science at work here  the pressure  volume  and temperature of a gas are all interconnected. while normally the can loses temperature as the gas is released  if you spray the can upside down the gas itself is cooled.either method will only require a brief application. the surface panels of most modern vehicles are made of relatively thin and lightweight material and they will cool very quickly. you will likely not see any change after the first 30 50 seconds of application  if not sooner still.    a few moments after you have applied the dry ice or compressed air  you may hear a popping sound that will indicate the dent has been removed. the rapid temperature shift will usually make the material reform its original shape.   if you used dry ice  remove and dispose of the aluminum foil after the dent has been removed. if you applied liquid ice by means of compressed air  wait for the white foam to dissipate from the surface of the car  then wipe residue away with a gentle cloth.    for certain dents a single application may not be enough. if you see improvement but a dent is still noticeable  you can begin the process of heating and cooling again. however  do no overuse this process  especially in a single day . while the rapid temperature changes can reshape your car exterior  the extreme cold is potentially hazardous to the paint.

Can Marmite be used as a drink? Does Marmite cure hangovers? Can Marmite be used as a drink? Is Marmite good for your skin? Can Marmite be used as a drink? Is Marmite made from Guinness?  in britain and other places where marmite is popular  it s often eaten as a spread on toast  crackers  and other baked bread products. since marmite has such a strong salty  yeasty taste  it s usually eaten in small quantities even by its fans. if you re using your marmite as a spread  rather than using a full spoonful of it like you might for jam or peanut butter  instead  use a tiny pea sized amount  like you would for toothpaste .   ideally  when you spread this tiny amount of marmite on your bread  it should leave a paper thin layer of marmite   just enough to discolor the bread. you don t want any noticeable  thickness  to the marmite  as this will give a seriously overpowering taste.    one of the most common ingredients to combine with marmite is butter  especially when the marmite is being used as a spread. butter s rich  smooth taste pairs well with the strong  salty flavor of marmite. if you hate marmite  try applying a generous helping of butter to your bread before or after you spread on the marmite   the more you use  the less you ll taste the marmite.to many  this makes marmite much more palatable.    getting used to eating marmite is like the old saying about how to boil a frog   if you drop a frog into a pot of hot water  it will jump out  but if you drop it into a pot of lukewarm water and slowly increase the heat  it won t know anything s wrong until it s too late rather than trying to wolf down your marmite in a few huge bites  instead  take small nibbles to begin. gradually  as you make progress  the strong  salty taste should become more bearable.   if you re having a hard time swallowing even small bites of your marmite spread  try moving each bite carefully to the back of your mouth so that you can swallow it without much chewing. this should minimize the amount you have to taste the marmite  but be careful   you ll need to take small bites to be able to swallow them without choking.    to keep the overpowering taste of marmite under control  try taking a drink after each bite of marmite you take. the drink will act as a chaser   the more you sip  the less you ll taste the marmite and the quicker the taste will leave your mouth.   plain  ordinary tap water is a good zero calorie chaser  but if you really hate the taste of marmite  you may want to consider a stronger tasting beverage. after each bite  try drinking a swig of your favorite soft drink  or  if you re old enough  a stiff cocktail. the strong flavors of these beverages should help  drown out  the marmite taste.    the senses of taste and smell closely interact with each other to produce the  effect  that you experience when eating food. the way something smells can affect the way it tastes to you  and vice versa .if you hate the taste of marmite  there s a very good chance you won t care for its smell  either. in this case  try your hardest not to smell the marmite as you eat it. usually  the taste  though still strong  will be a little less intense if you make an effort to hold your breath until the marmite has been swallowed  or nearly so .    perhaps the single easiest way to make marmite more manageable is to simply not make it the central feature of your dish. pairing marmite with other foods  especially ones with distinctive  powerful flavors of their own  can make it much more palatable. though you may never enjoy marmite by itself  you may even find that you enjoy it when paired with other foods or used as a minor ingredient in a large recipe    there s no  wrong  way to eat marmite   any food you enjoy it with is fair game. just a few foods that some marmite fans enjoy pairing their favorite yeasty spread with are eggs  cheese  meat  seafood  apricots  marmalade  and more in the next section  we ll explore a few more flavorful marmite combinations. feel free to use any of them as you see fit  or make your own     in small quantities  marmite can give soups  stews  and other hearty liquid dishes a rich  savory flavor  and also works great as a browning agent . for instance  try mixing a spoonful of marmite into a pot of french onion soup in place of beef stock   the flavor of the finished soup goes great with bread and cheese  just like ordinary marmite.in general  you can usually get away with substituting marmite mixed with water  your favorite vegetables  and a little oil for beef broth. this can allow you to make great tasting vegetarian versions of all your favorite carnivorous soups and stews.  many marmite fans agree  the spread pairs deliciously with a wide variety of cheeses. sharp cheddar is an especially great choice   the salty  yeasty flavor of the marmite enhances the  sharpness  of the cheese  making for a bold flavored  but tasty  combination. try adding a few slices of cheese to standard marmite and butter toast for a satisfying breakfast.  though it may sound odd  marmite can be a tasty ingredient to include in glazes and sauces for meat dishes. used correctly  marmite can give the outer  crust  of roasted meats  poultry  and seafood a rich  distinct  umami   savory  flavor. try painting a light mixture of melted butter and marmite over a whole roasted chicken for a savory treat   you should only need a spoonful or two to cover it.   if you use marmite as a meat glaze  you may want to forego sprinkling salt from the salt shaker on your meat  especially if you need to be careful about your sodium intake. marmite has a very high salt content   it s more than 10  salt by mass   believe it or not  some people not only eat their spaghetti with marmite   they love it. if you re willing to experiment  try adding a half teaspoon of marmite to al dente noodles along with a small helping of olive oil  you may want to avoid using fine tomato sauces or cheeses to top your dish until you re positive that you enjoy it    note that some fans of this recipe describe the flavor as being similar to the british snack food  twiglets .  if you ve recently gained an appreciation for marmite and you re looking to expand your repertoire  try this marmite centered sampler dish  which works as a hearty meal on its own and scales easily for larger groups. start by boiling a few eggs in a pot of water until they re hard boiled. depending on the size of the eggs  this should take about eight to ten minutes.   run cold water over the eggs after they re done cooking. cooling them down halts the cooking process and prevents them from overcooking.  next  let s get our vegetables ready for the marmite. wash a bell pepper  a handful of cherry tomatoes  a cucumber  a carrot  and a few clumps of broccoli under running water. cut each into small bite size pieces. any shapes that look appealing are fine  but  for efficiency s sake  you ll probably want to julienne your bell pepper  cut it into skinny strips  and take thin circular slices from your cucumber.    finally  make a few golden brown slices of marmite s most well known companion dish. you can use white  wheat  or even specialty breads like sourdough and rye here   it s up to you  when the toast is ready  butter it. as noted above  butter and

What pop works best with Mentos? Are Mentos vegan? What pop works best with Mentos? What is Mentos made out of?  for the purposes of this example  we re using diet coke  but you can actually use any type of diet soda  as long as it contains aspartame .   warm soda causes better explosions  so avoid using cold refrigerated soda.for best results  purchase room temperature soda and then let it sit outside in the sun or in a pot full of hot  not boiling  water for a few hours before using it.    experiments have shown that while the original mint mentos will give you a longer explosion  mentos fruit will give you slightly shorter but more intense explosion.other experiments have shown that mint mentos are the better choice because the gum arabic found in the mint coating reduces surface tension and quickens the carbon dioxide s escape from the bottle  making for a more intense explosion.as the rocket is more of a fast acting affair  you might want to go for mint mentos. if you have the time and money to do so  why not try one bottle with mint mentos and one with fruit mentos  and then compare the results     you probably have this one lying around your house already  but if you don t  you should be able to buy a roll just about anywhere  hardware stores are a safe bet .    wearing goggles will not only protect your eyes from the soda mentos concoction  but also from any other debris  for example  the lid  that might fly out from the bottle once it hits the ground and explodes.    your rocket is likely to bounce around like crazy  make sure it has enough room to do that. if you re in a parking lot  make sure there are no cars nearby for at least a 50 foot radius  if not more.   if there s a field or empty lot nearby  go there to make your rocket. you don t want to risk doing damage to anyone s car or home  as it could cost you or your parents a lot of money to repair.    it s possible you ll get covered in the sticky diet coke mentos solution. wear clothes and shoes that you don t mind getting wet and sticky   preferably ones that are easy to wash.    bring your 2 liter bottle of diet coke  your pack of mentos  your masking tape  and your safety goggles to wherever you ve decided to build your rocket.    place the strips of tape on a flat surface  with their sticky sides facing up. do not allow them to stick together.    the more mentos you use  the better the explosion  however  you don t want to the mentos to dip too far into the diet coke otherwise the explosion may begin before you can screw the lid on the bottle.    they should look just as they did when they were still in their original packaging  stacked on top of one another like a roll of coins.    be sure to leave the sides of the mentos exposed.    you ll use this piece to attach the mentos to the bottle cap  so ensure that it s small enough to fit inside the cap.    take the 3 inch strip of sticky rolled tape that you ve just created and attach it to the top of the taped roll of mentos. this will create a  loaded  mentos cartridge that you can place inside the diet coke bottle.    put the cap on a flat surface  with its inside facing upwards. place the mentos cartridge  sticky tape side up  into the soda cap and press down to fasten it there.   be careful not to press too hard  as you don t want any mentos falling out of the cartridge     this step is optional. if you re worried about the mentos prematurely falling into the diet coke  you can secure the cartridge by running one more piece of masking tape around the entire roll  including the cap.    the cap should be securely on the bottle  but not closed too tightly. if it s closed too tightly  the cap might not come off when you throw the bottle  and the rocket won t work. as you twist the cap on  you ll also want to make sure that the mentos do not touch the diet coke yet.  if it seems like the mentos will touch the diet coke  you can either dump a small amount of diet coke out before screwing the cap on  redo your mentos cartridge to contain fewer mentos  or you can try your luck and screw the cap on as quickly as possible.    shake it so that the mentos fall into the diet coke  and then keep shaking. do this for at least a few seconds.    there are several different methods for  launching  your rocket    a popular and effective one is to throw the bottle high up into the air and let it fall on to the ground  preferably hard ground  like cement . this is the best method if you re worried about getting hit by the rocket  as you can throw it far away from you and even run in the opposite direction. another method is to throw the bottle at a side angle so that when it hits the ground  the ground knocks off its cap. yet another method is to throw the bottle at more of a 90 degree angle  cap first  on to the ground.    you can skip this step if your rocket works right away. if the rocket doesn t go off when you throw it  pick it up and try unscrewing the cap a little before throwing it again. just be careful not to unscrew the cap too far  otherwise you re likely to end up covered in diet coke.  when the bottle hits the ground  its cap should fly off and the diet coke mentos solution will shoot out of the bottle s opening. this should cause the bottle to fly high up into the air. depending on how you throw it  the bottle might also bounce around sporadically for several seconds.   side angle launches generally seem to cause the bottle to bounce low and skid along the ground. vertical launches  in which you throw the bottle straight up into the air and let it fall to the ground  tend to give the rocket more height as it shoots upward. if the bottle is still full of diet coke and mentos but it s stopped moving on the ground  you can try to launch it again to see if it has any more flight left in it.    once you ve finished your experiment  don t forget to pick up after yourself. clean up any bits of tape or mentos packaging that might have dropped to the ground as you built your rocket. and pick up the rocket  clean out the bottle and put it in the recycling bin  or bring it to the bottle depot .    the more mentos  the better the explosion. experiment with putting different amounts of mentos into the diet coke bottle to see what yields the best explosion.    studies have shown that mint and fruit mentos yield different explosions. try mixing them together in one cartridge and adding them to your diet coke bottle to see what sort of explosion they cause when they are mixed together.    fill an empty 4 liter milk jug with 4 liters  2 two liter bottles  of diet coke. leave enough room at the top to add at least an 8 mento cartridge.   as with the original rocket recipe  stick the mentos cartridge to the lid of the milk jug  fasten the lid  shake the container to release the mentos into the diet coke  then throw the jug high up into the air and let it hit the pavement hard.    get together with your friends and each make your own rocket. set up a flag or some other way of measuring height  and have a judge watch and name the winner.

probably can t be found for sale anywhere. consider using this watch as a functional  stylish accessory  the way it was meant to be used when it was created.   be careful. remember that heirloom watches are usually irreplaceable. be sure you re willing to take the risk of carrying it around with you before you decide to wear it.  properly securing the watch to a chain and hooking it onto a button or loop will help ensure that it does not become lost. this process is explained in greater detail below.   get it fixed. heirloom watches may not always work  or may work erratically. there is no reason you shouldn t take your watch in to a respected watch repair person if it isn t working perfectly. just ask around online first to find a repair shop that will take good care of your watch.  it is all right to send your watch to a repair person by mail if you are absolutely sure he or she will do a good job. broken or irregular pocket watches can still be worn as accessories  but you re likely to feel silly pulling them out of your pocket to  check the time.    clean it up. consider buying some metal polish and gently cleaning and polishing your heirloom pocket watch. many of them have tarnish and scuffing around the edges that will clean right out with a soft cloth  a safe polish  and a bit of elbow grease.  if your heirloom watch has etching or engraving on it  be sure to gently clean out the grooves as well. this will remove any grime built up in them and can sometimes make a dramatic difference in a watch s appearance.      if you don t have an heirloom pocket watch  you ll have to buy one for yourself. pocket watches come in many materials and finishes  so pick whichever look you like.   pick a metal. silver is often preferred by modern buyers  as it goes well with all color combinations and has a lustrous finish. other common materials include brass  gold  and steel. consider the level of detail. pocket watch designs range from simple  plain surfaces to ornately finished covers. watches with carved or engraved covers often have patterns  monograms or woodland scenes on them  and can add a unique look to your outfit. decide between new and used. each has its advantages.  new watches are likely to work for a long time without trouble  and represent the latest in pocket watch design. they are likely to be more expensive than used watches. used pocket watches offer a great variety of designs  motifs  and finishes. most used watches cost less than new ones  but prices can vary widely based on how collectible a given watch is.  don t buy a used pocket watch over the internet. there is no way to tell how well it will work or what its relative size is  in most cases.        the watch chain serves two purposes  first  it secures your pocket watch to your clothing so that you can t drop it on the ground or misplace it  second  it completes the look of the watch.   start with the standard type. ordinarily  you should pick a watch chain that has the same finish as your watch  thus  if your watch is steel  pick a steel chain  and so on.  chain weight and weave are up to each individual to decide. consider a fine  thin chain for dressing to the nines  lean towards a thick  durable chain for a look that will survive hard labor and adventuring.  be careful to pick a chain that is durable enough to keep your watch secure if you expect to wear it somewhere it might get hit or yanked.     add a strap or fob. if you plan to wear your pocket watch in a pants pocket instead of on your chest  consider attaching a leather strap or watch fob to it instead. they re generally sturdier than watch chains  and suggest a rugged  casual look.  you can also purchase a leather holder  which attaches to a belt loop and holds the watch outside your pants for a bolder statement.   mix up your collection. at the very least  a few different chain weights and lengths are recommended so that you can wear your watch on different outfits.  consider bucking tradition and mismatching your chain. like a fob  the different color will offset the finish of your pocket watch and make it pop.  be careful to pick combinations that look premeditated  rather than thrown together. your watch and chain should still look good no matter what.        pocket watches are an old fashioned accessory  but there are as many ways to wear them as there are ideas you can come up with. here are a few general looks you might consider    the classic  wear your pocket watch in a suit vest pocket for an old fashioned look. the watch chain should be hooked to a button on your vest  and the watch should go in the vest pocket with the watch face toward your body so that you can check the time as soon as you pull it out.  if you are right handed  the watch should go in your left vest pocket  and vice versa. this allows you to draw the watch while leaving your dominant hand free.   the casual  wear your pocket watch in a pants pocket for a bit of flash that will go unnoticed until you pull it out. hook the strap to a belt loop  and leave the watch face in inside your dominant front pocket as usual.  this look works better with a watch that has a larger face  since you won t be able to look at it as closely without unhooking it.   the laborer  pocket watches were never just the domain of the rich. although that is how we perceive them today  there was a time when anyone whose job required them to know the time carried a pocket watch. try an unusual retro look by wearing overalls with a pocket watch in the front bib pocket.  this look works better with a rugged  heavy chain  as it is a working man s outfit designed to take a lot of abuse. complete your ensemble with a loose fit collared work shirt  a newsboy cap  and chunky construction boots.   the theatrical  because a pocket watch is such a bold statement  it can be a useful accessory for themed outfits  such as costumes or ensembles that reflect your membership in a subculture.  consider buying an unusual fob or chain to offset the watch and make it a coordinated part of your outfit. since pocket watches are associated with wealth and conservatism  try wearing one in the jeans vest of a punk outfit to make a contrarian statement. pocket watches are a classy and impressive accessory for a steampunk ensemble. again  keep the watch hooked to a vest or shirt pocket to accentuate its old fashioned touch.      all but the newest pocket watches will run on time for between 26 and 30 hours per wind at most. even the latest models only last about 46 hours. regardless of what type of pocket watch you own  plan to give it a full wind every day.   the best time to wind your watch is in the morning. you can make it part of your daily routine  and the watch almost always gets wound at the same time each day  ensuring reliability.    a soft  dry chamois or microfiber cloth is suitable for gently lifting skin oil and dirt off of metal surfaces. use a tiny bit of metal cleaner if needed. clean your watch every time you are done wearing it.   if you wear your watch most days  clean it two to three times weekly  or as needed. don t forget to periodically wipe down the inside faces of the watch with your dry cloth.    use a polish designed for the metal of your watch to keep it shiny. apply a bit of polish  per the directions on the package  every few months or as needed.   if you need to remove tarnish  avoid products that require submersion in liquid. this can damage or loosen the delicate inner pieces of a pocket watch. use the same polish on your chain  assuming it s made of a similar material.    always make sure the watch fob or chain is securely attached to the watch at one end  and an item of clothing at the other.   attach your chain to an item of clothing you don t plan to remove. avoid jackets and other such layered coverings.

Can you replace windows without replacing the frame? Can you replace your own windows? What is a double hung window?  this choice should be made based on the styling of your home  as well as your budget. the four common frame types are  wood  vinyl or metal clad wood  and all vinyl or all wood.   wood frames  if the exterior of your home features natural wood siding  a wood frame will complement your home nicely. wood frames are generally more expensive  but they do offer a low heat transfer and can be very energy efficient. if you re looking for low maintenance  however  they don t exactly fit the bill. they must be properly primed and painted  as well as repainted every few years to maintain their appeal. vinyl metal clad window frames  many replacement window manufacturers offer a wood frame window with a metal or vinyl  wrapping  on the exterior of the window. as long as the  wrapping  is sealed  the window is relatively maintenance free. you can also choose a color that complements the exterior of your home  without having to repaint every few years.  keep in mind that although the window unit is maintenance free  you will still have to either paint the exterior trim to match the window wrapping or replace the trim with a vinyl product like azek.   metal window frames  if you re looking for low maintenance as well as low cost  a metal frame might be a good choice. metal windows and siding are less stylish than they used to be  but that doesn t mean that you can t make them look good in your home. vinyl frames  vinyl replacement windows are extremely popular because they are easy to install  cost effective  and energy efficient.         some people take the height measurement from the top of the sill. this leaves room to attach a  header expander  to the top of the new window. others  though  dislike using header expanders because they decrease effective window size  and complicate the trim process.    since the new unit will need to be installed at least close to plumb  adjust your measurements accordingly. this will ensure that you have the largest size window that can be installed plumb  and level in the opening provided.    this is due to the fact that replacement windows are made to order in increments of 1 4.     this will keep the paint from chipping or peeling away from the casing when you remove the stops. this will also make removing the window stops easier  paint is a surprisingly good adhesive.   use a thin flat bar or even a putty knife to separate stubborn joints. this will minimize denting or marring other parts of the window trim.    using a hinging motion  swing the top of the window into the room until it is horizontal. then  twist the window into the opening by lifting up one side and pressing down on the other until the window is free.   every window is different some might take a little muscle to remove. don t worry about scratching the inside of the jambs while removing the window  it ll get covered anyway. if the window is cracked or particularly stubborn  wear gloves and eye protection in case it shatters while removing it.    if the original window was an older  weighted window  there may be pulleys at the top of the jamb that need to be removed. clear any dust from the bottom corners of the frame to ensure a good bond with the sealant.    if there were weights  remove the pulleys and apply a small amount of caulk to any holes.    sill flashing for a vinyl window is an  l  shaped piece of vinyl that is the same width as the replacement window unit. the vertical part of the  l  shape is slotted  allowing it to clip onto the bottom  outer edge of the window unit and shed water away from the bottom of the window.    mark both sides where it hits the exterior window stops. remove the lower part of the  l  shape on both sides as marked to allow the sill flashing to fit into place. once trimmed  lay the sill flashing back in place and trace the outside edge with a pencil.    make sure you get both sides and the top. then  apply a 1 4  bead directly to the wood sill on the inside of your pencil line.   nan  the bottom should be angled away and in to the opening. once the bottom of the unit has cleared the sill and is against the exterior stops  press down on the window and swing the top into the frame.   press the window firmly and evenly against the stops to ensure a good seal.     these are usually located about four inches from the top and bottom on both sides.    be sure the window is centered in the window opening.  keep in mind that vinyl is much softer  and more flexible than wood. over tightening the screws can damage the frame of the window.    nan nan  leave about a 1 4  gap along the bottom. this gap should be parallel to the windowsill.   if the gap is larger on the right side  loosen the top right screw and tighten the top left screw or loosen the bottom left screw and tighten the bottom right screw. if the gap is larger on the left side  loosen the top left screw and tighten the top right screw or loosen the bottom right screw and tighten the bottom left screw.   nan nan  if necessary  apply a thin bead around the perimeter to eliminate any voids  and leave a smooth  weather tight seal.  
query	213	stained glass cut  if you re just starting out making stained glass you don t want to reach too far too quickly. start with a smaller  simpler pattern that doesn t require too many parts.   beginners might consider a simple panel to affix to a window  for example. you want a project that doesn t have too many sharp edges  that doesn t have so many parts to keep track of. a simple panel for your window can be a great start     you want to find a pattern that you like and that your skill level will allow you to do. consider things like how many glass pieces the pattern will need and how much cutting and soldering you re going to have to do. if you re just starting out  again  it s best to pick a simpler pattern.   there are lots of free patterns out there  you can get them on the internet  in books from the library  and so on. the beauty of a pattern that s already available is that you don t have to figure out how it s going to work  that work has already been done for you. create your own pattern. you could create your pattern based on something that you saw around you  or a pattern that you saw somewhere  like in a cathedral s stained glass window  that you re trying to replicate on your own. look for inspiration in books and in nature. beginners should choose a pattern that is broad and simple  such as a flower  although  be mindful of the curves and the sharp edges .    sheet glass is what you ll be using for this project. it falls into two basic categories  cathedral and opalescent. you will also need to consider things like price  texture  color  and degree of transparency.   stained glass comes in large sheets. the smallest sheet is approximately 1 foot  0.3 m  by 1 foot  30.48 cm by 30.48 cm  with the largest being four times that size. buy enough glass for the size of your project  but keep in mind that about a quarter of what you buy will not be utilized after trimming. cathedral glass tends to be a clear or transparent color. it s composed of clear glass with colorants added. this glass requires less pressure to cut through opalescent glass incorporates white  or opal glass  into the color mix. an opalescent blue is blue glass that is not entirely transparent  for example. opalescent glass tends to require more pressure to cut through  because the opal of the glass creates a higher density than cathedral glass. you can combine these two types together in your project if you want an interesting mix of clear and opaque. keep in mind that they need slightly differently handling  as evidenced by the pressure needed to cut through them . there is also streaky glass which tends to be cathedral glass with streaks of opal mixed in.    the best place to get stained glass for your project is at a stained glass supply shop. you can find both equipment for making stained glass as well as the stained glass itself. you can also get stained glass at some of the larger hobby and craft stores  but you ll get a better selection at a shop specific to stained glass.   most of the glass you buy comes in sheets about one square foot  30 cm  and one eighth of an inch thick. the sheet can be anywhere from  6 to  20 depending on the color and the detail in the glass  the strength and brightness of the colors. it can also depend on where the glass comes from. glass that comes from europe is simply going to cost more. this is often called antique glass even if it was made in modern times.    you ll need to gather some specific equipment for making your stained glass project. you can find these items at most hobby or craft stores  but especially at stained glass supply shops.glass cutter  there are lots of different glass cutters available. the hand cutter has the best flexibility and accuracy in template cutting. the pencil style cutter is great for beginners  as well as those doing trace cutting  because it has consistent pressure and control. the pistol grip is great for cutting thick glass and is also a good choice for beginners whose hand strength isn t enough. pliers  ordinary house pliers shouldn t be used for this. you ll need grozer pliers for breaking glass and nipping off edges as well as running pliers for snapping long cuts in the glass. copper foil comes in a variety of widths depending on the width of your glass. this is used to hold the glass pieces together through the adhesive on the one side. if you re using cathedral glass  clear glass  the backing will be visible so make sure you re using the right color for your piece. soldering iron and solder  solder is a mixture of tin and lead. the higher the tin content  the lower the melting point  which means it will flow more quickly and with a more silvery finish. as for the soldering iron you ll need one that is designed for stained glass projects with a minimum of 75 watts. the irons come with different sized tips  depending on your project. grinder  if you don t have access to a grinder you can use a carborundum stone to grind down the edges of your glass after cutting. if you can get a grinder the electric glass grinder is great for dealing with sharp edges quickly.    draw  copy or print out your pattern on a piece of graph paper that s the actual size. cut the pattern into its separate pieces and label them by color and grain direction. place the pattern under the glass and trace the outline with a thin permanent marker.leave a centimeter or less of room for the thickness of the copper foil between the pieces. use either a specialty black pen or a permanent marker to mark the glass. if you have access to a lightbox this can be incredibly helpful for tracing the pattern onto the glass.    hold the glass cutter between your thumb and your forefinger with the tip pressed between your forefinger and your middle finger. press the cutter into the glass gently  using a cork backed  steel ruler to cut straight. begin at a point away from your body and begin scraping inward.make sure that you re applying the right amount of pressure. you should hear a nice  clear  zzzzip  as you score. if you apply too little pressure  the break will not follow the score line. too much pressure and you ll cause unnecessary wear and tear on your cutter as well as your wrist and elbow. move your pattern around  rotating the glass as necessary to keep proper form. make sure that the score line goes from edge to edge.    there are a few slightly different methods to cutting your glass  depending on the size and the curve of the glass. the goal  of course  is to cut the glass along the scored lines so that it breaks apart easily and leaves you with the shapes that you need.   for straight pieces  as soon as you see a line forming  place pliers in the crack and squeeze to separate the piece. you can also hold the glass on either side of the break and snap it apart with your hands.for curved sections  use the glass cutter to break through the scoring. don t worry if the piece breaks off slightly jagged  you can remove edges later if you need to. as long as you keep your curves gentle. if you re dealing with deep curves  deal with it in a series of shallow curves so that it won t break on its own.  once you ve cut all the different pieces  it s time to grind down the sharp edges and make sure that everything is smooth. you will want to grind away gently and patiently so that you don t chip any of the pieces.   put the pieces along the pattern again so that you can grind down the glass into corrective lines. this will make sure that everything fits well together when you put the glass pieces together. it s also a good idea to build a frame around the pieces when you ve finished grinding them and fitting them together. this way the pieces won t slip when you re foiling the glass.    cover the edges of the glass with 7 32 inch copper foil. make sure the foil is centered  otherwise it can look a little funky at the end.. this can be done by hand or with a table foiler.   once you ve decided on the thickness of your copper foil  you need to peel off the protective backing of the foil. make sure that you center your glass correctly on the tape and press it securely along all the cut edges. press the foil down hard with tongue depressor  or other firm instrument. this will ensure the foil adheres to the glass. you will want to make sure that the tape is very securely adhered as well as even. if a section gets bunched up  tear it off and start again.    while flux helps the solder flow between the copper taped pieces  it isn t one hundred percent necessary. however  it can make things easier for you in the long run.   brush each copper foiled surface with the flux before you solder each time. the gel form is the easiest and most forgiving to use  although you can also try out the liquid form.    soldering the glass takes a bit of time and patience. there are several different things you need to do to make sure you re soldering properly. you have to tack together your pieces  then you have to tin the seams  and finally you add the bead.   to tack all the pieces together apply small dots of flux to desired areas  and melt a small blob of solder on top. once you ve got all the pieces tacked together you can tin the seams. to tin the seams you first add flux to all of the seams  then apply a thin  flat amount of solder to all of the seams. make sure that you completely coat all of the copper foil. apply a new layer of flux to the tinned seams  then melt a larger amount of solder onto the seams. run your soldering iron back and forth over to create a melted seam of solder. once a section is completely melted you ll lift the iron up from your piece to create a smooth bead.    framing isn t absolutely necessary but it can create a nice finish to your piece. you could use a zinc frame or a lead channel  which requires more soldering  exactly the same as the steps outlined above.    especially when you re a beginner you can screw up with cutting the glass or grinding it down. this will leave you with gaps between your pieces.   compensate for these inaccuracies by filling the gaps between your glass pieces with copper solder. solder as you would normally.    there are lots of things that can go wrong with scoring your glass and most of these have to do with how you re standing  how much pressure you re using  and what sort of a cutter you re using.make sure that you re standing for long scores. this will give you better reach by utilizing your shoulder and upper body in the scoring motion. for small scores  make sure that you stay seated so you can concentrate on following the marker score line. use the right glass cutter. you do not want to use a five dollar cheap glass cutter as it doesn t cut clear  thin glass very well and it certainly won t cut much harder art glass. get one that it has a carbide head  because the oil lubrication is very useful. make sure that you apply even pressure throughout your scoring. remember you should hear a zipping sound as you score. also good to remember  opalescent glass requires more pressure  cathedral glass requires less pressure.    like scoring  soldering your glass can yield some problems if you re not doing it correctly. make sure that the heat is correct  that the tip of the soldering iron is the right size for the project  and that the flux you re using is good for higher temperatures.using the wrong kind of flux can lead to charring  called  black tip syndrome.  when this happens it means that the tip of the soldering iron turns black and re tinning becomes impossible. use the right size soldering iron tip. make sure that you know what the width of the glass you re working with is and have the tip and the copper spaced accordingly.

with your skin tone.avoid peach eyeshadows that lean too orange. they are usually too warm for fair skin.    medium skin tones can also wear light pinky peach shadows  but more intense peach shades tend to stand out more. consider a mid tone peach with stronger orange undertones.mid tone peach shadows will typically have  peach  in their shade names  such as  candied peach  or  peach pop.     if you have a tan complexion  you want to choose peach shadows that have enough depth to them to show up against your skin. opt for bronzey peach shades that will complement the similar bronze tones in your own skin.bronze peach shadows often have shade names such as  golden peach  or  sunkissed peach.     dark skin can wear nearly any type of peach eyeshadow. however  for the most flattering look  it s best to choose a bright  rich peach eyeshadow that will complement your deeper skin tone.bright peach shades tend to have shade names such  vivid peach  or  intense peach.     in addition to the tones in a peach shadow  it s also important to consider the finish. a matte peach shadow has no shine  glitter  or shimmer  while a shimmery or metallic peach shadow offers rich shine. a satin peach shadow isn t completely flat  but only provides minimal shine.matte peach shadows can work as a lid or highlight shade  but they re especially good for using in the crease. they re also the best option if you have mature or wrinkled eyelids because they won t draw as much attention to fine lines. shimmery or metallic peach shadows are best used as lid or highlight shades. satin peach shadows can be used all over the eye.    no matter what color eyeshadow you re wearing  it s important to apply a shadow primer to your eyelids first. the primer helps keep your eyeshadow in place all day and prevents creasing. dab a small amount on each eyelid  and blend it in with a clean finger.if you don t have an eyeshadow primer  you can use a little concealer instead.    if you want your peach eyeshadow to be the star of your eye look  apply it to your eyelid. use a flat eyeshadow brush to gently pat or press the shadow onto your lid for the most opaque peach color.light or mid tone peach shadows with a shimmery or metallic finish work best as lid shades. if you really want the peach shadow on your lid to be bold and intense  consider using a peach cream eyeshadow as a base. use a

it soft  blend it through the crease. use a fluffy  tapered crease brush to lightly sweep the peach shadow through your crease.your crease is the area where your eye lid naturally folds. a mid tone or dark peach shadow with a matte or satin finish works best as a crease shade. if you re working with a lighter peach shadow  it can actually serve as a transition shade. that s a shadow that helps your

brown shades that will allow the peach to pop.if you re using a light peach shadow on the lid  pair it with dark tan  taupe  gray  or brown shades in the crease. if you re using a mid tone or dark peach shadow in the crease  pair it with a cream  ivory  beige  or light tan shade on the lid.    if you want to make a bold statement with your peach eyeshadow  pair it with contrasting shades. blue

rich blue shades  such as navy or teal. darker greens  such as olive or forest  work best too. if you want a bold peach eye look but don t want to use contrasting shades  consider going monochromatic.

liner works well with peach tones  but brown shades  such as bronze or copper  are especially flattering. next  apply one to two coats of your favorite black mascara to help your lashes look longer

them before you apply the mascara.    when you re wearing peach shades on your eyes  it s important to add a little warmth to your skin to keep your look balanced. use a fluffy face brush to apply

Why do my eyelash extensions hurt when I blink?  before selecting extensions  examine your own lashes. the longer and healthier they are  the more weight they can withstand.   if you ve never applied extensions before  consider starting with a half set to see how your natural lashes hold up. you can always add more extensions later if you want a fuller or more exaggerated look.    mink is the most expensive and synthetic is the least. the lengths usually range from 6mm to 17mm.extensions also come in a variety of thicknesses  curls and colors. think about what your ultimate goal is before making a choice.   for example  if your goal is to create a natural look  you could select medium length extensions in brown black. if you are buying extensions as part of a costume  or if you re going for a unique look  explore different color options and thicknesses.    once you ve settled on a basic length and thickness  choose individual lashes that vary slightly in length. a subtle variation will provide the most natural looking results.three sizes in a similar length range should be sufficient. the shortest extensions will be used to fill in any gaps in the lash line and keep the overall appearance from looking unnatural and crowded.    if you plan to apply the extensions yourself  get a kit from a beauty supply store. a kit will include different sized lashes  usually short  medium and long   along with all the tools you ll need for application   tweezers  adhesive  adhesive remover and an eyelash brush. if you ve never applied extensions before  buying a kit will make the process a lot easier.   each kit is different. read and follow the instructions included with the kit carefully. check the ingredients on the adhesive. make sure it doesn t have formaldehyde listed as an ingredient.    applying eyelash extensions on yourself can be risky  since the adhesive can irritate your skin or damage your natural lashes if not applied properly. if you don t feel comfortable applying extensions yourself  find a certified professional to do it for you the first time.   after going through the process once  you ll probably feel more at ease doing it at home. start by researching technicians in your area. make sure they re licensed and find out how long they ve been doing this professionally.  if this is your first time applying extensions  it s a good idea to have a friend nearby to help you out. the application process requires that you juggle several different tools and  when it comes to actually gluing the extensions on  you need to be completely still. your eye also needs to be completely shut when you glue it on  and all of this is difficult to do with just two hands.   the application process will go much faster and more smoothly with an assistant. it will also be a lot safer for you. there is a higher risk of getting adhesive in your eye and other mishaps when you re working alone.    for the adhesive to stick properly  your natural lashes must be clean and free of makeup residue. they also need to be completely dry. start by applying makeup remover to a cotton pad and gently swiping it across both eyes. remove every trace of makeup around the eye area. rinse the area with lukewarm water.          allow your eyelashes to dry before you begin applying the extensions. comb your upper lashes with an eyelash brush to smooth and separate them. this brush  which looks like a mascara wand  should come with your extension kit.    your extension kit should include some sort of gel pad or tape to help pat down the bottom lashes. this will protect your skin from the adhesive. the adhesive pad also makes it easier to see and work on the individual lashes. when your eyelid is closed  the upper lashes will be against the white color  emphasizing the areas where you re working.           since you re starting at the outermost corner of your eye  your longest extensions will be used first. squeeze a dime sized amount of lash adhesive onto a smooth surface that s easily accessible for you. then use the tweezers to grab your first cluster and carefully dip the knotted end in the adhesive.          you only need a tiny amount of glue. if you use too much  the end result will look messy.  slowly drop the synthetic lash onto your natural lash  as close to the base of your eyelashes as possible. the glue should only touch your lash  not your skin. once the extension is dropped onto your natural lash  you will have about 60 seconds to situate it before the glue sets.          after you do one eye  do the same for the other. you will work back and forth to ensure both eyes look even. the glue can cause eyelid irritation if it touches your skin. make sure the glue touches your natural lashes only.    for the most natural look  the longest extensions will go on the outer edges. continue until you ve applied three to four of the longest extensions to the outer third of both eyes. make sure the extensions aren t too close together  since you will be filling in between them with shorter pieces.          use the tweezers to adjust each extension as needed within the first 60 seconds of dropping it.    work from the outside corners inward  just as you did before. be sure to do one eye  then the other. work back and forth so both eyes look even.          as you work  use the tweezers to periodically push the applied extensions down onto your natural lashes. this will help you keep everything in place. take your time. extension application is not a quick process.    use the medium length extensions and place three to four of them on your lashes. continue to work from the outside in. cover the middle third of your eyelid on both sides.           the short ones can be a little harder to work with  so just go in as far as you can. then use the shortest extensions to fill in any empty spaces you see in the middle sections of both eyes.           do not apply any mascara or eye makeup for several hours after application. if possible  try not to touch the extensions at all. give freshly applied extensions at least 12 to 24 hours before getting them wet. the life of your extensions will vary based on the type and how well they were applied  but they should last anywhere from two to eight weeks.professionally applied extensions should last through one growth cycle. this varies from person to person  but it s usually about six to eight weeks.    use an eyelash brush or a clean mascara wand to gently brush them out every morning. try to sleep on your back at night. this will cut down on the amount of time you need to spend every morning combing them out.           mascara applied to the base of the extensions usually ends up getting clumpy.   do not curl your eyelashes before you apply mascara. this can pull the extensions out. avoid water proof mascara completely. it s too hard to remove.do not wear oil based mascara with eyelash extensions  as this can loosen the adhesive.    invest in a high quality remover that requires that you rub as little as possible. use the makeup remover or pre moistened wipes to completely remove your makeup every day. avoid oil based makeup removers  which can loosen the adhesive. makeup must be removed very gently to avoid pulling off the extensions.           if you lose any pieces very early on  try to use a bit of mascara to conceal the gaps. a touch up every three to four weeks will keep your extensions looking full and at their best. you can also do maintenance as needed  adding new pieces on as you lose the originals.

Is lacquer thicker than polyurethane? What is the difference between lacquer and polyurethane finish? Can you brush on lacquer?  lacquer can be applied either with disposable  pre filled aerosol cans or spray guns  which require you to mix your lacquer  load the gun yourself  and adjust settings and attachments. to reduce prep  and guesswork  go with aerosol cans. however  be sure to factor in the surface area s  of the wood to be sprayed when choosing between the two methods  since aerosol cans are not ideal for very large surface areas.when applying each coat  you want to cover all of a given surface area before the lacquer starts to dry anywhere. however  lacquer dries very quickly  which makes doing large surface areas with aerosol cans problematic. for instance  coffee tables and chests are probably too large for aerosol cans. boxes and cabinets  however  are more ideal.    if spraying lacquer is something you re going to be doing repeatedly  invest in a spray gun. also use these for projects with surface areas four feet  1.2 m  long and over. there are numerous brands and models on the market to choose from  but spray guns are mainly divided into these categories air assisted airless sprayers  aaa   ideal for very large projects  with less labor needed for each piece of wood. gravity feed guns  easy to clean and operate  making them perfect for diy beginners. high volume  low pressure guns  hvlp   also suitable for diy projects  although they require some precise setup beforehand for best results. pressured guns  adjustable pressure allows for more varied results if you like to tinker with your finishes. suction feed guns  lacquer can be used in these by practiced hands  but are not advised for beginners.    aerosol cans are ready to use straight off the shelf  but spray guns require you to mix your lacquer with thinner before filling the gun. how much to add depends on your project  climate  and current weather conditions  so purchase both your lacquer and thinner from a local brick and mortar store. ask the staff what ratio is recommended based on the type of lacquer to be used  your current weather  and the nature of your project.for instance  colored lacquers may require equal parts thinner and lacquer  while clear lacquers use substantially less thinner. in areas with constant high humidity  staff may also advise that you add a retarder.    working indoors allows you more control over the elements  which can affect the quality of your finish   but always prioritize safety over results. lacquer is toxic to inhale  so base your decision on the amount of ventilation that your workspace receives. only work inside if your workspace is constantly replenished with fresh air. if in doubt  err on the side of caution and work outside.for instance  a two car garage with both doors open and industrial fans set up to circulate air should be fine. a basement with shoebox windows  on the other hand  should not be used. whether you work inside or outside  always wear a full face respirator with carbon filter cartridges.    lacquer and other materials used are highly flammable  so do not use near open flames or heat sources.inform family or other housemates to keep themselves and any pets away from the area while you are spraying  since the mist created by spraying lacquer is dangerous to breathe. additionally  do the following  depending on whether you are working indoors or out    indoors  clean the work area of dust and bugs  both of which can become trapped in lacquer as it dries.cover your worktable  floor  and any other nearby surfaces with drop cloths or other protective covering. open all windows and set up exhaust fans. outdoors  pick a shaded area to avoid direct sunlight  which can ruin your finish. always choose a calm  windless day to work  but also pick an area shielded from wind just in case. cover your work surface and the surrounding ground with drop cloths to reduce fire hazards caused by over spray.    both temperature and humidity can adversely affect the quality of your finish  so only spray when conditions are right. remember the number 65. avoid spraying when the temperature dips below 65 degrees fahrenheit  18 degrees celsius  or when the humidity rises above 65 .wet lacquer can absorb the moisture in the air  which will cloud the lacquer as it dries  a defect known as  blushing.     lacquer doesn t work well with all woods  so make sure you re not about to use it on an unsuitable type. for the best finishes stick with cherry  maple  mahogany  and walnut. refrain from using it on woods with coarse  open grains  like ash and cherry. soft woods  like cedar and redwood. oily woods  like cocobolo.    sand each piece of wood to be sprayed to get rid of any imperfections. begin with p120 grit paper and then go over each piece again with p150 grit. then use a damp cloth to moisten the surface  which helps highlight any remaining irregularities. finish with p180 grit to smooth the surface down.sanding is necessary because lacquer will highlight defects once applied. however  the dust created is a problem  since it could end up settling in the lacquer when wet.sand everything to be sprayed first to get it out of the way so you can clean your workspace thoroughly afterward. then allow time for any airborne dust to settle. breaking your project up into two days  one for sanding  one for spraying  will help keep the air clear of sawdust.    with furniture  cover any areas that have been pre cut for joinery and later assembly  such as the slots for shelf pegs in a bookcase . avoid filling these keys and slots with spray  which can build up and block the pieces that will eventually fit into them. do the same with any rabbets  where the face or edge of the wood has been trimmed so that another piece can line up with it there.if your furniture is already assembled  it s always best to break it back down into individual pieces  rather than spray it as is.    whether you re using aerosol cans or spray guns  always read the instructions before operating. these may vary between types and manufacturers  especially with spray guns. ensure safe and efficient use by following its recommended use.  again  with spray guns  the distance that you should maintain between the gun s tip and the wood may vary. however  expect it to be between 8 and 12 inches  20 and 30 cm . maintain this distance from start to finish to ensure that the lacquer disperses consistently over the entire surface area.  instead of starting at the very edge of your wood  start spraying a little bit past it  directly over your dropcloth. then move over the edge and down the length of the wood. similarly  go right over the opposite edge before stopping your spray. spraying well past either end will ensure a consistent spray over the whole length of the wood  including the very edges.  if your wood is too wide to cover in a single spray from end to end  spray cross its narrowest edge first. then  as you apply a second row below that first spray  aim so that half of it covers the first row of spray. prevent unsightly build ups along the edges of each row by applying an even amount of spray throughout.  thicker coats may cause build up and runs  so plan on applying three to four light coats instead of one big thick one. maintain a consistent speed as you spray without slowing down  which can cause build ups  or speeding up  which will result in an uneven coat. don t worry if the first coat appears blotchy despite your consistent speed  since the following coats will correct this.  again  always refer to directions since drying times between products may vary  with some advising a 20 minute wait for each coat to dry  while others advise two hours.then sand the wood down with p320 grit paper to smooth the finish. wipe the wood down with a tack cloth to remove the dust and wait for any particles in the air to settle before continuing with the next coat.you can also use 0000 steel wool instead of sandpaper.    first  if you re using a spray gun  follow the gun s directions regarding cleaning  since some may require you to clean it in between each coat if you are using a water based lacquer.also  a different ratio of thinner to lacquer than you used for your first coat may be recommended for additional coats. apply three more coats  sanding after each one. after your last coat  buff it with p400 grit sandpaper dampened with mineral spirits  then finish with 0000 steel wool.

How do you paint mason jars with acrylic paint?  clean and thoroughly dry the jar before proceeding.    spray paint is the easiest to use  as you don t have to struggle trying to get a paintbrush into every nook and cranny. choose any color you like. metallics look especially amazing with mason jars but any color will work well  even black if that s the look you re wanting.   cover your work surface with box cardboard and always work in a well ventilated area to prevent harm from the fumes.    this will prevent stray paint from marking it.    spray carefully and keep it even. move the jar around as you spray  to ensure full coverage.    tiny shells  fake flowers  sand  and beads can be used to decorate the external part of the jar.   consider deciding on a pattern before adding the decorations. it can be helpful to draw the design on paper  to remind you where the items go.    use hot glue  as it will hold the items in place better. maybe put more decorations near the base of the jar  and thin them out near the top.    real ones will need water  which may end up damaging the paint. or even put in a bunch of twigs  incense sticks or other items  depending on what you want to display.    or give it to someone as a gift.    clean and thoroughly dry the jar before proceeding.    this might be one color or two  depending on whether or not you wish to make divisions on the jar  such as one color from the top to the middle  and another color from the middle to the base . alternatively  you can paint the entire jar  then paint on additional designs in a pattern or random formation  such as spots or love hearts.   the paint must be suitable for glass surfaces. spray paint is recommended  as it s easy to apply and goes on evenly. spray paint is used for this tutorial.    be sure the place you re spraying the jars in is well ventilated  to prevent you from breathing in toxic fumes.    if doing more than one jar  add the other jar or jars at even intervals across the cardboard  for spraying at the same time.   if you re creating stripes  always mask off the areas that are not to be painted the color you re spraying each time. this includes the already painted areas  ensure each stripe is fully dry before making the next one.    don t get too close or there is a risk of causing the paint to drip  leaving drip marks on the jar s surface. spray evenly.    follow the spray paint instructions on expected drying times  checking regularly. once you re sure it s dry  additional decorative elements can be painted on  if wished.    here  it s up to your imagination. for example  you might like to tie a ribbon around the mouth of the jar  insert some artificial flowers on the ribbon and hang a little bell off it. rummage around your craft basket for things that don t have other uses  and hang them off the jar as decoration.    clean and thoroughly dry the jar before proceeding.    for example  you might have a rose pink jar with gold glitter  or a silver jar with red glitter. try to avoid the exact same paint color with the same glitter color  as the glitter will tend to be overwhelmed by the paint color  use variant shades of the same color if you want the same color theme  preferring the paint in the paler hue and the glitter in the brighter or darker hue. the exception to this is metallic paints with the same metallic glitter color  these tend to look terrific.   choose high quality craft glitter for the best effects. the paint must be suitable for glass surfaces. spray paint is recommended  as it s easy to apply and goes on evenly.    be sure the place you re spraying the jars in is well ventilated  to prevent you from breathing in toxic fumes.    if doing more than one jar  add the other jar or jars at even intervals across the cardboard  for spraying at the same time.    don t get too close or there is a risk of causing the paint to drip  leaving drip marks on the jar s surface. spray evenly.    follow the spray paint instructions on expected drying times  checking regularly. once you re sure it s dry  you can proceed.    this is the line from which the glitter will go down to the base of the jar  or from an area to the top of the jar . around a quarter to halfway up from the base is recommended. place a row of tape around where this line begins  to mark the spot.    sprinkle glitter right around this row or circle.    you can t mod podge the entirety of the base  or top  section because the mod podge dries out too quickly to allow the glitter to stick. just work through it methodically and you ll get there.    this allows it to set properly.    let this dry for another hour.    the glitter and paint jar is now ready for use. it can be used to hold flowers  pens and pencils  lollipops  trinkets  etc. in fact  whatever you like really.    clean and thoroughly dry the jar before proceeding.    the best size is one that covers the jar fully and is neither too small  nor too large. if it is too small  perhaps join two doilies together.   if you have to cut the doilies  do so with great care. use mod podge or clear nail polish to seal the cut edges of the doily to prevent fraying while working with it.   nan  take care to smooth out wrinkles or bumps as you go. allow to dry in place.    this will seal it and help keep it clean during use. allow to dry.    tie a thin ribbon or a length of burlap around the neck of the jar. you might add something else too  such as a little bell  a small star  a bead or a love heart  made from metal  wood  plastic  glass  etc.  just as a finishing touch.    the jar can be used for storing items  such as pens and pencils  or you can even use it as a lamp. drop a votive candle into the base of the jar  light with a long stick match and see the beautiful patterns the doily makes with the glow of the candle behind it.    clean and thoroughly dry the jar before proceeding.   the jar can be either clear  untouched  or painted for this project  it s up to you.    there are various options  including    wrapping burlap around the entire jar  either in one large piece or in rows placing a large piece of burlap all the way around the middle of the jar  then layering on lace and ribbon and a decorative item creating a design using burlap pieces.    by way of example    cut a wide piece of burlap for the center of the jar. glue in place  making sure the end pieces meet at the end of the jar. match up neatly  and trim off any excess. attach a piece of lace around the center of the burlap piece. again  make the ends meet neatly at the back of the jar and trim off any excess. place a piece of thin satin ribbon around the center of the lace piece. again  make the ends meet neatly at the back of the jar and trim off any excess. if wished  attach a small decoration in the center  such as small dried flowers  a bead  a bow  a key  a love heart  etc. using glue or string.   if wrapping the entire jar in burlap  add the glue in sections and take care to smooth out any wrinkles as you go. if using rows of burlap  add glue for each row as you go.          once dry  the burlap wrapped mason jar is ready to use.    clean and thoroughly dry the jar and lid before proceeding.    choose one that you d like to have on display  or that is your favorite animal. also select some spray paint  in the color of choice. metallic paints look great  but any color is fine.    outside is easiest  plus it s well ventilated. or  set up some cardboard on a bench or the floor in the garage or somewhere else with good ventilation.    allow it to dry thoroughly before proceeding.   spray the entirety of the animal  which includes its underside  as all of the animal will seen when put on display.    use the same color as for the plastic animal  this needs to look seamless.    allow to dry fully.    that s all there is to it  it s now ready for use. of course  you could make several more  to complete your  safari    jungle  or  zoo  display.   nan

How do you clean a fridge with vinegar and baking soda?  place it on a table or counter so the refrigerator is completely emptied out. you will want to have empty space so that you can easily assess what items to sort through.   although most food will be fine when left out for a short period of time  make sure that such food is not left out more than an hour or so. food can reach  the danger zone  in a relatively short period of time. having a cooler can make the process a bit safer for food safety  especially during hot summer months. if you are cleaning out the refrigerator in cold weather  you may be able to put the items outside while you sort at your leisure.    if possible  bag securely to prevent leakage or mold distribution. the yearly or quarterly refrigerator clean often alerts us to items we ve completely forgotten about.   check expiration and  use by  dates. these are indicators that a given item should be cleaned out. throw away items that you are unlikely to use. if no one in the house likes olives  get rid of the jar that has been in the refrigerator since the martini party. empty the bin afterwards to make sure your house doesn t smell of all the food you throw out     in order to get the job done quicker  you ll probably want to remove shelving and the like and place it near the kitchen sink  where it will be much easier to clean.   for a quick clean  you do not necessarily have to take out all shelving. but doing so assures a more in depth clean. usually shelving comes out in a similar fashion to oven racks  or drawers in a bureau.    dish soap will be fine. most of what you took out of your fridge either won t fit or shouldn t be placed in a dishwasher. instead  lather up some suds  get a nice brush or sponge to scrub with  and start going at the removable items from your fridge.   never wash a cold glass shelf with hot water. the sudden temperature change could shatter the glass. instead  use cold water or remove the shelf and let it come up to room temperature before washing it. for heavy duty spills and or stains  don t be afraid to use the power of hot water and ammonia. dilute a little bit of ammonia in hot water  1 5 ratio should be plenty  and let the item s  soak before scrubbing. be sure to let the shelving  and drawers dry out completely on a drying rack before inserting back into the refrigerator.    attack any big or stubborn stains and hit all the remaining surfaces with a clean cloth or sponge.   you probably don t want to use a strongly scented soap or cleaner on the inside of the fridge  as food may absorb the smell. instead  use one of the following natural cleaning solutions   2 tablespoons of baking soda and 1 quart hot water1 part apple cider vinegar to 3 parts hot water   for really stubborn stains or buildups  try using a dab of white toothpaste. it serves as an abrasive cleanser and it smells mighty fine to boot.  if your refrigerator door has shelving space and is regularly used  make sure to hit that area too  either with a chemical cleaner or a gentler one  explanation above .    with a clean cloth  wipe off any excess water from your removable shelving and place it back in the refrigerator.    don t saturate the seal with undiluted bleach as this may ruin the integrity of the gasket. pat the gasket dry and then apply lemon oil  mineral oil  or body lotion on the gasket to keep the rubber supple.    wipe off any jars  bottles  or tupperware and place them back into the refrigerator. double check the expiration dates on any perishable items before placing them back.      pull the refrigerator forward to expose all sides. to avoid scratching your wood floor or tearing linoleum  use an appliance glide when moving your refrigerator. clean the all exterior surfaces using a towel and all purpose cleaner. if your model has the coils mounted on the back of the unit  skip wiping the back until part 3.    for information on your refrigerator s condenser coil location  reference your use and care manual. depending on your refrigerator model  the condenser coils can be located in several places    along the back of the unit  or mounted under the unit and accessed via the rear panel  or in the front of the unit and accessed via the toe grill.    it is important to unplug the refrigerator to prevent electric shock. if your unit is built in or difficult to pull forward  turn off power via your home s breaker box.    be extremely careful not to puncture the coils.   after cleaning the coils with a coil brush  use a vacuum with attached brush to clean up the excess dust and dirt on and around the coils. do not use a cleaning solution on the coils    the fan circulates are across the coils  which aids in releasing excess heat. if the fan blade is obstructed in anyway  the coils will have a hard time releasing heat.   nan nan nan  every three months  remove most or all of your food from the fridge and wipe all the surfaces with a baking soda or vinegar solution. regular maintenance will save you time and energy in the future.   this almost goes without saying  but if you notice a spill or stain in the fridge  try to clean it up quickly and

with regular blasts of bad odors  it s time to act. here s what you can equip your fridge with to combat these smells    a clean sock filled with activated charcoal   from an aquarium store  not from your bbq briquettes. the charcoal absorbs bad odors for up to three months. an opened box of baking soda. baking soda is another excellent odor absorber.most baking soda packages say you should change your baking soda out every 30 days  but you can probably get away with 60 to 90 days of use before exchanging. freshly ground coffee  placed in a small dish at the back of the fridge  also works very well at absorbing odors. unscented chlorophyll cat litter is yet another odor buster. 1 2  kitty litter in a shallow pan at the back of the refrigerator should eliminate most offending smells.    this may not be for everyone  but some people might enjoy the subtle hint of vanilla  for example  when they open their refrigerator. the operating word in this whole step is  subtle.  you probably don t want any fragrance to be overwhelming upon opening of the fridge. like cologne or perfume  a nice  afterthought  is much more pleasant  especially coupled with food    sprinkle a little vanilla extract  tea tree oil  or essence of lavender  lemon  or even bergamot in a cotton ball and place the cotton ball in a small dish at the back of the fridge. exchange every couple of weeks.    a crumpled paper bag works wonders at removing smells in the crisper.

query	229	labrador retriever keep  labs crave company and stimulation  so it is important for you to spend lots of time with your lab and to invest time and energy in training your lab. be honest with yourself about how much time and energy you will be able to invest in your dog.   think about your how much time you spend away from home. if you are often not home due to work or other lifestyle factors  then a lab may not be the ideal pet for you.determine whether you are willing and able to train a dog. labs are easy to train and they enjoy the stimulation. before you decide to get a dog  think realistically about how much time you will be able to devote to training your lab. if you do not plan to train your dog due to time or energy constraints  then a dog may not be the best choice.consider other lifestyle factors. labs are great with kids and other pets as well  so a lab may be a good fit if you have kids and or other pets.    puppies are hard to train and they require lots of time as well. before you decide to get a puppy  think about your lifestyle and the amount of time that you can devote to raising a puppy.   for example  will you be willing to get woken up every couple of hours in the middle of the night if your puppy is crying  will you be able to manage if your puppy chews up one of your favorite pairs of shoes  are you willing to clean up urine and feces accidents during the housetraining process  if not  then consider adopting an adult dog.on the other hand  there are some positives to getting a puppy. training your labrador from a young age creates a fantastic bond between the two of you and you will get to enjoy watching your pet grow and mature.    some of the positives of taking on an adult dog is that they are often already house broken and may even know some basic commands  such as sit and stay. therefore  if you don t have the time or desire to housetrain a dog  then adopting an adult could be the best option for you.one potential downside of an adult dog is he may not be trained  and adult dogs may be harder to train. also  some dogs may not have been well socialized and may get spooked by certain things such as other dogs  strangers  etc. consider whether you have the necessary training skills to correct these problems should you encounter them.  gender is not a big deal unless you already have a dog. if you own a dog already  then getting a dog of the opposite gender will provide the best chance of harmony between your pets.male dogs tend to be a bit more aggressive  but these behaviors can be controlled with training. female dogs often more easygoing  but labs are such a relaxed breed that this doesn t really matter too much. regardless of the gender of your dog  make sure that you spay or neuter the dog unless you intend to breed it.    the labrador s willingness to please makes them easy to train and they make great working dogs. they have many roles in society  ranging from their origins as gun dogs retrieving game  to assistance dogs for the visually impaired.   if you are looking for certain characteristics in a dog for working purposes  then be sure to source a purebred dog from a breeder who raises dogs with the characteristics you require.  the most common lab colors are black  yellow  and chocolate. all colors of labradors are easy to train  but chocolate labradors do have a reputation for being more disobedient than their yellow or black cousins. however  there is much debate among breeders and lab owners about this reputation.keep in mind that all dogs have different personalities and abilities regardless of color  so color choice is more about your personal preference than anything else.  adopting a lab from a shelter or rescue group is a great thing to do  as these dogs are often loving  loyal animals who through no fault of their own have ended up in a rescue. just keep in mind that adopting a lab can mean compromising on little things such as the dog s color  age  or gender.  most dog breeds have fans who work to ensure that special dog breeds  such as labradors  have good homes. check to see if there are any labrador rescue groups in your area with dogs available for adoption.   you may be able to get contact information for local rescue organizations from your local humane society  veterinarian s office  or pet shop. keep in mind that dogs who end up in rescue programs are not there because they are bad. owners may give up their dogs because of life circumstances such as a divorce  job loss  or physical condition. other times a dog may end up in a rescue program because the owner did not fully consider the financial and or time commitment that a dog requires.  if you are nervous about adopting a dog  keep in mind that many adoption agencies offer or even require a trial period for qualified adopters. during the trial period  you will be able to take the dog home for a week to see if you are a good match for each other.even if you do not have to or want to do a trial period  it is important to meet your potential new pet. spend some time with him or her before you decide if this is the dog for you. shelters often have special areas for prospective pet owners and their family members  people and pets  to get to know a potential new member.    it is important to find a responsible breeder in order to get a healthy  well socialized lab. by seeking out a responsible breeder  you can also avoid supporting breeders who do not take good care of their dogs. you can find a responsible breeder by checking with your local american kennel club.try searching the akc directory for a responsible breeder in your area  https   www.apps.akc.org apps clubs search index.cfm     if you decide to go through a breeder  make sure that you visit the breeder and see the pups with the mother. never buy a puppy if you are not allowed to see the mother  no matter what the excuse. puppy mills separate puppies from the mother at a young age  so she doesn t get to nurse them and so that she can get pregnant again.young pups without a mother are a strong indication that you are dealing with a puppy mill. do not encourage this immoral trade by purchasing their pups.    it is a good idea to visit a few different local breeders before deciding who you want to buy your puppy from. do not buy a puppy from the first breeder you visit. you may even want to expand your search outside of your own local area in order to find the best breeder and puppy for your needs.never buy from a breeder online without visiting the breeder s location. if a breeder does not allow you to visit and wants to meet up somewhere else  then this should be a red flag to stay away from this breeder.  never have a puppy shipped. shipping puppies is very stressful on them and often results in a sick  frightened puppy when you pick them up from the airport.    it is a good idea to get to know your potential puppy before you commit. if the breeder does not want you to meet the dog before you commit to buying it  then that should be a warning sign that something is wrong.see how the lab reacts to you. try some basic commands see how he responds. see if the puppy is curious and comes to investigate  this is a good sign  or if he cowers in a corner  this is a sign of timidity . watch how he interacts with the other puppies as well. he should seem playful and energetic.  a puppy that has been raised by a responsible breeder will seem healthy  energetic  and well fed. if the puppy seems lethargic  malnourished  or has other signs of illness like a runny nose  cough  or skin sores  then that will indicate that the puppy is in poor health. do not purchase a puppy from this breeder.  the breeder should be willing to show you the dog s health records including all immunizations  clearances  and guarantees. if you are getting your dog from a breeder  ask to see the papers for the mother and father of the puppy.   be aware that labradors are prone to a number of hereditary diseases which are passed down along the generations. responsible breeders will try to eliminate these diseases  which involves the breeder submitting their breeding stock to genetic tests and radiographs to work out if they are carriers or at risk of transmitting  certain conditions. keep in mind that these tests cost the breeder money  so you will need to pay more for a puppy from screened parents. the payback is that the puppy is less likely to develop serious conditions such as hip dysplasia  elbow dysplasia  or eyesight problems.
