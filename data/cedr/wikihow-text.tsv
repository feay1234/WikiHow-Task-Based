query	1	 before you start overclocking, you ll want to make sure you are running the latest drivers on your video card. you can download the latest drivers from the nvidia or amd site, depending on which manufacturer you have. having the latest drivers will ensure that your card is running as stably as possible. newer drivers often increase overclocking performance as well.  to overclock, you will need a few different programs, all of which are available for free. these programs will give you performance benchmarks, allow you to adjust your card timing and voltage, and monitor temperature performance.   download a benchmark program   there are several available, but one of the quickest and most intuitive is heaven. it is available for free from unigine, the developers. another popular program is 3dmark. download an overclocking program. while both nvidia and amd have overclocking utilities of their own, msi afterburner is one of the most popular and widely used programs. despite it s name, it will work with virtually every graphics card from both nvidia and amd.download a monitoring program. although benchmark and overclocking programs will report temperatures and speeds, sometimes it s good to have another monitor to make sure that all of your settings take. gpu z is a lightweight program that will monitor the temperature, clock speed, memory speed, and every other aspect of your graphics card.    going into your overclocking process without being informed can cost you a lot of time and cause you a lot of headaches later on. you want to find the clock speeds that other users who have your exact same card are getting. you also need to find what is generally considered to be your card s highest safe voltage.   do not immediately apply these numbers to your card. since every card is different, there s no telling what could happen if you enter the wrong numbers. instead, use them as a guide during the overclocking process to judge how effective your numbers are. try forums such as overclock.net to find other overclockers who have the same card that you do. overclocking a laptop s gpu is not recommended. laptops have a much harder time dissipating heat, and overclocking can quickly lead to dangerous temperatures.    you will need to install it after downloading it. most users will be able to leave the settings at their default during installation. once your program is installed, open it to start the benchmarking process.    before you start the benchmarking, you will be able to adjust the graphics settings. adjust them to whatever you would like, and make sure that resolution is set to  desktop . if the benchmark program does not perform well with the settings you pick, you can change them later.    the benchmark program will begin, and after a few moments of loading scenes will begin playing on your monitor. if the performance is poor, you can exit and lower your settings, but this isn t necessary. during the overclocking process, you should see performance improve without having to adjust the settings.    once the scenes start playing, you will see a row of buttons at the top of the screen. click the benchmark button to start the benchmark process. in heaven, this will run through 26 different scenes, and will take several minutes to complete. after the benchmark is over, you will be given a score based on your graphics card s performance.    write down the score that you get. this will help you easily compare results as you increase the speed of your card.    you will see a list of sliders on the left side of the program and a hardware monitor on the right. you can also run gpu z now to have an additional monitor to verify readings.    this slider controls the core clock speed of your gpu. if your card has a shader clock slider, make sure that it is linked to the core clock slider. you will see a link icon between the two if they are linked.    when making adjustments to the speed of your clock for the first time, it is always advisable to go by small amounts, such as 10mhz. this amount allows you to see improvements, but not accidentally go overboard.    the changes should take effect immediately. look at your readings in gpu z to ensure that the new speed is showing.    once you ve made your first adjustment and verified it, it s time to run the benchmark program again and get your new score. when the benchmark program is running, pay attention to see if image quality or frame rate improves noticeably from the first time.   if the benchmark program runs without any issue, then your overclock is stable so far and you can continue.    continue raising your speed in 10mhz intervals, checking the results in the benchmark program each time. sooner or later, you ll start running into instabilities.   instabilities will manifest as black screens, graphical glitches, artifacts, bad colors, blotches, and more.    once you hit an instability, you can either revert your settings to the last speed that was working well, or you can try increasing your voltage. if you ve seen noticeable improvements, or you don t want to risk damaging your card due to increasing the power flow, revert to the last working speed and skip down to part five. if you want to keep pushing your card, leave the speed as it is and move on to the next section.    the core voltage sliders is locked by default to prevent accidental damage to your card. this alone should tell you how potentially serious doing this is. check the  unlock voltage control  box in the general tab and click ok.    you will unlikely be able to select exactly 10mv, as voltages can only be increased by set amounts. click apply.    once you ve increased your voltage, run your benchmarking program to see if your overclock is stable now. remember, you left your settings at a speed that was unstable, so if it is stable now after raising your voltage you can go back to increasing your clock speed.    if your overclock is stable now, start raising the core clock speed in 10mhz intervals again, running benchmarks each time. repeat this until you reach the next instability.    as voltage increases, the temperature of your gpu will start to go up. as you continue the process of increasing your voltage, keep an eye on your temperature readings in gpu z. it s recommended to keep temperatures below 90  c  194  f , but many enthusiasts prefer to keep it even cooler, such as 80  and below.   improving your case s and card s cooling can help you increase your overclocking capabilities, but can be expensive and time consuming.    once you reach your next plateau, raise the core voltage by 10mv again. benchmark, and then repeat the core clock process. remember to keep watching your temperature, as this will be one of the big limiting factors in how far you can take the overclock.    remember the notes you took about your card earlier  make sure that you don t exceed the safe voltage limit for your card when you are making your adjustments.    at a certain point, your overclock will stop being effective. you may reach your temperature threshold, your maximum voltage, or your clock speeds may just not be stable no matter how much your voltage increases. if that s the case then you can move on to the next step.    once you ve hit the limit with your core clock, it s time to do the same with your memory clock. repeat the process by raising the memory clock in 10mhz intervals, raising the voltage when you hit instabilities  if you haven t maxed out your safe voltage or temperature yet .   make sure to keep running the benchmark after each adjustment. raising the memory clock can lead to increases, but at a certain point it will actually start hurting performance. pay attention to your benchmark scores to get it just right.    the process for overclocking sli cards is pretty much the same as a single card. each card needs to be overclocked individually, and the slower card will always dictate the overall speed. since no two cards are the same, one of your cards will be held back a little by the other. follow the above steps to overclock each individual card.    performing your stress test is going to take a significant amount of time, so make sure you aren t going to need your computer for the next few hours. it s a fairly hands off process, but you ll want to be able to check in and evaluate performance.    instead of starting the  benchmark  process in heaven, click run and just let it go. heaven will continue to cycle through the scenes until you tell it otherwise.    as the scenes continue to play, keep your eyes open for any glitches, artifacts, or full on crashes. these indicate an unstable overclock, and you ll need to go back and lower your settings. if you make it through the stress test without issue  4 5 hours , then it s game time.    benchmark programs are great, but they aren t the reason you re overclocking  the games are. open up your favorite game and test out the performance. your old settings should work much better, and you may be able to crank them up to something higher 
query	2	 anyone can start off in bodybuilding, but we all have different reasons. for example,  markus ruhl ,  the german giant , and  the bodybuilding freak , as his fans called him. try to create reasonable goals.   whatever the reason why you decide as a bodybuilding beginner to start  lose fat, gain weight, build muscle, become a fitness model, become a professional bodybuilder, or just get in shape  you have to determine your goal before you start your journey as a bodybuilding beginner, whether you are a female bodybuilder beginner or male beginner because it will be much easier for you to achieve it and maybe it inspires you to a higher goal.    ask yourself what is better for you. if you are a beginner female bodybuilder or a male beginner, train in a gym full of big muscle bodybuilders or train in a gym that has personal trainer who will help you to achieve your goal.    only 10  can survive and achieve their goals. imagine a beginner female bodybuilder, will she succeed if she trained without any help  of course not, but not everyone can pay for this personal trainer quite so quickly. that s why the training partner is so important. especially for bodybuilding beginner. take your friend who has the same goal to train with you or you can find a lot of training partners in the gym. you choose what happens. the point is your training partner will give the support and motivation you need to achieve your goal.    many gyms offer the services of a personal trainer who can access you and tell you your body type , what kind of food you have to eat and advise a training plan that will match your goals .   also you have to ask your doctor about your diet and tell him about the bodybuilding training program you will start to have all the benefits from both sides, especially for a beginner female bodybuilder, because she needs very special care .      gather as much information as you can about a lot of topics which are very important and related to your goals such as nutrition and how it effect your progress, body types and what kind of nutrition suitable for yours , bodybuilding supplements and how and when you can take some. find bodybuilding training program for you according to your goal ,and your body type and as a beginner female bodybuilder or beginners male bodybuilder. all this knowledge will help you to achieve your goal and will teach you how to develop it.      90  of bodybuilding beginners go down in this trick called high hopes.everyone wants to go to the gym today and wake up next morning yoked like arnold and after a few months of training he feels disappointed and stops or he starts take some supplements to gain muscle fast and that is very dangerous especially for bodybuilding beginners male, and also for beginner female bodybuilder if she failed to get what she want fast, lose fat for example, she gets disappointed and stops training. be patient, train hard and you will get what you want.   nan  and it s more important in bodybuilding. bodybuilding beginner like anyone of us eats just 3 meals a day while when he start bodybuilding this number must increase to 6 or 7 meals a day according to his weight , his training program , his body type ....etc. to succeed in this challenge , first ask your doctor what is the best diet to you depend on the above mentioned elements . second , divided your meal from 3 big meals to 6 or 7 small meals then go to the next level as a bodybuilding beginner you will face some difficulty but after while your body will handle this challenge. do your best to succeed.    injuries are a common problem with any type of athlete but is highly prevalent in the bodybuilding community due to the physical and psychological stress placed on the body. injuries can cause you to lose the gains you have made, cause you to miss workouts, lead to poor sleeping habits, and even end a promising career so my advice to every bodybuilding beginner be patient, train hard and take care of your body and you will win this challenge.    as a bodybuilding beginner you have to motivate yourself all the time until you reach your target, because if you lose your motive, you will lose the road to the end line your target    it s one of the most powerful tools all bodybuilding beginner have to use , keep a record to your progress and make notes it will help you to achieve your target as soon as it possible by controlling any mistakes or less motivation may happen and it keep you in the track until you achieve your goals     food guide       food scale       fat clipper       gym bag        
query	3	 brainstorming involves throwing out ideas, then reflecting on and building on those ideas in order to create even more ideas. allow 30 to 60 minutes for brainstorming, using the following technique    specify the problem that you will focus on. commit to withholding judgment. volunteer anything and everything that comes to mind regarding the problem, no matter how unrealistic it may seem. avoid immediate analysis of ideas you come up with during the brainstorming session. you can filter through the useful and useless information later in the decision making process, but during the brainstorming, it is important to allow a free flow of ideas.    you can invite others into a brainstorming session, or garner contributions in the following ways    hold a meeting. this method is more rigid than brainstorming, as it requires that you develop an itinerary and instruct team members to contribute ideas during the meeting. hand out questionnaires. the advantage to this technique is that people may feel free to contribute an alternative perspective without fear of judgment. have conversations with people. when you share the problem with other people, you not only get other viewpoints, but your own thinking is also catalyzed into action. try talking with a friend, a mentor, someone completely unrelated to the problem or even a child to gain access to new perspectives outside of your own.    just imaging you are making a decision from a different viewpoint can provide you with new perspective. for example, if you are a sales person choosing between 3 different marketing campaigns, try imagining the decision making process from the point of view of an accountant, or even a customer.    repeating the same scenario over and again in your head may only lead to the same perspective. to develop alternative perspectives, try rewording the issue at hand. for example, if you are faced with deciding how to seat students in a classroom and are stuck on the phrase,  how to create a seating chart,  then it may be beneficial to reword the problem as,  why the seating chart is needed,  or,  the benefits i hope to gain from creating a seating chart.     imagine you are being tasked with creating the problem, rather than solving it. for example, if you must make a decision on how to clean a floor, then imagine how you might mess up a floor in order to identify new approaches to cleaning it.    viewing a decision from different surroundings may alter your thought process and perspective.    write down, recite out loud, construct 3 dimensional models and or physically reenact thoughts and ideas that come to you while envisioning alternative perspectives in order to build on those ideas and stimulate your ability to create new ones.    include works of non fiction and fiction in order to gain new perspectives.  
query	4	 many smokers find that they experience cravings whenever they are in situations or places where they smoke most often.if you tend to smoke at parties, bars, or around a particular group of friends, and you want to temper your smoking habits, it may be best to avoid those triggers until a day when you re ready to smoke.   the first step in avoiding triggers is to identify what your triggers are.think about when you most often smoke, and compare that place scenario with your frequency of cravings between cigarettes. if you absolutely cannot avoid your biggest triggers, have a plan in place to avoid smoking on  off  days. give yourself permission to leave early if necessary, and arm yourself with distractions to keep you from smoking.    one of the best ways to avoid giving in to your cravings, especially if you find yourself in places or situations that trigger the urge to smoke, is to give yourself adequate distractions. for some, that may mean something to satisfy an oral fixation. for others, it may require something to keep the hands busy.identify what activities suppress your cravings most effectively. do you feel the need to put something in your mouth, hold something in your hand, or some combination of the two if you crave the oral fixation that comes with smoking, try chewing gum or sucking on a hard candy or lozenge. some smokers also find it very satisfying to chew on something crunchy, like sunflower seeds, to help stave off a nicotine craving.if you find yourself craving something to do with your hands, try carrying a pen and paper around. you can twirl the pen between your fingers, or doodle draw to help distract you from the cravings.if you feel you need both the hand occupation and oral fixation, try carrying around a bundle of toothpicks tea tree sticks, straws, or lollipops. many former smokers  and current smokers who cannot smoke, for example while at work  turn to toothpicks, straws, and lollipops as a means of satisfying both the behavioral and oral components of cigarette cravings.  if you find yourself absolutely craving a cigarette on a day you don t want to smoke, promise yourself you ll wait 10 minutes before reaching for a pack. in that time, do something distracting. try going for a walk or reading something engrossing to distract your mind, and use a physical replacement  like a toothpick or lollipop  to satisfy the habitual components of smoking. you can also squeeze a stress ball to help manage any anxiety that accompanies your cravings.if you absolutely must give in to your craving, then you may want to subtract that cigarette from a day you were planning to allow yourself to smoke later in the week. for example, if you re too stressed out on a wednesday at work and you give in to your craving, then skip the situations or groups of friends who would trigger a craving on friday or saturday. that way you re still keeping yourself below a weekly minimum.    if you find your social smoking habits turning into bad cravings whenever you re stressed, try using relaxation techniques to break your stress patterns. there are many relaxation techniques that smokers find useful, including deep breathing, meditation, muscle relaxation, and yoga.in deep breathing, the goal is to breathe from your diaphragm  below your rib cage  to produce a slow, steady, deep inhalation and exhalation.meditation is used to calm the mind and focus attention away from stressful thoughts and feelings. most people who meditate begin by focusing on their breath, taking slow and deep breaths in and out. some practitioners also use a repeated word or phrase  called a mantra  or practice visualization to imagine a place or time that is peaceful and serene.progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and subsequently relaxing each group of muscles progressively, from one end of the body to the other. this can help alleviate muscle tension and quell stressful or anxious thoughts and feelings.yoga combines stretches and postures with controlled, meditative breathing to help relax the mind and body.  studies have shown that 30 minutes of moderate to intense physical activity can actually quell a nicotine craving.if you re able to get outside when a craving strikes, go for a run, a long walk, or a bike ride. if you re at work, try some low intensity workout options like squats, lunges, pushups, or walking up down several flights of stairs.  nicotine replacement therapy, or nrt, is widely considered a successful means of dealing with intense cravings.there are many over the counter nrt products available, and according to a decades long study by the food and drug administration, combining nrt products shows no significant health threat.nicotine replacement patches, nicotine gum, and nicotine lozenges are all common nrt products that have been shown to be effective in treating nicotine cravings.stronger nrt products are available with a doctor s prescription. these include medications, such as bupropion  zyban  and varenicline  chantix .unlike over the counter nrt products, these prescription medications are best used on their own, rather than in combination with other products, unless your doctor gives you express approval to combine nrt products. talk to your doctor if you think prescription strength nrt products may be right for you.    whether you re trying to quit altogether, or just trying to break a too frequent smoking habit down into what you view as a more manageable social habit, having a support system can be a valuable aid. if you know of other friends or relatives who are going through the same withdrawal cravings, call or text one another, or get together to go for a long walk or run. if you don t know anyone who s actively trying to quit or reduce their smoking frequency, you can join an online support group.find online support groups by searching online for smoke cessation support groups. many long term members have gone through what you re going through, and can likely offer support or advice on how to manage your cravings.  e cigarettes, also called vape pens, are a non combustible alternative to smoking cigarettes. these products typically contain a flavor component and nicotine, although some e cigarette cartridges also come in nicotine free varieties.while e cigarettes are not necessarily safe, they do allow smokers to avoid inhaling actual smoke while managing  and, ideally, reducing  the amount of nicotine being consumed on a day to day basis.  if you re having a hard time breaking your nicotine habit, it may be helpful to go to public places, such as restaurants and certain parks, where smoking is prohibited. being around other non smokers may be inspiring, and if nothing else you know that you will be incapable of lighting up while you re in that location.  it s okay if you slip up once in a while and smoke on an  off  day. but it s important to recognize that this is akin to taking a cheat day on a diet. you can t keep indulging day after day if you want to avoid becoming a chain smoker. the important thing is to absolutely cut yourself off after one single cigarette, if you must have one.try reinforcing your own imposed limit by only carrying one or two single cigarettes on you at any given time. you can store it in a hard box cigarette pack that is otherwise empty, or purchase a small metal cigarette case. an even better strategy would be to avoid bringing cigarettes with you when you leave the house on  off  days. that way, if you do submit to your cravings, you know you ll only be able to smoke a cigarette if someone is willing to give you one of theirs.    tobacco contains many, many chemicals, the most addictive of which is nicotine. nicotine has been shown to be as addictive a drug as heroin or cocaine.low levels of nicotine consumption create a slightly euphoric feeling due to the release of dopamine and the minor adrenaline rush that accompanies the act of smoking. nicotine also increases the resting heart rate, lowers skin temperatures, and reduces blood flow in the body s extremities.smoking is known to cause cancer, as well as strokes, coronary heart disease, blood clots, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  copd . it has also been shown to harm virtually every organ in the body.smoking is highly addictive. many people recognize the harmful effects smoking causes on the body, but are incapable of quitting.  many self avowed social smokers claim that they are not addicted, and can quit any time they want. however, on a chemical level, even social smokers  brains become sensitized to nicotine. brain scans have shown an increase in the development and density of dendrites in the parts of the brain associated with addiction.studies have shown that even beginner smokers experience a drastic reduction in the number of days they can go through without experiencing cravings, which suggests that even casual social smoking is often the beginning of full fledged addiction.  if you still consider yourself a social casual smoker without any real risk of addiction, you may already be addicted. psychologists and medical professionals have compiled a checklist that addresses smoking habits which may be useful in assessing your own smoking habits. any  yes  answers to any of the following questions suggests to medical professionals that addiction has already started    have you ever tried to quit but could not do you find yourself smoking because it is difficult to quit do you now or have you ever felt like you were addicted to tobacco nicotine do you ever experience strong, irresistible cravings to smoke have you ever felt that you desperately needed a cigarette do you find it difficult to refrain from smoking in places or situations where you know you re not supposed to smoke when you haven t smoked for a few days, do you find it difficult to concentrate after not smoking for a while, do you feel more irritable after not smoking for a while, do you feel an urgent need to smoke when you haven t smoked for a few days, do you ever feel nervous, restless, or anxious   if you re concerned about your level or frequency of smoking, or if you ve tried to quit several times and haven t been successful, you may want to consider talking to your doctor. a medical professional will be able to help you develop a treatment plan to manage both the physical and behavioral aspects of your addiction dependence, and such treatment plans are often highly successful.

query	6	 therefore, you should choose a color that works well with your natural color. the usual options are a lighter shade of brown, a shade of red auburn, or a shade of blonde.there are two types of ombre  traditional, and reverse. the traditional ombre has a lighter color at the tips of your hair than at the roots, while a reverse ombre has darker tips and lighter roots. select a shade that is no more than two shades lighter than your existing hair color. the more subtle the color change, the more natural and sun kissed your hair will appear. whenever possible, look for mild or all natural dyes that will be less damaging to your hair.    equally important as the color selection is choosing where your natural color and dyed color will meet. the lower down your hair the two meet, the safer your look will be. if the two colors meet too high, you run the risk of looking like you have grown out roots, rather than a beautiful ombre.ombre hair is more suitable for those with longer hair, as this makes you less likely to look like you have grown out roots. the longer the hair, the further down the ombre can begin to work its contrast. in general, the jawline is a good place to have the two tones meet.    make sure that there are no tangles left in your hair. this step will make applying the bleach easier, but it will also help you to make sure that your hair will be evenly colored.  there is a good chance that you will get bleach or dye onto your clothes during the process. an artist or styling smock should help prevent this, though. if you do not have a smock to throw on, change into an old t shirt that you can get dirty.    gloves generally come with a dye kit but if they don t, you can simply use normal rubber, vinyl, or latex gloves. remember that it is very important to wear gloves when dyeing or bleaching your hair.   if you do not use gloves, you can end up dyeing or bleaching your hands in addition to your hair. the bleach can also irritate your skin, causing a burning sensation.    unless you are doing a reverse ombre, you will need to use bleach to lift the color from your hair. there is the option of using blonde hair dye   which is safer on your strands   but it doesn t lift as much color so your end result will be much more subtle.   developer comes in 10, 20, 30, and 40 volumes. however, you should not need 30 or 40 volumes to achieve an ombre look. the easiest and cheapest at home bleach method is to use equal parts of 20 volume peroxide and powdered bleach. mix 2oz each of the 20 volume peroxide and powder until they are completely combined into a creamy mixture. always mix the bleach in a well ventilated area to avoid inhaling too much of the fumes.    part your hair down the middle so that it is split half and half. then, divide both halves into as many sections as you want. at the very least, you should divide each half into half again, splitting your hair into quarters.if your hair is long and or thick, you may want to divide it into more sections. pin or tie each section off to separate it from the rest. if using clips, always be sure they are non metallic   metals can react with the chemicals you re using on your hair. tease up the hair around the area where you want the ombre to begin. teasing your hair around this area will help prevent a stark line or line of demarcation where you applied the bleach.    if you re using a dye or bleach kit, chances are you were provided with a small brush to apply the bleach. if not, the best option is to use an applicator brush. you can find these are your local beauty supply store.   alternatively, a similar soft, small brush will work well for application. just make sure that you use a brush that you would be okay with tossing out after you are done.    add bleach starting at the ends and working your way up to the desired fade line. don t feel like you need to work fast or to work in large sections  work in such a way that you get all the strands evenly coated with the lightening product.   make sure that you apply the bleach evenly to both sides of your hair. check in the mirror to make sure that the bleach starts at about the same spot on both sides.make sure that you coat all of the hair that you want to bleach. inspect your strands to check for any spots you may have missed   even saturation is key. to avoid a stark line or line of demarcation, apply the bleach using an applicator brush and take vertical strokes down the hair strand, rather than painting the hair in a horizontal motion.    depending on how light you want your hair to be, you will need to let the bleach set for anywhere from 10 45 minutes. to check, remove the bleach from a small strand of your hair after about 10 20 minutes. if you like the shade, remove the rest of the bleach. if you want to go lighter, leave it in and check again in 5 10 minutes.   for a slight change in color, leave the bleach in for only 10 20 minutes. for a more bold change in color, leave the bleach for 40 45 minutes. leaving the bleach in for longer will also help prevent orange or brassy tones.  keeping your gloves on, rinse out the bleach with warm water. then, wash your hair with a sulfate free shampoo. be sure to get out all the bleach, or your hair will continue to lighten. don t condition your hair just yet.    use a towel to dry it off before beginning the coloring process. you may even want to wait for an hour or two to allow your hair to get mostly dry.    divide your hair into its original sections. tie off the ends with elastic bands or hair clips to make your dying job a bit easier. use at least 2 3 sections, or as many more as you need to feel comfortable.   again, use non metallic clips to avoid reactions with the dying chemicals.    gloves generally come with a dye kit but if they don t, you can simply use normal rubber, vinyl, or latex gloves. remember that it is very important to wear gloves when dyeing or bleaching your hair. if you do not, you will end up dyeing or bleaching your hands as well.    most box hair dyes require a bit of measuring and mixing, so follow the instructions and prepare your dye. make sure that you mix your dye in a well ventilated area.    follow the application instructions that came with your hair dye to properly add it to your hair.   if you re dying your hair with a traditional ombre  lighter ends , then apply the hair dye to all the bleached sections of hair and just a bit further up your strands as well. if you re doing a reverse ombre, add the color just up to the color fade line, and then a second heavier coat near the tips  similar to the bleach application . make sure that you coat all of the hair that you want to dye. inspect your strands to check for any spots you may have missed. as with bleach, even saturation with dye is very important.    follow the box instructions to be determine how long you should leave the dye in your hair. wait the recommended amount of time for your hair dye to set. since your hair has been bleached, you probably won t need to leave the dye in for more than ten minutes.    keeping your gloves on, rinse out the dye with warm water. then, wash your hair with a sulfate free shampoo. bleaching coloring your hair can be very damaging, so take the time to use a deep conditioner to help add some moisture back into your locks.    with your hair being a tad fried from the chemical dye, it may be best to allow it to air dry and avoid any hot tools. however, if you re like most of us you ll want to blow dry your hair right away and get it looking back to normal. doing this also allows you to determine if you ve gotten the color you want, or if you need to do some touching up post dye.

query	8	 it is well established that young children are, on average, more adept at acquiring second  and beyond  languages than older teens and adults. the reasons for this, however, are not as clear.   small children tend to excel at picking up spoken languages through simple exposure to them, and some theorize that this skill is lost around the ages of 12 14 as the brain reallocates its precious resources to other, more important areas. essentially, you are likely to have learned to communicate by then, and thus no longer need to expend substantial brain power toward that ability.whether or not changes in the brain make language acquisition more challenging for adults, it is certain that adults tend to be busier, more stressed, and less singularly focused on picking up the language. adults have also picked up a lifetime of assumptions, conventions, perspectives, biases, and habits, all experienced via the native language, that can make developing  communicative competence  in a second language  with its own cultural  baggage   a more arduous task.    with any desired skill, talent, or ability, having a clear goal in mind makes the process of acquiring said competency more manageable. the same holds true for language acquisition.as a teacher, it may benefit your adult students if you help them define a clear, and ideally short term, goal for why they want to learn a particular foreign language. instead of promoting language learning as beneficial in and of itself  even if it is , help them focus on their desire to connect more deeply with a grandparent or be prepared for a long awaited trip abroad. as you help students find their motivation, feed it through targeted tasks. for instance, offer a project that involves interviewing the grandparent in his her native  and the student s second  language. be aware, however, that motivation will vary in intensity class to class, so be prepared to take advantage of high points and offer encouragement during lower ones.    while you have an essential role as the teacher, the students in the class can also be critical to each other s ability to learn a new language. learner to learner interaction tends to help both parties  notice the gap  between their communication in the language and the proper form.offering learner to learner tasks, such as having one student describe a picture in the foreign language to another, who must draw it, can not only be fun but helpful in enabling students to work through gaps in their comprehension. while such tasks need not replace more traditional methods of teaching vocabulary and grammar, this more indirect method of teaching the  nuts and bolts  of a new language does seem to be at least as effective at instilling them in the long run.    however, simply encouraging students to read level appropriate and interesting passages, both in class and at home, can be an effective strategy. this is especially true when the readings are combined with vocabulary building activities. games like bingo, password, and concentration can facilitate  active meaning negotiation,  where task oriented problem solving helps build an  incidental vocabulary    almost, in essence, picking up new words without realizing it.    there are as many ideal ways to learn a new language as there are people wanting to do it. some even say that foreign languages cannot be taught, but only learned, implying that each learner s unique motivations and skills must be prioritized.each time you teach a new student or new class, then, your methods will likely need to adjust in order to have the most impact. be flexible and willing to work with your adult learners, while drawing from a range of theories, strategies, and practical advice.    whether you learned a second language by drills, flashcards, and rote repetition, or by visiting a foreign country for the summer, there is likely a language theory that matches your method. familiarity with the bases of such approaches will help you formulate your teaching strategy for adults.from the time of ancient greece to well into the last century, new languages were almost invariably taught by what is often called the  audio lingual method.  if your high school french class involved a lot of rote learning, repetition, oral and written testing, emphases on grammar and translation, and constant correction by your teacher, you re already familiar with this method. in the last half century or so, a more  so called   natural approach  has become predominant. it tries to replicate the childhood process of acquiring a language through immersion, play and tasks, constant usage in a low pressure environment, and indirect emphases on grammar and vocabulary.    modern  natural  or  immersion  methods encourage leaners to jump right in to the foreign language without the drudgery of vocabulary lists, grammar lessons, and constant repetition. therefore, they are often a more appealing prospect to harried, hurried adult learners.such task based methods are based on the premise that students will naturally  work out  vocabulary and grammar as they interact with the language  and the other students . the struggle to do so, essentially, is part of the learning process. critics, however, say that this leaves too much vital material for the student to address on his or her own, and that the teacher s guiding hand in areas like grammar is vital, even if it can sometimes be less than enthralling.  despite the reputation they ve assumed as  boring,   sterile,  and  outdated,  there is a reason why classic approaches were used almost exclusively for thousands of years. even in the modern world, they can still have a place in the language classroom.   the  audio lingual  emphasis on habit formation, mimicry, memorization, and repetition can provide a clearer sense of the goals, processes, and achievements for some students. likewise, a focus on grammar and translation, guided in the first language, can build essential skills that some adult learners may be keen to acquire.that said, for many adults, traditional methods will feel too much like being back in school as children, and can dissuade them from continuing the process with enthusiasm. this is why variety and flexibility in your teaching methods are essential.  for all the value in understanding theories, learning happens in practice   and usually, through practice. simply put, teaching an adult a foreign language requires not only your mastery of the language as a teacher, but also a clear understanding of your student s background, motivation, goals, learning style, and needs.   holding fast to traditional methods simply because they have been in use for centuries is usually not the answer, nor is tossing all the old ways aside for the new vogue in language education. it is up to you, the teacher, to determine the mix that will work best for your classroom and your student s .  learning a new language can be a stressful experience for many adults, and can make them feel like children struggling to pick up something new. build on the positives of this perspective by enabling your students to have some fun with it.   most adults like to reminisce about their own childhood, or that of their growing   grown children. let them pick a favorite kids  book from one of those times that is available in the foreign language, and read it together in class. it will seem familiar but new, and fun but challenging.listen to songs, even sing songs together in class. use familiar nursery rhymes and lullabyes in the foreign language, along with songs distinct to that language   culture.    most adults will be sympathetic to the experiences of the other students in the class, and want to help each other succeed. and, according to the notions of task based learning discussed in this article, having students learn from each other s successes and mistakes is vital to adult language development.one good paired activity is the aforementioned  information gap  game of having one student describe a picture in the foreign language to another, who must draw it. a similar option is having students do a variation of the old  pass a secret down the line  game, except having them alternate the language in which the sentence is whispered     essentially translating back and forth down the line . even simply encouraging your students to listen to each other carefully as they attempt to solve problems and answer questions can be quite useful. hearing others struggle and succeed provides both consolation and challenge.each student will also naturally  notice the gap  between the response given, how they would have responded, and or the correct response, thereby helping to build confidence and competence.  unlike many child students, adult learners usually have a specific goal in mind for wanting to learn a foreign language. crafting activities that support this goal, and offering related goals and rewards along the way can fuel motivation and a sense of achievement.if your adult student hopes to land in a foreign country and be able to  jump right in,  consider having them watch episodes of a program in that language  without subtitles  , and attempt to summarize what they can from full speed conversations in the foreign tongue.set up a pretend restaurant, for instance, in the classroom. offer simple prizes for the student s  who do best in ordering lunch. adults like to be rewarded for small achievements just as much as children.    no, the adult classroom, just like the child one, cannot be all fun and games. most adults will want it to be a fun experience, but in the end, learning the language is the goal.   some of the traditional methods that have at least partly fallen out of favor may be of more value to adult learners, especially those who are self motivated to learn the language. they will be more willing to copy down verb tables and go through flash card drills.speaking of copying down information, encouraging your students to write down information longhand may be beneficial.  it will also probably be easier to convince adults to do this than their tech savvy kids.  research indicates that handwriting information aids memorization more than typing, as it requires more active participation in the process.
query	9	 mediation has a number of advantages over going to court, and you should know these advantages before proceeding with a court action. some of the advantages of mediation are mediation is less expensive. most mediations end in resolution of all of the issues pertaining to the divorce. mediation is confidential. that means there will be no public record of the conversations that take place in your mediation sessions. mediation lets you come to a resolution of your issues based on what you and your spouse think is a fair solution. therefore, through mediation, you avoid a court imposed solution that may be based on strict legal principles. mediation still gives you the option of seeking the help of a lawyer if you wish. you and your spouse, rather than the court, can control the mediation process, which is not true of the court process. mediation can help you avoid future conflicts with your spouse and can improve present and future communication between the two of you.    while mediation has a list of benefits over going to court for couples involved in a contested case, mediation is not for everyone. there may be instances in which mediation is not the best option for a particular couple, in particular if any of the following apply when there has been domestic violence in the relationship, you may worry that the dynamics of the relationship would be replicated in the mediation sessions. some people may find, in such situations, easier to have a lawyer negotiate on their behalf. the mediator does not have the authority to order either of the parties to do anything. that makes it possible for one party who wants to delay paying support, or delay the proceedings generally, to stall the process.    if you feel that mediation is the best way to resolve your disagreement with your spouse, suggest mediation. your spouse may agree that the benefits of mediation outweigh its costs and may find mediation preferable to having a court resolve your contested case.    if you and your spouse do decide to go ahead with mediation as a way of resolving your dispute, find a mediator. if you are working with an attorney, your attorney can suggest a mediator. if, however, you are representing yourself, you will have to find a divorce mediator.mediator referrals are available on the internet at such websites as www.mediate.com, www.divorcenet.com, and www.nolo.com.you can also contact mediation or family law organizations such as the association for conflict resolution  www.acrnet.org , the american arbitration association  www.adr.org , and the association of family and conciliation courts  www.afccnet.org  for referrals.other places to call for recommendations on finding a mediator include your local community mediation center  ask whether your case is appropriate for low cost community mediation , your local bar association, or your local organization of therapists or financial professionals.you can also search your phone directory for  mediation,   divorce mediation,   dispute resolution,  or related terms.be sure to find a mediator who has experience in divorce cases, as a general or business mediator with no such experience may not be the best option.  once you have received referrals for or found a mediator yourself, call the office of one of the mediators. this first call should give you a good idea of the mediator s style and personality and should help you get an idea of whether or not you want to work with that mediator. you may be asked some basic questions about yourself, your family, and your marriage. some mediators use this call to gather a great deal of basic information while others prefer to gather the most important information at the first meeting.  if you express an interest in moving forward with the mediation, the mediator will schedule your first meeting, which will be attended by both you and your spouse and will normally take place in an office or conference room. the mediator will go over important information with you about the process and ask you to sign a mediation agreement, which will include a statement on keeping the mediation proceedings confidential. the mediator will also use this opportunity to establish a rapport with you and your spouse and make both of you feel comfortable.  at the first meeting, the mediator will ask you and your spouse to make opening statements. the mediator may then ask you some questions about what each of you has said and will try to ensure that everyone is on the same page in terms of what has been said.  after hearing and discussing your opening statements, the mediator will then try to make clear those issues on which you agree and those on which you disagree. you will discuss what work needs to be done to bring yourself and your spouse into agreement on the issues on which you disagree. depending on the nature of the disagreement, there may be additional information that you need to provide at a later meeting  e.g. if you are dealing with a property dispute and you and your spouse agree to sell the property, you will need to know the value of the property  if you do not know that value, you will need to bring that information to the next meeting .  the mediator will help you negotiate an agreement. negotiating an agreement often involves give and take, so you should be open to compromise and you should try to understand and listen to your spouse s point of view. that does not necessarily mean you should agree to everything your spouse asks for but approaching the negotiation with the willingness to compromise and the willingness to understand your spouse s point of view will help you come up with a solution more easily. moreover, if you express a willingness to compromise and to be understanding, your spouse is more likely to do the same.  once negotiations are completed, the mediator or your attorney  if one is representing you  will draw up an agreement, which will be incorporated along with the rest of your divorce paperwork.   the agreement will become part of your divorce judgment and will, therefore, become enforceable by a court. however, court enforcement of mediation agreements is usually not required because couples tend to follow the terms of the agreement  since the mediation process tends to ensure that the parties are comfortable with the terms of the agreement .  if you are intending to contest a divorce, it is likely that you have been served a petition from your spouse. contesting a divorce, in other words, assumes that you disagree with something in that petition and would like to contest it. your petition will give you a certain time limit to file a response. be sure to file your response within that time limit. the clock starts from the day you are served the petition. if you need legal advice on how to file a response, consult an attorney. the response is very important, in particular if you are in disagreement about certain matters with your spouse, so it is in your best interest to have a legal professional review your forms.  the original forms will go to the court, while the 2 copies will be for you and your spouse.  file your forms with the court clerk, who will keep the original forms and return copies to you for your spouse and yourself.  you will have to pay a filing fee when you file your response. ask the court clerk for the possibility of a fee waiver if you cannot afford the filing fee.  serve  i.e. formally deliver  a copy of your response to your spouse. you can have the papers served by mail or in person yourself or by someone else. when serving, ask the server to fill out a proof of service form or fill out a proof of service by mail form at the post office. file this proof of service form with the court clerk when you receive it.  at this stage, you may wish to hire an attorney, who will help you through the various legal stages that are likely to arise in the future. these stages include discovery  the information gathering stages , pre trial hearings, settlement proposals and negotiations between attorneys, and trial.  at the discovery stage, there will be a process of information gathering. this process involves getting information from you, your spouse, and third party witnesses and includes written questions, subpoenas  i.e. written orders to compel a person to give testimony  and depositions  i.e. sworn out of court testimony .  a pre trial motion is a motion before the actual trial of a case. at a pre trial motion, lawyers from both sides of the case meet before a judge to attend to various matters that must be decided before the case goes to trial, such as who can and cannot provide evidence or that certain evidence should not be allowed in court.if you try to contest your divorce in court, there will be a chance for both you and your spouse  represented by your attorneys  to make pre trial motions.  after pre trial motions, there will be a stage when you are offered the opportunity to settle the case with your spouse. by settling the case at this stage, you avoid going to trial. the settlement phase involves proposals and negotiations between the attorneys of the two parties. if you come to an agreement at this stage, the case will be resolved. if you are unable to resolve your differences with your spouse, the case will go to trial.  if you are unable to resolve your differences at the settlement phase, your case will go to trial. at the trial stage, both sides will present witnesses, cross examine the witnesses, and present closing arguments. at the end of the trial, the court will issue a final order that finalizes the divorce.  if you disagree with the trial judge s decision, you will have the opportunity to appeal that decision.appealing a decision can involve a legally complex procedure, and it is, therefore, in your best interest to seek legal advice from your attorney about the appeals process.

query	11	 with the possible exception of mel brook s space balls, which took aim almost exclusively at star wars,  a mega hit that almost everyone has seen , almost all great spoofs cast their net widely. it is no mistake that brook s other films hit bigger targets like monster movies  young frankenstein , westerns  blazing saddles  and historical epics  history of the world pt. 1 . the master of spoof and parody understood that the more people feel included, and the more people understand broader references, the funnier the film will be.   movies and genres that tend to take themselves very seriously tend to be the best targets of satire. generally, the more a movie or genre tries to avoid humor, the riper it is for making fun of.genre movies are those with similar plots    any type of movie you ve seen 10 versions of, like slasher films, romantic comedies, sports films, etc.    a great spoof pays attention to the  original  and uses it as the jumping off point for the screenplay, and you need to do your research. watch both the movies and any other related spoofs, noting what they find humor in and where things are ripe for joking. some things to pay attention to are recurring character types  is the cast usually a variation on the same 3 characters  if so, you ll need to include parody versions of them, too.  common cliches and story arcs  are their plot moments, lines, or shots that every single movie has in common  how can you subvert them to make them funny   themes or issues of the genre  what does the movie seem to address  is it over the top action and adrenaline in cop movies  spoofed in the other guys , or self righteous documentaries   spoofed in the series documentary now   .     there are few movies without plot holes, and most things you re spoofing will be full of them. instead of shying away, expose these plot holes to comical extremes, pointing out places the  original  film got a little too ahead of itself. again, remember that broader plots  like how horror movie characters always want to  split up   are easier to spoof than one plot point in one specific movie. most spoofs basically steal the common plot structure from the movie they parody, using this as the framework to make jokes from.   having the characters acknowledge the issue or problem, or have one character in particular who jokes about the plot hole  like the stoner in house in the woods .  forcing  the plot on the characters, for example, the character accidentally becomes the classic hero or saves the day, despite trying not to be involved  or not trying at all . resolve the plot holes in a ridiculous way  blazing saddles does this with great skill , or simply cut to the aftermath of the big moment without explaining how everyone made it through, like anchorman s quick turnaround on will ferrell cleaning up and putting on a fresh suit in under two seconds.    one of the best examples of this  spoiler alert   is in the medieval spoof monty python and the holy grail, where the film ends with king arthur and his knights getting arrested by modern day cops in the midst of an enormous battle    it turns out the whole movie is just adults playing violent dress up. surprise is at the root of all comedy, and spoofs are the perfect place for a surprise    your audience knows what plot point or reveal is expected based on the original movie or genre. shake it up    inverted characters are always a great spoof tactic   from bumbling  expert  cops in the naked gun to the intelligent, kickass sidekick in the green hornet remake.    this is spinal tap, a parody of rock documentaries, takes this joke almost literally in the infamous  11  speech, where a guitarist brags that his amp s volume knobs go all the way up to 11, not just 10 like a normal amp. spoofs gain humor by exposing how ridiculous the ideas and plots of movies really are, and how far off they are from the real world.    the greatest parodies, almost without fail, still manage to respect and honor the movies they are spoofing. the do this by remembering what made the movies so special and worth of parody. after all, no one spoofs a movie that no one watched in the first place. this can mean expanding on the themes or the film, like in sean of the dead, or simply picking out the most popular elements and playing them up highly, like in austin power.sean of the dead begins the film with a zombie like walk to and from work, then repeats the same shot after a zombie infestation occurs. the main character doesn t notice anything different the second time, a comical moment that reinforces the idea that we re all zombies sometimes    an important theme that plays out up until the very ending.  austin powers follows a typical spy plot, but its longevity comes from its recognition of what makes the spy movies so fun    traveling the globe, crazy fashion and gadgets, and lots of beautiful women.    in comedy, the straight man is the person who most represents the viewer. they are the only ones who seem to realize how insane or crazy things are around them, which makes the craziness and spoofing around them all the funnier. think of simon pegg s tightly wound cop in the police parody  hot fuzz,  or michael bluth  in arrested development. while a bit of an advanced skill, peppering in the  voice of reason  will make all of the ridiculous stuff sound normal by comparison.   the straight man can be a parody as well, and it is usually best when they are    the main character of airplane  is a war pilot coming back to face  calm  normal life as a civilian pilot. but, if you ve seen any disaster movie ever, you know it won t be so easy.  a funny spoof needs to be a funny movie all on its own, and constant references to other films will get old fast. let yourself cut loose and just be funny, even if the joke doesn t have a  cousin  in the real movies. open, original jokes will make the film feel less like a rip off, or one of those widely panned spoofs where every joke is simply a reference to things that happen in other movies.   use your references to add a layer of humor, not to supply all the jokes. check austin powers, for example. dr. evil is a great parody of common spy villains, but things like his relationship with his less evil son transcend parody to become great family comedy in any movie. this makes the son s turn towards evil even funnier later on, as the parody aspects come full circle. one of the funniest scenes in will ferrel s telenovela parody casa de mi padre is a take on the cowboy singalong, but as the musical continues it veers into wildly different, and hilarious, new territory based on the image of them all singing.  for example, any spoof of the blair witch project should be using hand held camera work to replicate the shaky look of the original. shooting a game of thrones parody  you better have lots of low camera angles on the power players and dramatic, sweeping shots of your location  which can humorously reveal things as you turn the camera .   not all movies have an easily discernible visual style, but they all have common pieces. while romantic comedies are shot in a straightforward manner, you definitely need a  happy music  montage of the couple falling in love. the other idea is to go as far from the actual movie as possible, shooting instead in a comically different location, like the aforementioned ending of the holy grail.     the best spoofs play off of the original movies from script to stage, and your actors are a key factor. show them the characters they are spoofing in their  natural habitat  so they everyone is on the same page. find the major motivation or parody of the character   the pompous hero,   the bumbling sidekick    use these characters as baselines, especially for big moments. instead of starting from scratch on a rakish, sleazy pirate ship captain, you can say  act like han solo, but way creepier and more flirty.     looking at the camera, laughing, or acknowledging that this isn t how things normally are is called  breaking the 4th wall.  you re basically reminding everyone that they re watching a movie, which can work in small doses  see the film noir spoof kiss kiss, bang bang for a wonderful example , but most jokes should be told  straight.  that means your actors accept the lines and events as if they were real life. to your characters, the world they live in is the only world they know, no matter how wacky.   check leslie nielsen, star of famous spoofs from  airplane   to  the naked gun  for a masterclass in straight faced comedy.  it may seem counter intuitive to ape the movie you re making fun of, but this level of detail will make the jokes far funnier. great spoofs could, at quick glance, be the very movies they are making fun of. this sucks the audience in. the surprise of your twists and jokes are much funnier because they are juxtaposed against a more  serious  backdrop.    the tv show community s now famous action movie spoof,  modern warfare,  had more visual jokes than most full length spoofs. from the general, such as a trickle of green paint sliding ominously down the wall  spoofing blood  to a character s slow mo dives, flips, and machine gun fire calling up images of the matrix and scarface. an attention to visual humor will wring out a lot of laughs.   adjust and play with your props. making a fantasy spoof  try changing the emblems on the shields or coat of arms to something ridiculous or funny.don t be afraid to  steal  famous shots and do something funny with them.  airplane   begins with the plane cutting through the clouds set to the music from jaws, re creating the shot in a new light.  this seems counter intuitive, but remember the old rule of  tragedy   time   comedy.  if you put your characters in somewhat legitimate danger, introduce real consequences, and live in the world you re spoofing, then it will be that much funnier when everything blows up in the character s faces. a good spoof still respects and pays attention to the classics, and is a better movie for it.   while any movie in this article could fit this step, sean of the dead is a particularly good example. it actually owns up the horror elements in a few key scenes, playing like a traditional zombie movie, which leads to an enormously funny and satisfying payoff in the end.  comedy, in general, is a quick moving art form, as surprise and speed are key to getting laughs and stringing them together. spoofs are often even faster because

query	21	 if you are able to choose your own play, pick something easy and something you might already be familiar with to start. most editions will have a brief synopsis printed on the back cover. if the play sounds intriguing, it might make for a good selection.   romeo and juliet is often a good starting point because many of us are familiar with the  star crossed lovers  plot. consider a comedy, like taming of the shrew, a play which has been adapted to film for modern audiences. macbeth is another popular shakespearean tragedy, and if you are interested in political intrigue, this might be the play for you.    there are two major choices to make. the first choice is between texts that have been modernized to smooth over the differences in language use from shakespeare s time to our own time, or texts that have not been modernized. the second choice is between texts that are annotated or non annotated. annotated texts may provide definitions, context, and value added information that will help you to form a deeper understanding of what is going on in the play.   the  no fear shakespeare  series is a good option that offers the original text side by side with modernized text. remember that modernized text should support understanding, and not replace the original. popular annotated versions are available by arden and oxford. non annotated texts will provide just the text as it was originally written.    when in doubt, use the context of the sentence to figure out the meaning or reference an online shakespearean glossary. here are some examples     thee  as  you.  for example   when will i see thee next    thou  as  you.  for example   thou art a villain.   thy as  your.  for example   thy name is more hateful than thy face.   hath  as  has.  for example   he hath killed many a man.  or  he hath a horse.  in shakespeare s writing, parts of speech are frequently switched and  normal  sentence order is often varied, often for the sake of rhyme or meter  which is like rhythm . shakespeare often played with standard language  some common features include    nouns or adjectives used as verbs verbs and subjects which don t agree omitted or implied words word endings such as   ly  applied inconsistently tricky sentence construction.  for instance, where we say  john caught the ball,  shakespeare might write  john the ball caught,  or even  the ball john caught.   in shakespeare s writing, metaphors and similes may make some passages more difficult to understand. shakespeare also heavily used puns, double meanings, and malapropisms for comedic effect.   an example of a shakespearean metaphor compares life to the theatre stage   all the world s a stage, and all the men and women merely players. they have their exits and their entrances  and one man in his time plays many parts.  an example of a shakespearean pun  after hamlet has killed polonius and hidden his body, the king asks him where polonius is. hamlet tells him he is at supper    not where he eats, but where he is eaten,  meaning that polonius is the supper   for worms. an example of a shakespearean malapropism  officer dogberry said,  our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two auspicious persons   apprehended two suspicious persons .  gather reference resources that you can refer to if you have a question about something you have just read. here are a few examples of potential resources.   a dictionary a tablet to easily access internet reference material links to websites that will help you understand the language. for example  early english grammar sheets  http   homepages.wmich.edu  cooneys tchg lit adv shak.gram.html , shakespeare s language  http   www.bardweb.net language.html , and pronunciation  http   www.renfaire.com language pronunciation.html .  before you start, set aside some time in a quiet area. move through the text slowly, and don t be afraid to use your dictionary or reference materials if you are lost or confused.    you can make your notes on a separate sheet of paper, where you can write general thoughts, questions, or important ideas or plot points. if you own the text, you might want to consider highlighting key phrases or writing notes in pencil in the book. also, consider the following questions.   what are the important main events  which characters are involved in the sub plot and how does the sub plot relate to the chief plot  what is the relationship of characters to each other  what motivates the characters  what is the central point or lesson of the play   do not be discouraged if you must re read passages several times. even literary scholars often return to key lines. each time you read a passage you will gain a deeper understanding of what is going on in the play.  remember that reading the play you ve chosen should be fun. push on through and keep reading. don t let outdated language or references stop you from enjoying the play.    when you are finished with a section, take out a fresh sheet of paper and take some more notes.   write a summary of each scene or act. record questions or thoughts you may have about the scene. record any new words, phrases, and their definitions that you looked up during reading.   discuss the text or an individual scene with your friends. if you are reading on your own, make use of internet discussion boards for feedback. feel free to ask your friends or people on the discussion board the questions that you wrote down in your notes.    shakespeare s plays were written as dramatic literature and were meant to be performed and heard aloud. as a result, reading the play outloud or performing scenes with friends might give you insight that you would have otherwise missed during a quiet reading.  do this after you ve read the play on your own. if you have finished reading one of shakespeare s more popular plays, there is a very good chance it has been produced into a film. there are also a wide variety of shakespeare s plays on audiobook that you can download to your ipod or another device. but remember, modern plays or film adaptations might give different meaning or be shown in a different context than the original play. think about the below questions when you watch the play or film.   how does the performance compare with your perceptions of the play  was there something the actor provided that you did not consider  was there something you would have done differently   after you are done reading, find a plot summary or synopsis. try to find a synopsis that incorporates passages from the play directly into the discussion. these summaries and synopsis will help correct any misunderstanding that you might have after reading the play. alternately, you can read the synopsis before you ve read the text.

query	24	 before you plan your striptease, you need to find the perfect outer garment. go through your closet, or even take a trip to a sexy garment store, and find something that makes the most of your assets. it could be a conservative suit that leaves a lot to the imagination, or a sexy summer dress. here are some things you should keep in mind as you search for the perfect outfit    pick something that you can easily take off. don t pick something with a thousand unwieldy buttons that will take an hour to remove, or something that s so tight that you need a forklift to remove it from your cleavage. pick something that s sexy, but not so provocative that you leave nothing to the imagination.    your undergarments need to be just as sexy as your actual outfit. pick a bra that makes your cleavage stand out, and tight black underwear or a thong. consider underwear that s lacy or slightly see through.   stockings with garters are a must for a striptease. you can go for classic fishnets, garters with a sexy pattern, or even garters with a racy seam up the back.    choosing a pair of shoes should be simple. the higher and thinner the heel, the better your calves and legs will look. black shoes work best for a strip tease. just make sure that the shoes are something that you can actually walk in. if you bought a new pair for the occasion, break them in a bit first.    your face and hair should look just as sexy as the rest of your outfit. let your hair hang down your back, or pull it in a loose bun that you can unravel during the striptease. your hair should look slightly messy and sexy, but still clean enough for any man to want to run his hands through it.    wear dark shadow that brings out your eyes, black mascara, and a dark red lipstick or lip gloss that makes your lips look luscious and kissable. you don t have to go overboard on the makeup, but you should wear more than you do naturally    stripteases are not an everyday affair.    now that you have your sexy outfit and look, turn down the lights by leaving most of them off, throwing a light scarf over your lamps, or just by lighting a few candles.    whoever heard of a striptease without a chair  pick a chair with a back and one that you can comfortably plant a foot on.    if you want to kick your routine up a notch, turn on some sexy r b, or whatever music gets you in the mood. pick something that won t be too slow or too fast    your striptease will have to keep the pace of the music. if you re playing music, make sure you have enough so that you don t run out of tunes just as you reach the crescendo of your strip tease.    as you get ready to show off your stuff, you have to remove all inhibitions. visualize your sexiest self and prepare to get to work. if you have any doubts about your body or your performance, it ll show on your face the second you step under the spotlights. and if you need a glass of wine or two to work up to it, then hey, who s judging     walk toward your partner by strutting like you re on a cat walk, moving one foot in front of the other with confidence. hold your head high and keep your shoulders back, letting your chest be front and center. keep one hand on your hip.   you can even stop to gyrate your body over the side of a wall before you move toward the center of the stage.    this is not the time to be coy. maintain eye contact whenever you re facing your partner, and don t blush and look away. keep your lips slightly parted, so they look even more sultry. and whatever you do    don t laugh. no matter how silly or out of your comfort zone you feel, nothing will kill the mood faster.   however, you can give just the hint of a sexy smile whenever you re about to do something hot, like remove another article of clothing or caress your breasts.    turn away from the person and take off your top or dress as you continue to move your body. then, turn around while holding the garment and making intense eye contact with the audience. take the garment and gently throw it in your man s direction.   if you re wearing a dress, then skip the next step, but if you just took off a top, then move on to the next stage.    first, gyrate a bit, by moving your hips up and down, and moving your hands up and down the sides of your body, caressing your hips and stomach. then, turn around, bend slightly forward, hook your thumbs into your skirt, and bend with your backside toward your partner as you roll down your skirt.   let your skirt fall to the ground and kick it aside.    move around some more, walking around both sides of the chair, pressing yourself up against the back, and continuing to move up and down while caressing your body. toss your hair back, lick your lips, and maintain your sultry expression. look up at the ceiling as you caress your breasts, and show what a great time you re having.    lightly kick off your heels while placing one foot on the chair, showing off your gorgeous legs. make sure to keep your heels nearby    you ll need them again soon. stroke your leg with your hands. then, slowly roll down the stocking and toss it to your partner or to the crowd.   repeat this step with your other leg, until your legs are bare and all you re wearing is your bra and underwear.    gently lower your feet back into the shoes, one at a time. you can hold on to the chair if you need help, as long as you continue to look sexy. the striptease will be sexier if you stick to the heels.    unclasp the bra until it s just covering your breasts, and hold it there. turn around to show off your bare back, and lower the bra and toss it to the side. first, cover your breasts with your hands, gyrate, and continue to caress them. then, slowly move your hands off your breasts, and turn around so you don t show too much at once.   turn back to face the person, and let them see your sexy body.    turn around and pull down your underwear, taking care to leave your shoes on. when you turn to the front, first, cover yourself with your hands, and then move them away from your private parts to caress the rest of your body. let everyone see how sexy you are, when you move around wearing only high heels.    lick your lips and kick your heels across the room until you re completely nude. and then, prepare for whatever s next    lots of tips from the crowd, or a sexy session with your partner.

query	29	 if you current dvd does not have certain subtitles, found under the  settings  or  language  headers on the dvd menu, you will not be able to add them without advanced software and equipment. dvd s are protected and cannot be re written, and your dvd player will not be able to add new languages. your computer, however, is a different beast entirely, and you can add any new subtitles you can find to a movie watched on your computer.   if you re watching on a dvd players, try the  titles  or  subtitle  button on your dvd player s remote.    find the folder or movie file in finder or windows explorer. more likely than not it will be a .mov, .avi, or .mp4 file. luckily, you do not need to adjust the movie file at all, however, you will need to find it and link it to a new subtitle file. subtitle files will usually end in the extension .srt, and are simply the words and the times that each title needs to play during the movie.   you need the movie in it s own file, with the .srt file, for it to read the subtitles. some older subtitle files might end in the extension .sub.  go on your favorite search engine and search for the subtitles in your language. if, for example, you want indonesian subtitles for x men  first class, you might search for  x men  first class indonesian subtitles.  the first site you find is likely good enough, as these files are small and not likely to contain viruses.  download an srt. file from a website such as subscene, moviesubtitles, or yifisubtitles. make sure you avoid any pop ups and only download .srt or .sub files. if you feel unsafe on a site, leave and find another.    if the movie is bestmovieever.avi, your subtitle needs to be written as bestmovieever.srt. find you newly downloaded file wherever you put it  often in the  downloads  folder  and make sure you rename appropriately. the .srt file name must be the same name as the movie.  make a new, dedicated folder for you movie if there isn t one already. place the .srt file in the same folder as your movie. this will automatically link them in most video players.   the easiest video player to use is the free vlc player, which handles most file formats.    after clicking captions, click on  add a caption track  and find your .srt file. make sure that you have  caption track  enabled and not  transcript track.  click the  cc  button when watching your video to enable captions.    subtitles are translations, and as anyone who has ever used google translate can tell you, translations are as much an art form as a science. if you re subtitling the scene itself, there are several considerations you need to come up with for each line    what is the goal of the dialog  regardless of the words they use, what feeling is the character trying to get across  this is your guiding principle when translating. how can you fit the subtitled words within the time the character is speaking  some writers will display a few lines of dialogue at once, starting a little early and ending late to give viewers a chance to read everything. how do you handle slang and figures of speech  they often do not translate well, so you ll have to substitute slang or figurative language from your native language. this, however, requires you to look up the meaning of foreign expressions and slang.  sites like dotsub, amara, and universal subtitler let you see the movie while you write out the subtitles, eventually spitting out an .srt file that fits with your movie. while all subtitling sites work differently, they all follow a similar format    choose when the title starts. write the title out. choose when the title disappears. repeat across the movie, marking  complete  when finished. download the .srt file and place it in the same folder as your movie.  you can write out subtitles by hand if you want though the process is greatly expedited by a program. to do so, open up a text editor like window s notepad or apple s textedit  both free and pre installed , and make sure you know the proper format for a subtitle. before beginning, click  save as  and title it after  yourmovie.srt.  then set the encoding to  ansi  for english subtitles and  utf 8  for non english.then write out your titles. each of the following parts goes on its own line, so hit  enter  after each one     the number of a subtitle. 1 would be the first title, 2 the second, etc.  the duration of the subtitle. this is written in the format hours minutes seconds milliseconds     hours minutes seconds milliseconds  example  00 01 20 003     00 01 27 592     the text of the subtitle  this is simply what the title will say.  a blank line. leave one blank line before the number of the next title.  this method lets you see the titles as you add them and adjust their placement, color, and style by hand. open your movie file in your favorite film editor, such as premier, imovie, or windows movie maker, and pull the film into your timeline  the work section . from here, click on your programs  titles  menu and choose a style you like. write out your title, drag it on top of the appropriate section of the film, and repeat.   you can right click on a title and copy and paste it to keep your same settings on every title, saving you tons of time. the only drawback to this format is that the movie will need to be saved as a separate file. you will not be able to turn the titles off, as they will now be part of the movie.

query	31	 make sure the colour isn t too dark or bright. it should be a lime sort of green.   nan  remember not to wear any clothes with the same green colour as your green screen.    saving the video to your computer is a good idea, in case you accidentally delete it on your camera.     if you are using windows vista or later, be sure to open notepad as an administrator.     go into the transition section, and there should be a transition called greenscreen.    this merges the two clips together.    there may be some blotchy bits if the green background isn t good enough, and there may be some parts on yourself that are see through because you are wearing a similar colour to the background.    you can also use a blue screen, but the code you wrote into notepad is not capable of detecting blue. for your information, the real name for green screen is chroma key.   there are advanced editing programs such as final cut pro that have built in codes and can replace any background colour at all.  
query	32	 old houses  like 100 or 200 years old, not from the 1970s, 1980s, or 1990s  are good places to look for ghosts.   sometimes when a person dies, their spirit will return to the place where they died or a place they can t bear to leave behind, which is often their family home. these spirits are not usually malevolent  unless their death was violent , so household ghosts are a good place to start for the rookie ghost hunter. just be sure to get permission before you go ghost hunting on private property.    cemeteries are another good location for ghost catching, even if they can be a little creepy at night    sometimes, ghosts cannot bear to leave their physical bodies behind after death, while other spirits  particular those who haven t been able to move on  come to visit the graves of their family and friends.    some of the best locations for ghosts are places where large numbers of tragic deaths occurred, such as old schools, prisons, and asylums.   not all schools are haunted, but you may have an old school building in your area where students or teachers died due to tragic accidents like fires or smoke inhalation  this was more common in the days when classrooms were heated by iron stoves .    old prison buildings are places where many prisoners may have died due to old age, illness, murder or the death sentence.   even if prisoners didn t die there, prison may have been a place of intense loneliness, fear and anger for some people, causing their spirits to return there after death.    insane asylums were notorious for their mistreatment of patients, using inhumane treatments such as shock therapy, water submersion and lobotomies and causing much unnecessary pain and suffering for the unfortunate victims. this makes the sites of old insane asylums a prime location for ghosts.   be warned, however    these spirits may be angry and violent, seeking retribution for their poor treatment in life.    sites where a large number of deaths occurred are a popular location for ghosts, especially if those deaths were violent. this makes the locations of former battles  even if they have since been built over  prime ghost hunting territory.    as mentioned already, people who died tragic or violent deaths are more likely to return to our world as spirits.   therefore, if you are familiar with the location of a murder or a tragic accident  such as a car crash, drowning or fatal fall , this could be a good spot to test your ghost hunting prowess.    the most haunted locations in a specific area will depend on the history of each place and the number of paranormal experiences local people have reported.   therefore, it s a good idea to listen to talk to people and do some research in the local library to find out where to look. many cities and towns will have their very own haunted bridge, road or tunnel where decades worth of unusual activity has been reported.  a manual camera is preferable to a digital one as you will have greater control over the exposure, making you more likely to catch a snap of the ghost. the ghost may appear as a blur or streak of light in the developed photograph.   in addition, paranormal activity tends to interfere with the operation of electrical equipment, making a digital camera unreliable.    a camcorder can also be used to catch a glimpse of any unusual shapes or activity at your chosen ghost catching location.   make sure to start recording at the beginning of the session and leave the camcorder running until the end. it will be easier if you set the camcorder on a tripod for the duration of the session. if your camera has a night vision feature make sure to turn it on, as this will make spotting a ghost that much easier.    sometimes a tape recorder will pick up on sounds that you wouldn t normally be able to hear. these sounds will only reveal themselves when you play the tape back.   keep in mind that you may have to slow down or speed up the playback or use headphones in order to make sense of what you re hearing.    an emf  electromagnetic field  detector measures changes or disruptions to surrounding electrical fields, which may indicate the presence of a ghost.   good emf detectors can pick up on disturbances across a wide range of frequencies. emf detectors can be purchased online, for anywhere between  20 and several hundred dollars.    other specialist equipment that may benefit the serious ghost hunter includes    an infrared thermal scanner, which is used to detect hot or cold spots caused by energy sucking ghosts. an air ion counter, which measures the number of positive and negative ions in the air. ghosts are believed to emit a high quantity of positive ions. however, these items are expensive and will require a certain amount of specialist knowledge in order to interpret the results.    in recent years, many ghost hunting phone apps have become available, which claim to do the work of expensive, specialist ghost hunting equipment.   the more advanced apps include emf detectors, audio detectors and evp  electronic voice phenomena  instruments and other ghost detecting capabilities. the reliability of these apps is the subject of heated debate, and many people consider them just scams or jokes. however, if you re not willing to invest in more expensive equipment, you might want to try them out.  aside from relying on electrical equipment, you ll need to be alert to any physical indications that a ghost may be present.   watch out for items falling or moving location, seemingly of their own accord. keep an ear out for unusual and unexplained noises, such as bangs or thumps. pay attention to any sudden changes in temperature, or for general feelings of unease or feeling  spooked .    if you want to lay a troubled spirit to rest, you should use this method.   take a metal container with a tight fitting lid and cover the bottom with a layer of soil taken from hallowed ground, such as a church or cemetery. leave the container open at the location where you found the ghost. the sanctified soil will draw the spirit in. once you have used your ghost detection apparatus to confirm that the spirit has entered the container, slowly and gently replace the lid, then sprinkle a pinch of salt on top. bury the container in hallowed ground.    the candle method is good for trapping pesky spirits who are causing trouble around the home.   take a large glass jar, open the lid and place a candle inside. at midnight, light the candle and place the jar in a central point at the haunted location. the ghost will be attracted by the energy emitted by the burning candle, but this energy will also trap the ghost inside the jar. once you have confirmed the ghost s presence inside the jar, tightly

query	36	 often, notecards  also known as index cards  are used to make source cards, as they are neat and easy to reference, but you can also create a list in a notebook or on your computer.make sure to keep all the information in the same place, as this will make it easier for you to write your reference list later, once you ve finished writing your paper. this article will focus on how to write your source cards on notecards, but the same technique can be applied to writing source cards in a notebook or on your computer.    the author s name will be on the outside cover of the book, as well as on the inside title page. as you will eventually alphabetize the source cards by the authors  last names, put the author s last name in the upper left hand corner of the notecard, on the first line. place a comma after the name, then list the author s first name and middle name or initial  if provided . for example, if the author s name is  bobby dee brown,  it will look like this    brown, bobby dee.          underneath the author s name, you will include the title of the book, along with the subtitle  if it has one . the title and subtitle will be listed on the cover and the title page. if the book does have a subtitle, use a colon to separate the main title from the subtitle.in the example below,  cats like to jump  is the main title and  cats and their peculiarities  is the subtitle    brown, bobby dee. cats like to jump  cats and their peculiarities when writing out source cards by hand, the title of the book should always be underlined, so it is easy to identify. if you are typing out your source cards on a computer, however, the title of the book should be placed in italics instead.    all of this information is generally on the back of the title page, though sometimes it can be found on the front side, as well. this information should be written on the line beneath the book title. put the city of publication first, followed by a colon, and then the publisher. after the publisher, add a comma and then the date. in the example below,  kansas city  is the city of publication, while  brown prairie publishing  is the publishing company and  2011  is the date    brown, bobby dee. cats like to jump  cats and their peculiarities kansas city  brown prairie publishing, 2011.    with so much information online these days, some citation styles require you to list where you found the information, so it s important to know where the source came from. even if you just found the book at the library, you should include that information on the source card, in case you need to find the book again. it should look something like this    brown, bobby dee. cats like to jump  cats and their peculiarities kansas city  brown prairie publishing, 2011. kansas state university library.    if you like, you can also include a number in the upper right hand corner of the card, starting with  1  on your first source.  then when you are writing out notes for your paper, you can just include the reference number for each source card beside the relevant information in your notes. this will significantly speed up the referencing process when it comes to actually writing your paper.       however, it s still safer to include the author s name and the date of publication  or a shortened form of the title  next to the information when taking notes. this way, if you lose your source cards for whatever reason, you can still easily identify the source for the notes you took.          like with a book, place the author s name on the first line in the upper left hand corner of the card, with the last name first. let s say our author s name is jo ross. it will look like this    ross, jo.    the title should be at the top of the article. the title of

article was published in february of 2002, so write the month and year, followed by a colon    ross, jo.  analysis of the behavior of grey cats   the sociology of cats feb. 2002     one piece of information you need to include with a journal article that you don t need with a book is the volume and issue numbers. these should be located in the bibliographic information online, or at the front of the journal or in the header or footer in print. in this example, the volume number is 14 and the issue number is 2. occasionally, journal articles won t have these numbers.   ross, jo.  analysis

ebscohost on the sociology database    ross, jo.  analysis of the behavior of grey cats   the sociology of cats feb. 2002  14 2  22 44 ebscohost sociology    sometimes the author of a website can be difficult to find. however, on good websites, the author should be under the title, at the bottom of the page, or on the  about us  page. write the name of the author on the upper left hand corner of the notecard. in this example, the author s name is greg haws, so the name is written as follows    haws, greg.    establish the title of the particular page you sources your information from, which may be different from the main website. in this example, the specific page being referenced is  cows like to moo . write this information beneath the author s name, and be sure to put quotation marks

and underline it.   haws, greg.  cows like to moo  the story of cows    next, add the year of publication below the title of the website. the year should be at the top of the webpage, under the title or at the bottom of the webpage. if the article also has a month and date, include those too. in this example, the year is 2001.   haws, greg.  cows like to moo  the story of cows 2001.    in addition to the above mentioned information, you ll need to add the date on which you accessed the site. this information is important, as websites can change or disappear over time. in this example, the website was accessed on the 18th of june, 2014.   haws, greg.  cows like to moo  the story of cows 2001. june 18, 2014.    finally, you ll need to include the exact url of the website, so your readers can access the information themselves, if they wish. in this example, the fictitious example used is www.thestoryofcows.com cowsmoo.   haws, greg.  cows like to moo  the story of cows 2001. june 18, 2014. www.thestoryofcows.com cowsmoo    once you ve written your cards, you can organize them one of two ways. the easiest way is to alphabetize them by the authors  last names, as that is how you will be organizing your reference page. just put them in order in a box  or use a rubber band to keep them together , adding sticky notes where you change letters.    the second way to organize is by the numbers in the right hand corner, if you re using that system. you can add sticky notes every tenth number to make it easier to look up information.

query	40	 the repair and deduct remedy allows you to deduct money from the rent, up to a certain limit, in order to make repairs in the rental unit. you can only use this remedy when there has been a substantial violation of the implied warranty of habitability. examples of substantial violations might include a leak in the roof during rainy season, no heat during the winter, or no hot running water.   this remedy has certain legal technicalities that can make it difficult to put into action. therefore, if possible, you should speak with a landlord tenant lawyer or another professional to make sure you are proceeding correctly.in addition, some states, for example indiana, do not allow this remedy.make sure your state allows this remedy before you proceed.    before using the repair and deduct remedy, you must make sure the defects to your rental unit were caused by the landlord and not by you, your family, guests, or pets.remember, while the landlord must maintain your unit in a livable condition, you must work with them and hold up your end of the agreement. if the defect was caused by something you should or should not have done, you will not be able to use this remedy. however, if the defects were caused by your landlord, this remedy may be a good option for you.   for example, if, when you moved in to your unit, the bathroom did not include a shower or toilet, the defects were clearly caused by your landlord in breach of the implied warranty of habitability. however, if the defect was caused when you tried to use your bedroom as a kitchen, you may not be able to take legal action against your landlord.    in order to properly use the repair and deduct remedy, the defects in your unit must be serious enough to affect your health and safety.different states will analyze this requirement differently, so make sure you get help if you need it. if you have a major defect, you will usually be able to use this remedy. however, if the defect is only minor, you may not be able to repair and deduct.   examples of major defects include a broken hot water heater, a front door that will not lock, a toilet that will not flush, a broken heater during the winter, or a unit filled with deteriorating lead paint. examples of minor defects include a leak that causes a small stain in the ceiling, a furnace that makes noise when it runs, a screen door with a broken latch, a lobby that needs to be vacuumed, a broken heater during the summer, or an apartment with faded paint.  if you are going to repair the defect yourself and deduct the cost from your rent, the repairs cannot cost more than one month s rent.therefore, calculate how much it will cost to make the repairs before you get them done. if the repairs will cost more than one month s rent, do not use this remedy.   for example, assume you pay  1,400 in rent each month and your hot water heater is completely broken. when you call a repair person, they give you a  1,500 estimate to fix it. in this instance, you should not use the repair and deduct remedy because you will only be able to deduct  1,400 for the repairs. you will end up paying  100 out of pocket.    before you make the repairs yourself and deduct the costs from your rent payment, you must notify your landlord of your intentions to use the repair and deduct remedy and give them an opportunity to fix the problem. whenever you give notice to your landlord, it should be in writing. the letter should contain a detailed description of the defect and the repairs that are required. make sure you sign and date the letter and keep a copy for your own records.   send the completed letter to your landlord through the mail or deliver a copy to them in person. when you deliver the notice to your landlord, request a signed receipt as proof they received it.  once your landlord has been notified of the serious defect, they must have some time to fix the problem. the amount of time you need to give your landlord will depend on the seriousness of the problem. in most states, 30 days is considered a reasonable amount of time. however, if the defect is serious  e.g., a broken heater in the middle of winter , a couple of days may be considered reasonable.  if the landlord fails to make the required repairs within a reasonable time, you may make the repairs yourself or hire someone to make them for you. once the repairs are completed and it is time to pay rent, you can deduct the cost of the repairs from your rent payment. keep all the receipts as evidence of the repair costs. it is also a good idea to include a letter with your rent check that explains why money has been deducted from your normal rent payment.for example, assume you have a serious defect in your rental unit that was caused by your landlord. you gave your landlord notice of the defects and a reasonable time to fix them. your monthly rent is  600 per month and the repairs will cost  250. when your landlord fails to fix the defects in a timely manner, you hire someone to fix them and pay them  250 for their work. when rent is due, you will be able to deduct  250 from your normal monthly payment. therefore, you will only pay  350 that month instead of your normal  600.    you should not use the repair and deduct remedy if you are unsure about whether you meet any of the requirements. for example, the defects may not be serious enough to allow you to use this remedy or you may have inadvertently caused the defect yourself. in these circumstances, if you use the repair and deduct remedy, your landlord may sue you to recover the money deducted from your rent. in addition, your landlord may file an action to evict you based on nonpayment of rent.   also, be aware that you can only use this remedy twice in any 12 month period.  if the defects in your rental unit cost more than one month s rent, or if you simply cannot handle the time and hassle of making repairs  especially if you are having to do this often , you might choose to abandon the rental unit instead of repairing and deducting. when you abandon the rental unit, you move out. in order to use the abandonment remedy, the defects in you unit must be so serious that they substantially affect your health and safety  i.e., the landlord violated the implied warranty of habitability .   similarly to the repair and deduct remedy, you must be able to distinguish between major and minor defects. if your defect is major, you will most likely be allowed to use this remedy. however, if the defect is only minor, you may not be able to abandon the property.  before moving out, you need to keep a detailed record of the defects giving rise to the lease violation. this is important because you will have to give notice to your landlord and because you need to make sure the defects were not caused by you. remember, if the defects were caused by you, your family, your guests, or your pets, you will not be able to take action for lease violations.   when you keep a record of the defects, take pictures, write down notes, and keep track of other important information so you have it when you inform your landlord. you might even have an inspection of the property done to evidence the seriousness of the defects.  before you abandon the rental property, you must notify your landlord of the defects and give them an opportunity to fix the problems. when you give notice to your landlord, do it in writing. the letter needs to contain a description of the defects and the repairs that are required. when you are finished writing the letter, sign and date it. keep a copy of the letter for your own records.   send the completed notice to your landlord or deliver a copy to them in person. when you deliver the notice, make sure your landlord gives you a signed receipt as proof that they received it.allow your landlord an opportunity to fix the defects. before you can move out, you must give your landlord a reasonable opportunity to fix the defects. if the defects are fixed in a reasonable amount of time, you will not be able to abandon the property. in most states, 30 days is considered a reasonable amount of time. however, serious defects may require the landlord to act quicker. for example, if tree roots are blocking the main sewer line and your toilets do not work, a reasonable amount of time may be one or two days.  if your landlord does not fix the defects in a reasonable amount of time, you should notify them that you plan on moving out and abandoning the property. the letter should include all of your reasons for moving out along with evidence that your reasons are legitimate. your notice should include a description of when you will move out and that you will return all keys to the landlord.   within your notice you should also provide all of the evidence of the defects that you have collected. this might include pictures, inspection reports, and handwritten notes. your notice might also discourage your landlord from suing you by stating the legal standard you are using to abandon the property.  once you provide notice to your landlord you will move out of the rental unit. make sure you return all of the landlord s property to the landlord  i.e., keys to the unit .do not leave any of your property in the unit and do not do anything to make the unit more defective than it already is. if you fail to move out properly  i.e., if you cause major defects or leave your property behind  your landlord might be able to bring an action against you to recoup some costs.    if the defects do not rise to the level required to use this remedy, the landlord might sue you to collect rent and or damages. these damages can be substantial considering you are breaking your lease and moving out of your unit completely. great care should be taken to ensure you are using this remedy properly.  the remedy of withholding rent from your landlord can only be used in very serious situations. when you withhold rent you are choosing not to pay your landlord some or all of the required payments. in order to use this remedy properly, the defects to your unit must be more serious than defects justifying the use of repair and deduct or abandonment remedies. therefore, the defects must be so serious that they immediately threaten your health and safety.   for example, in california, a court allowed a tenant to use the withholding remedy when the defects were so serious that the unit was unequivocally uninhabitable. in that particular case, the tenant had all of the following defects at the same time  a collapse of the bathroom s ceiling, a continued presence of rats and cockroaches, a lack of any heat, plumbing blockages, exposed and faulty wiring, and an illegally installed stove.  if your defects rise to a similar level to those seen in the california court case and they were not caused by you, you need to notify your landlord of the defects and give them a reasonable time to make the repairs. your notification should be in writing and should detail all of the defects present in your rental unit. include photographs, videos, witness statements, and inspection reports if possible. when your letter is complete, sign and date it and give it to your landlord. make sure you get a signed receipt as evidence that your landlord saw your notice.   once your landlord is notified of the defects, he or she will have a reasonable amount of time to make repairs. in a rent withholding situation, the defects are likely going to be so serious that a reasonable amount of time may only be one or two days.  if your landlord does not repair the defects in a reasonable amount of time, you can withhold some or all of the rent. you can continue to withhold rent until all the repairs are made. to determine how much rent to withhold, courts will usually use one of the following tests the percentage reduction in rent. to use this method, you need to determine the percentage of your unit that is uninhabitable due to the defects. the rent will then be reduced by that amount. for example, if one of your four rooms is uninhabitable, you will be able to reduce the amount of rent you owe by 25 . therefore, if your normal rent is  1,000 per month, you will only pay  750 per month until the necessary repairs are made. the reasonable value of rental unit. to use this method, you will determine the value of the rental unit in its defective state. you will then pay your landlord the difference between the normal rent value in your lease and the defective rental value. for example, assume you determine that the value of your unit is  200 per month in its defective state. you can further assume your normal rent payment is  600 per month. in this example, you would withhold  200 every month and pay  400 in rent until the defects are repaired.    when you withhold rent, do not spend the withheld money. the money you withhold should be placed in an escrow account and you should notify the landlord that you are doing so. an escrow account is a special type of bank account used to hold money that may or may not belong to someone else. you should do this for the following reasons first, rent withholding cases often end up in court. if the judge disagrees with your calculations, you may have to pay your landlord a portion of the money you originally withheld. if a judge rules against you, you will have to make the required payment within five days of the judge s ruling. second, placing the money in an escrow account provides evidence that you are not withholding rent to simply avoid payments. third, a lot of legal organizations will not represent you unless you have placed your withheld rent in an escrow account.    as with the other lease violation remedies, there are inherent risks in using the withholding method. if the defects are not serious enough to allow for this remedy, the landlord can sue you for rent and may even be able to evict you. even if you win a court case about withholding rent, the court may not agree with the amount you withheld and may require you to pay some of the withheld money to the landlord.  all of the other methods in this article allow you to take action against lease violations without bringing a lawsuit. as a last resort, if no other remedy gives you the desired outcome, you can file a lawsuit against your landlord to collect damages if defects are not repaired. you can file a lawsuit without ever trying any of the other remedies available to you. to win a lawsuit against your landlord, you must generally be able to show all of the following the rental unit has a serious defect affecting habitability a housing inspector has inspected the unit and deemed it to be uninhabitable the defects continue for 35 days after the housing inspection is completed and the landlord is made aware you did not cause the defects the landlord still tries to collect rent from you    before you file your lawsuit, you should notify your landlord of your intentions. your notice should describe, in detail, the defects that need to be repaired. you should notify your landlord that you will give him or her a reasonable amount of time to make the repairs before you bring the lawsuit. if your landlord fails to make the repairs in a timely manner, you should contact your local housing department to schedule an inspection.   during the 35 day waiting period, you need to collect evidence of the defects. evidence can include pictures, videos, witness testimony, and inspection reports. all of these documents will be used in court to help you prove your case. before you file your lawsuit, talk with a landlord tenant lawyer about your case.if you do not know a good lawyer in your area, contact your state bar association s lawyer referral service. after answering a few general questions, you will be put in contact with multiple qualified lawyers.    in order to file a lawsuit, you will need to prepare a formal complaint. a complaint will contain a caption, which includes the court s name, the parties  names, and a title  i.e., complaint . the first section of your complaint will introduce the parties and the factual situation that has led you to file the suit. there should be a statement of all the important facts as well as the legal standard you are suing under.   your complaint will also need to tell the court why it has jurisdiction over the case. in this scenario, it will usually be enough to say the rental unit is located in the county where you are bringing your suit and the defendant resides in that county as well. the last part of your complaint will ask the court to provide a certain remedy  e.g., an award of money damages .  once your complaint has been written, you will need to file it with the court in the county where the rental property is located and or where the defendant resides. to file your complaint, take it to the courthouse and hand it to the clerk of courts.he or she will stamp your complaint as filed as soon as you pay the filing fee, which is usually around  200  300.    once you file your complaint, you will have to serve a copy on your landlord, who is now the defendant in your case. to serve the defendant, have someone over the age of 18 who is unrelated to the case deliver or mail a copy of your complaint and summons to the defendant. a summons is a form the court will give you when you file your case. once the defendant has been served he or she will have an opportunity to respond to your case by filing an answer.   an answer responds to all of your allegations by admitting or denying each statement you made. the defendant s answer may also contain counterclaims if he or she is choosing to bring an action against you.  once the defendant s answer has been filed you will usually attend a case management conference with the court to determine a schedule of events. discovery will start as soon as this conference ends. you will participate in formal discovery by using discovery tools to ask the other party for information. once discovery ends, the defendant may choose to file a motion for summary judgment. this motion asks the court to end the litigation by claiming there is no way you can win based on the evidence uncovered so far. you will have to defeat a motion for summary judgment by showing the court there are genuine issues of material facts and that the defendant is not entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.   if you succeed in your defense of the motion for summary judgment, you might consider settling your case before trial begins. trials are often time consuming and expensive. a lot of defendants will be willing to settle to avoid trial. you can usually resolve disputes without litigation by taking part in informal settlement discussions, mediation, or arbitration.  if settlement offers fail, you will have to go to trial. trial will start with you picking a jury. as soon as the jury is empaneled, you will make an opening statement. your opening statement will provide a road map of your case and what you intend to prove. the defendant will have an opportunity to make an opening statement after you.   the case will really begin when you present your case to the court. you will do this by offering evidence of the landlord s lease violations through witness testimony and exhibits. once you present your case, the defendant will have an opportunity to present his or her case. after the defendant presents his or her case, both parties will have an opportunity to make closing arguments. during closing arguments, you will recap the important pieces of evidence and highlight why you should win. once the trial is over, the jury will deliberate and return a verdict. if you chose not to have a jury, the judge will consider the evidence and make a decision. once a judgment is entered, you will have to comply with the order. if you win, you will be awarded damages. if you lose, you might be able to appeal to a higher court.  most residential leases are signed, written documents laying out the obligations of you and the landlord. even if your lease is an oral agreement, state laws will dictate how each party must act. while most landlord tenant relationships go smoothly, problems will sometimes arise. if you are a tenant and you feel like your landlord has done something to make your rental unit unlivable, look through the lease agreement for a remedy.in particular, look for provisions about habitability, repairs, and breaches  i.e., violations . these provisions will be important in helping you determine whether a lease violation has occurred and how to remedy it.    research your state s landlord tenant law or ask a professional about your state s implied warranty of habitability. in most states, before a unit can be rented, and while you are renting it, your rental unit must be fit to live in  i.e., habitable . this obligation is assumed to apply to all residential leases, which means your landlord must abide by the law even if there is no habitability provision in your lease.there is only one state that does not have an implied warranty of habitability. in arkansas, when you rent a residence you take it  as is , which means the landlord has no obligation to maintain the premises.  while most statutes require a unit to be fit for human occupation, they do not state how that is to be done. instead, court cases over time have determined what makes a residential unit habitable or uninhabitable. if your unit meets the definition of uninhabitable, the landlord has violated your lease and you can take certain actions to remedy those violations.   when a state defines habitability, they may define it by what is unacceptable  i.e., by what makes a unit unlivable . if your dwelling lacks any of the following, it might be considered uninhabitable  effective weather protection, plumbing facilities in working order, heating facilities in working order, lighting, sanitary grounds, adequate trash receptacles, and working floors, railings, and stairs. other states might define habitability by what must be present in your residential unit. in general, your residential unit must have the following to be considered habitable  a working toilet and shower, a kitchen with a sink, natural lighting in every room, safe emergency exits, operable locks on all doors and windows, working smoke detectors, and a locking mailbox.  while almost every state has an implied warranty of habitability, it is not without limits. as a tenant, you must fulfill certain legal obligations to make sure your unit remains livable. most states will require you to take reasonable care of your unit and to take certain specific actions. if you fail to hold up your end of the agreement, and your failure caused your unit to become unlivable, your landlord will not be required to make repairs. in general, you must do all of the following to make sure the implied warranty of habitability continues to work in your favor keep the unit clean use gas, electricity, and plumbing fixtures properly dispose of trash not destroy or deface your unit not remove any part of your structure use the premises properly  i.e., use the bedroom as a bedroom and not as a kitchen  notify the landlord as soon as possible when things do not work properly

query	49	 you or your lawyer should have received a copy of the indictment or other charging instrument. read it to understand what you have been charged with. the indictment should list the different criminal counts.   if you are charged with only one crime, then you don t have a multiplicity issue. multiplicity exists where you could be given multiple sentences for the same offense.if there are multiple charges, then write them each out on a piece of paper.    there is no easy way to uncover whether two counts are multiplicitous. however, one thing you can check is whether each offense requires proof of a fact that the other does not. if so, then the two counts are not multiplicitous.for example, you might have been charged with battery for punching a bar owner in the face. if you were also charged with battery for kicking the same bar owner in the stomach, then the indictment suffers from multiplicity. an attack on one person is usually only a single assault.however, if you punched the bar owner and then tried to trap him in a closet, then you could properly be charged with battery and false imprisonment. the false imprisonment charge requires proof of an element  confinement  which the battery charge does not.    there is no easy way to decide whether multiple counts qualify as  multiplicity.  for this reason, you should talk to an experienced attorney to

query	50	 at direct donation events, participants and supporters will be able to donate money directly to your pta. direct donation events are a traditional and very popular way to fundraise for the pta.   sell products in which a large portion of the proceeds go toward the pta. for instance, organize a cookie or candy selling event for your pta. provide entertainment or other value added services and request donations from participants. for example, organize a pta car wash, dog wash, or a play. other examples of direct donation events include student art shows, bake sales, or marathons.    a fundraising campaign is an on going process in which you and others associated with the pta raise funds over a certain time. the benefit of a campaign is that you ll have time to develop and spread the word about your campaign   which may ultimately increase the amount of funds you raise.   name a specific goal that that your campaign intends to meet. for example, your campaign may intend to raise money to fund a trip to washington d.c. for the 7th grade class at the end of the academic year. schedule a series of events over the course of several weeks or months. such events could be speakers, dances like father daughter or mother son dances, or other similar events. raise money for your campaign by mailing fliers with donation forms. ask recipients to donate and to solicit donations from friends and family. consider an on going sales event where students and parents sell goods like candy, t shirts, or even yeti products. make sure the event has a definitive time, like a month. make sure to publicize the results of your sales event and to encourage participants to meet the goals of the event. incorporate direct donation events, mail based donation solicitation, on going sales events, and internet fundraising into your campaign.  local businesses are a great, often untapped, source of fundraising dollars in your local community. businesses may see sponsoring an event as an opportunity to bolster their own business.   identify several businesses that might stand to profit from an association with the pta. think about restaurants, sporting goods stores, book stores, or other business that cater to families and children. visit the business and make your pitch. say something like  mr. parker, i was hoping you   and your sporting goods store   would be interested in sponsoring the pta s marathon next month. all you d have to do is help us with a few supplies and you could post advertisements around the event. i think you d get a lot of goodwill from the community.  try to maintain a long term arrangement. after an initial sponsorship deal, let the business or business owner know that you d like to maintain the arrangement in the future. for example, say  mr. brownson, i think your sponsorship was an extreme success. would you be interested in sponsoring our event annually    websites help you create the opportunity to reach a broader audience than you would otherwise reach in your community. through a website, you ll be able to offer a wide variety of products.   have the pta purchase items, like food, t shirts, or other goods, to sell on websites like amazon, craigslist, or even your pta s own website. hold an online auction. have students or parents donate items or services to be auctioned off. then advertise the auction event. use websites like ebay for the actual auction.  online fundraising campaigns are some of the most effective and least time consuming ways to raise money for your pta. by creating an online campaign, you ll be able to get the word out about your pta and raise money over the course of the entire year.   sign up with websites like the cause network. the cause network will help you organize a campaign and contact supporters. sign up with amazon cause and have friends of the pta in your community access amazon through a link tied to your pta. this way, your pta will get a portion of all purchases friends of your pta make on amazon.  email and social media are one of the most efficient and effective ways to reach friends of the pta in and outside your community. by utilizing these online resources, you ll be able to reach more people in a shorter amount of time than direct donation drives in your community.   reach out to the relatives of parents and students who do not live in your community. social media is a great way to recruit grandparents as givers to a specific campaign or event. establish facebook and twitter accounts for your pta. have students and parents friend or follow these accounts. use them to advertise fundraising drives and meetings. for example, you can tweet  lydia maria childs elementary school s pta is having a bake sale this friday to benefit the victims of hurricane taney in south carolina.  send donation requests to friends of the pta in your community. for example, email friends of your pta with a request for funds to sponsor the 5th grade s soup kitchen day charity event on thanksgiving. use email to advertise online campaigns, sales on websites like amazon, or events in your own community.  communication is perhaps the most important part of successfully fundraising for a pta. without communication, people won t be able to effectively organize and plan.   hold regular pta meetings. these meetings should be monthly or biweekly. in addition, hold meetings of key committees. committee meetings may meet monthly or more often depending on what they need to do. create a contact list with email and phone numbers of each member. in addition, create a list of donors and friends of your pta. make sure your pta has a communications secretary   this person oversees sending out emails and making sure people can get in touch with each other.  ultimately, the key to successfully fundraising for a pta is to plan many fundraising activities over the course of the academic year. without scheduling diverse and regular fundraising activities, your pta won t be able to raise sufficient money to meet its goals.   plan many different types of fundraisers. the more diverse your activities, the more people you ll wind up involving. for example while holding a bake sale on a weekday might draw on many stay at home parents, a weekend marathon will help draw parents with different schedules or interests. space your fundraisers out over the course of the year. be conscious of other organizations fundraising drives  like the girl scout s annual cookie sale , and the timing of religious holidays  like christmas or chanukah . for example, try to hold a fundraising event every month of the school year, instead of clumping many together during the busy fall months. fundraising activities should always be associated and advertised as supplying money toward a specific goal or activity. people are more likely to donate if they know where the money is going to.  committees should be tasked with specific roles and have specific responsibilities. in the end, committees are responsible for making sure the mission they oversee is carried out in an organized and systematic manner.   one of the most important part of committees are their leaders. leaders should be elected by members of the pta, committee, or appointed by the executive body of the pta. some committees will be tasked with organizing specific events or campaigns. some committees will have the responsibility of overseeing general responsibilities like strategic planning and marketing.

become like a command center. you need to be able to listen to information and news reports about the storm and the flooding. set up a portable t.v. or radio in a high place that you can easily access.  you will need this space to put supplies on, so make sure your desk is clear of debris and clutter. also, if you have a laptop or computer, it is probably best to unplug and store it away in a plastic bag to avoid damage.    you will want to make sure there is a place for everyone in your family to rest while waiting out the flood. lay down as many sleeping bags as necessary to make sure your family can rest comfortably on the floor of your room.you will also want to bring some extra pillows in there for everyone too.    you will want to bring board games, a deck of cards, or something you can all do together. you will need to pass the time in your shelter and may not have any electricity, so board games and card games are a good way to do that.  now that you have everything set up and your shelter is ready to go, get your family and pets into the shelter you have built. make sure everyone stays calm and listens frequently for updates about the weather.  you ve done an excellent job setting up the shelter for your family. however, floods can change directions and rise quickly. so, during your time in the shelter listen to news and weather reports often and be ready to evacuate your house immediately if you need to.be ready to help elderly family members and pets evacuate with you.    there is really nothing special about flood shelters, other than the fact that they are high off the ground. with this in mind, ask your parents about turning the entire second floor of your house, or your attic space, into a flood shelter. this will give you more room when taking shelter from the storm.   if they say yes, then move all the supplies you gathered around the wider area you are now working with.  
query	54	 amortization refers to spreading the cost of an intangible asset over its useful life. depreciation refers to prorating the cost of a tangible asset over its estimated life.intangible assets include patents, copyrights, and intellectual property. tangible assets include land, buildings, equipment, and vehicles.    these records can usually be found in the company s legal department files. an intangible asset must meet the following criteria    it is a non physical asset that has value to the company. it is an intangible asset that has measurable effect, such as cost  e.g. purchase price, taxes , that can benefit the company. the cost of preparing an intangible asset is attributed to the asset s intended use. for instance, an acquired patent is purchased for its intended use of protecting patent rights for an invention. assets resulting from development are recognized as an intangible asset if the completion of the intangible asset will be used or sold, it can generate future benefits, the expenses attributed to the intangible asset can be measured, and there are available resources to complete the development.  they must have a defined useful life. common types of these intangible assets include the following patents copyrights trademarks intellectual property franchise rights business licenses    this would be due to the asset not having a defined useful life. they generally include the following goodwill  except for private companies  brands mastheads or logos publishing titles customer lists    amortization of intangible assets begins when the asset is acquired or when it is available for use. for example, this would be the date a patent was purchased or applied for, a copyright was issued or a business license was obtained.    as an example, assume that you bought a patent for an invention. it cost you  50,000 to buy the patent so this will be your initial cost.costs cannot be accumulated for making the invention, but can be for applying for a patent.    using the same example, find out the duration of the patent. let s say that your patent for an invention will be protected for 20 years, as stated when it was first granted. this will be the useful life.the useful life of a patent could change over time due to technological advances. if you assumed the patent was useful for 20 years, but after 10 years the value of the technology became useless, you can expense  write off  the remaining value.    use this formula  initial cost   useful life   amortization per year. therefore,  50,000   20    2,500.to calculate the monthly amortization amount, divide the yearly amount by 12.    there will be a line item on the balance sheet for intangible assets. a line under this will say  less amortization.  record the cumulative amortization amount here and subtract it from the intangible assets amount.   the amount that is amortized per year goes on the income statement.    it is important to keep all invoices, patent grants, business licenses, copyrights, trademarks and other intangible assets for at least seven years for future audit purposes. note the dates that all were acquired and the cost for each.    this is especially true when a business is being sold. the importance placed on intellectual property, brand recognition, goodwill and trademarks is becoming even more valuable than tangible assets such as equipment and machinery.

query	62	 there are a seemingly unlimited number of interconnected environmental issues out there for you to tackle. through environmental activism, you can help protect endangered species, clean up pollution, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, encourage conscious usage of resources, help the shift toward renewable energy, restore native landscapes, protect the rainforest, promote sustainable dietary habits, reduce landfill waste, establish recycling programs, or any number of other good deeds. find out what calls to you. in particular, look for environmental issues in your local region and groups you can get involved in.    there are a variety of ways to be a committed environmentalist, each of which caters to different sets of talents. are you a people person  consider becoming a docent and leading nature walks at your local park. or perhaps you re an introverted writer  you might prefer writing letters to congresspeople about your issues of concern from the comfort of your own home. can you play the banjo, bake banana bread, paint faces, or juggle  volunteer at a local earth day fair or environmental fundraiser. just about any skill can be used to contribute to environmental awareness campaigns.    read books and magazines and visit websites about nature s beauty or environmental science. take as many notes as you can. figure out what your favorite animal or plant is. a good place to start is national geographic.    certain people have become leaders in the environmentalist community and serve as figureheads for other environmentalists. write or email people famous for being environmentalists, such as jane goodall or jeff corwin, about any questions you may have. different environmentalists will have different areas of expertise   for instance, jane goodall is an expert on primate society, while jeff corwin is a good choice if you want to know more about a certain animal.    environmentalists have an appreciation for natural beauty. try to foster this appreciation with activities that allow you to experience this beauty first hand. at the park or sanctuary, spot wildlife and take notes on their behavior, size, population, etc. talk to the people who work there about them. keep a notebook of activities.    litter is everywhere. it can be found on roadsides, at big outdoor events, and in busy places, such as gas stations. litter sullies the planet s natural beauty and can even harm and kill wildlife. help keep our home and environment clean by picking litter up and disposing of it properly. left on the ground, litter may eventually end up in the ocean or in an animal s stomach.    environmentalist movements are most successful when they are socially active and community centered. you might, for instance, make an endangered animal club at your school, organize an earth day rally, or teach a workshop on composting. to make the biggest difference you can, get out there and start making allies     warriors for environmental justice must keep their most important weapon   their mind   as sharp as possible to be effective activists. activists may need to debate supporters of industrial capitalism and or sway undecided moderates, both of which will require convincing knowledge and persuasive rhetoric. try to read environmentalist publications and stay abreast of relevant news so that you re knowledgeable and well informed when it counts.   for starters, try to read books such as endgame by derrick jensen to familiarize yourself with why industrial society itself, rather than individual consumer choices, is the root of most environmental problems. once you ve read books like this and wish to proceed to more radical material, you can move on to books that actually lay out a strategy for dismantling key parts of industrial infrastructure  such as refineries, interstates, electrical infrastructure . one great example of this kind of book is deep green resistance  strategy to save the planet. for extreme environmentalists, some select u.s. military strategy manuals, such as counterinsurgency, can help illuminate the methods by which the capitalist system will attempt to defend itself from radical environmentalist movements.    the goal of an activist is not to change modern industrial society on his or her own, but to build wide grassroots support for serious, radical reform. to begin, try sharing your new stance with your friends and family. see what they think about doing whatever it takes to save the planet and gauge whether or not they would be willing to make sacrifices to preserve the planet that gives them the air, water, and food they need to survive. if so, you have found your first supporters.   next, you might try attending local political forums, street fairs, and the like to share your ideas with a larger audience. be prepared for resistance   not everyone will share your love for mother nature.    once you ve managed to recruit supporters and have formed a core group of dedicated activists, identify people and or agencies that are facilitating the greatest amount of ecological destruction on a local level. once these points have been identified, decide amongst your group how best to stop these things from happening   you might try planning protests, gathering signatures for a petition, or a more radical solution.   if you can, directly lobbying politicians may be the most effective way to enact environmental change. the capitalist system encourages politicians to give disproportionate attention to their financial backers at the expense of the larger community and the planet as a whole. leading a targeted lobbying effort aimed at those in power or, better yet, financially backing a politician with sympathetic environmental beliefs, can be a way to confront the forces of industrial capitalism on their own playing field.    if you haven t had immediate success recruiting a group of committed environmentalists to help you with the struggle against the industrial economy, do not fear. it will take time, patience, and hard work to gain enough solid supporters to start to enact change. the struggle against global industry lasts as long as it takes to end the exploitation and pollution carried out against the planet earth every day.   environmentalist literature can be a recruiting tool and a morale booster for already committed environmentalists. hold discussion groups to review the material in books like deep green resistance and endgame. screen resistance oriented films such as end civ or the wind that shakes the barley to grow the spirit of resistance in viewers. pass out educational flyers that show that industrial civilization is the root of environmental destruction. if you have the time, resources, and energy, you might even want to organize a speaking tour to educate people about being a real environmentalist.

query	66	 most insurance companies reward homeowners with discounts ranging from long term customer loyalty rewards to having claim free histories with the company.    insurance companies reward customers who have multiple policies with the company, such as homeowners, automobile and life.    if you can easily afford to pay for a repair in excess of your current deductible, consider raising the deductible to the highest amount you are comfortable paying after an incident. higher deductibles lessen the chance that you will file a claim and most insurance companies reward high deductible policy holders accordingly.    a house with systems newer than 10 years old is considered safer than outdated systems on an older house. wood frame homes on post and pier foundations in earthquake areas will often receive premium discounts once a modern foundation is installed, while homes in hurricane prone regions can lower premiums by adding storm windows and upgraded ul class 4 certified metal roofing.    insurance companies often give discounts to policy holders who have installed modern burglar, smoke and carbon dioxide detectors on the premises.   before investing in additional security protection, learn how much of a discount you will receive after the installation. ask your insurance agent what security improvements are eligible for discounts.    insurance companies will often lower premiums for property owners who create wide swaths of empty space around the property to lessen the risk of damage to the structure if wildfire occurs.    insurance companies rate clients based on their credit history  customers with bad credit history will pay higher insurance premiums. if you have damaged credit, take steps to raise your credit score by paying off bad debt, negotiating settlement amounts with creditors and decreasing your debt to income ratio by staying out of credit card debt.

query	71	 most individual u.s. states regulate acupuncture licensing, but these states typically work with the national certification commission for acupuncture and oriental medicine  nccaom  to determine eligibility for licensure.   nccaom is the only nationally recognized certification granted to acupuncturists, but having the certification does not necessarily mean someone is a licensed acupuncturist. acupuncturists are usually required to pass nccaom exams to be licensed, but in addition to this exam, the specific state the acupuncturist will be practicing in might have additional licensure requirements.currently, 43 u.s. states as well as the district of columbia work with the nccaom to assess and regulate acupuncture licensure.california administers its own exam, the california licensing examination, to grant licensure to acupuncturists.    licensed acupuncturists attend and graduate from nationally accredited colleges of acupuncture. this education is usually at a master s level, takes 3 to 4 years to complete, and is supervised by experienced and qualified acupuncturists. acupuncturists to become licensed, the national certification commission for acupuncture and oriental medicine requires that applicants attend a program accredited by the accreditation commission for acupuncture and oriental medicine  acaom . there are about 60 of these accredited programs in the u.s.to maintain their license, acupuncturists must also complete continuing education courses. even after completing coursework and graduating from a program, most states also require that applicants for licensure pass nccaom certification exams on topics such as acupuncture with point location, chinese herbology, and oriental medicine. state requirements vary as to which nccaom exams or how many different nccaom exams a person must pass before being granted licensure.    in addition to taking courses at an accredited college of acupuncture, acupuncturists must complete extensive hands on training before they are granted licenses to practice.licensed acupuncturists complete at least 1500 to 2000 hours of training as part of their educational program. before being granted licensure, acupuncturists are required to have seen and treated at least 250 actual patients.    when trying to locate a licensed acupuncturist, you might encounter medical professionals who perform acupuncture or claim they are certified in acupuncture. this designation is often used by physicians, chiropractors, physical therapists, and dentists who employ acupuncture techniques in their fields, but this does not necessarily mean they have the level of training and experience as licensed acupuncturists.in comparison to licensed acupuncturists, individuals claiming they are certified in acupuncture usually complete 100 to 300 hours of training. the certification is typically granted by a professional organization in the individual s field such as the american academy of medical acupuncture, the national acupuncture detoxification association, or the international veterinary acupuncture society.certified acupuncturists are not required to pass nccaom exams. certified acupuncturists often do not have as much hands on experience with patients before being granted certification. certified acupuncturists are not required to complete continuing education courses.    regulations on acupuncture licensing vary among states. before you start looking for a licensed acupuncturist, familiarize yourself with the specific requirements in your area.   the nccaom maintains a database of these requirements, which is available through their website.  one of the easiest ways to locate a licensed acupuncturist in your area is to use the search engine or registry provided on the national certification commission for acupuncture   oriental medicine  nccaom  website.keep in mind that the nccaom registry only includes practitioners who elect to make their information available through the registry. this means that it is possible for an acupuncturist to be licensed but not appear in the registry. if someone you know recommended a specific acupuncturist, you can use the nccaom website to verify their licensure or contact the organization by phone or email to confirm they are licensed.    your physician has likely referred patients to a licensed acupuncturists in the past, and should be able to recommend one.even if you receive a recommendation from your physician or another medical professional, it s a good idea to use the other steps in this article to verify the individual is a licensed acupuncturist and make sure their licensing is up to date.    an acupuncturist may be certified through the national certification commission for acupuncture and oriental medicine, but not licensed through the state they are located in. as a result, it s a good idea to contact your state s acupuncture board to verify whether an acupuncturist is licensed to practice in your area.  another helpful way to find a licensed acupuncturist is to research patient ratings and reviews online. these will often provide insight into whether an acupuncturist is licensed, but also provide you with invaluable information about their bedside manner and skills.   contact an organization like the better business bureau, either online or by phone, to see how other patients rate this acupuncturist. while patient reviews can be helpful, don t rely on them exclusively. instead, use them in conjunction with the other methods discussed in the article so you can be confident that someone is a licensed acupuncturist.    to get a more detailed review of a licensed acupuncturist, ask the office for a current or past patient referral.   many offices are prepared for these requests and will try to provide the contact information of a patient with a condition similar to yours that the acupuncturist treated. if the office declines the request because of privacy concerns, don t be alarmed. you want to work with an acupuncturist who is professional and will respect patient privacy.    before you schedule an appointment or procedure with a specific acupuncturist, verify again that the acupuncturist is board certified by the nccaom and that their certification and license are up to date.   your state s acupuncture board or the acupuncturists  office should have no problem confirming this information.    not all insurance providers cover acupuncture treatments and not all acupuncturists accept insurance, so talk with your insurance provider and the acupuncturists  office staff before setting up an appointment. these details might influence which licensed acupuncturist you ultimately decide to work with, so here are a few questions to ask in advance how many treatments will the insurance carrier provide  what will your copay for a visit to a licensed acupuncturist be  does the insurance company require a referral from a physician  what conditions are covered for acupuncture  some insurance companies only cover acupuncture for pain relief. does the insurance provider have specific requirements about who can provide the acupuncture  how will the acupuncturist deal with insurance  for example, they might want to be paid in full up front, and recommend that you file a claim for reimbursement with your insurance provider on your own.    it s important to meet with the acupuncture practitioner you are thinking of working with before proceeding with any treatment. this will provide you with another opportunity to verify that they have appropriate credentials, but also give you a chance to assess whether you feel comfortable working with this individual.   if you don t want to schedule a formal appointment at this stage, contact the office and see if there is a time you might be available to meet with the acupuncturist for a few minutes. if you schedule a more formal initial visit, ask the acupuncturist about the steps involved in treatment, how much relief you might expect it to provide, and how much it would cost.    though all licensed acupuncturists are required to understand general practice, some specialize in certain fields such as fertility or dermatology. if you would like to work with an acupuncturist who specializes in a specific field, take this into consideration when researching licensed acupuncturists.   if the acupuncturist has a website or is featured on one, their online profile might describe his or her areas of interest or specialty. if you re uncertain whether you need a specialist, you can always see a general acupuncturist first and discuss whether your treatment requires a specialist.    like with any medical professional, it can take time to find the right acupuncturist for you and your needs. if you are not comfortable with the practitioner you selected or have concerns that the treatment is not working, you can reconsider your options and get a second opinion from a different licensed acupuncturist or other medical professional.  
query	72	 even though apgar refers to the designer s name, it can also be used as an acronym   apgar  can stand for appearance  skin color , pulse, grimace response  reflexes , activity  muscle tone , and respiration. this test is used to measure the overall well being of the baby by looking at the major indicators of wellness.  the first category is appearance. in this part of the test, the medical staff will look at the baby s skin color. the skin color can indicate whether the baby is receiving enough oxygen or not.a zero in this category means the baby is blue all over. a one means the baby is mostly a healthy color but may be bluish at the hands and feet. a two means the baby is a healthy color all over, including pink at the hands and feet.    the next category on the apgar test is heart rate. a nurse, doctor, or midwife will check for the baby s heartbeat. the medical staff will also determine the pulse rate to see how the baby is thriving.if the baby doesn t have a heart rate, the score is zero. a score of one indicates a heart rate under 100 beats per minute, which is not quite as fast as it should be. a score of two indicates the baby s heart rate is over 100, which means the baby is thriving in this particular category.    the grimace response is how the baby reacts to mild stimulus. for instance, the baby may be lightly pinched to see if the baby responds a lot or if it doesn t respond at all to the stimulus.a zero indicates no response. a one means the baby pulls a face  grimaces  but doesn t sneeze or cough. a two means the baby pulls a face and either cries, pulls away, sneezes, or coughs in response.    next comes a check of muscle tone. muscle tone just measures the baby s activity to see if it is moving around on its own. an active baby indicates that they are doing well.a zero indicates the baby is limp or not moving much at all. if the baby is given a one, it means they are moving with smaller or less active motions, but they are not as vigorous as the doctor would prefer. a two means the baby is actively moving around.    the last category on the apgar test is breathing. a person on the medical staff examines the baby to see how they re breathing, then assigns a number to the breathing effort from zero to two based on what they observe.a zero means the baby is not breathing, while a one means the baby has irregular breathing. a two means is the baby is breathing just fine, which usually means the baby is both breathing and crying with normal effort and at a normal rate.    the score from the apgar is generally taken as a whole rather than in individual categories. in other words, all the scores from each category are added together to get one number. the best possible score is ten, which means the baby is doing as well as they can be. however, most babies don t score a ten at birth.a score from seven to ten means the baby will just need standard care. if the score is under seven, the baby will need more monitoring and possibly interventions, such as help breathing.  while a low score may seem scary, it usually doesn t mean the baby will have long term health effect. rather, it just means the baby needs a little extra care right after birth to help stabilize their health.certain factors can cause the apgar score to be lower. often, it s caused by a c section, premature birth, or a birth that s a bit more difficult than other births. a low score can also be caused by fluid in the airway.    if the baby has a low score, generally one of two things will happen. with the first intervention, the baby s airway will be cleared out if it has fluid, and the baby will be given oxygen. a second option is the baby may be given stimulation to get the heart beating more rapidly.keep in mind that if these basic interventions do not work, the medical team will do whatever is necessary to improve the baby s condition. this can vary based on the causes of the score.    generally, the baby will be placed somewhere warm while the test is performed. that can either be on a parent s belly or under a warmer. keeping the baby warm is important.  as the name implies, the one minute test is performed a minute after the baby leaves the mother s body. it tells the medical staff how well the baby did during the birthing process and accesses the baby s need for assistance.  the five minute test, as it sounds, is given five minutes after birth. this test is the same as the one minute test, but it s given to measure how the baby is doing out in the world  out of the womb .this test also helps evaluate whether any interventions are working.  while the test is usually just performed twice, it may be given a third time if the baby has a low score. usually, it s given at the ten minute mark to see if the baby has improved any from the five minute test.
query	73	 spend some time observing your cat s behavior. without serious observation, you won t fully understand the problem and won t be able to determine a course of action to take. try to commit relatively significant amount of time watching how your cat behaves.  use a notebook to record undesirable behavior. for example, make a note if your cat paws you or another cat. pay special attention to what actions or events may trigger your cat s undesirable behavior. for instance, your cat may exhibit bad behavior when there is a lot of noise or tumult in the room. try to set aside some time every day to watch your cat. you may want to do this when your cat is more likely to behave poorly, like at meal time or when you have company.    before beginning a counterconditioning regimen, you ll need to accurately identify a proper course of action. to do this, you need to consider what is causing the cat to behave in an undesirable way. most negative cat behavior manifests because of   fear aggression territorial problems  after you ve watched your cat and identified issues you d like to work on, you should write down and rank the goals of your counterconditioning program. without ranking goals, you may not work on behaviors in a logical fashion.  consider what behaviors or problems are linked together. these should be ranked accordingly. for example, if your cat has food aggression and also appears territorial, you ll need to work on these issues together.  by working on less severe issues, you ll be able to phase the cat into a counterconditioning program that eventually focuses on the most problematic or severe issues.  do things the cat is most comfortable with. for example, if a cat doesn t like to be handled by people, but does favor some people, employ those people to get your cat used to being handled. don t have people the cat doesn t favor handle it first.  whenever your cat engages in behavior that is desirable, you should reward it with a treat. by rewarding your cat with a treat, you ll set the expectation that certain behavior is desirable. as a result, the cat will be more likely to engage in behavior that earns it a reward.  give the cat their favorite snack when they engage in a behavior that is pleasing to you. work the cat into expecting a reward for good behavior. for example, if you re working with a cat that doesn t like to be handled, work toward the cat walking over and sitting in your lap to get a treat. make sure not to overfeed your cat.  almost all rewards should be paired with positive verbal reinforcement. by creating several levels of positive reinforcement, you ll help countercondition the cat quicker. in addition, the cat will more easily associate positive verbal cue with other aspects of its counterconditioning training.  start with the cat s name, if they don t know it already. employ simple words like  yes,   good,  or  hold.  pair verbal reinforcement with food rewards. for example, say  good  when you give your cat a treat. verbal reinforcement is not as useful with cats as it is with dogs.  in addition to verbal reinforcement, you may need to offer physical reinforcement. while this may not work for all cats, some cats may benefit from a pat on the back or a friendly pet on the head.  use touching along with food rewards. for example, if the cat doesn t like physical contact, pet the cat lightly after they ve come to you expecting a treat. use verbal reinforcement whenever you use physical reinforcement. by repeating phrases like  good cat  while petting the cat, you ll be conditioning the cat to a certain behavior. avoid physical contact if the cat seems averse to it. make sure you ve made progress on other parts of your counterconditioning regimen, first.  before you start any conditioning program, you need to make sure that the space you conduct it in is a calm space that is conducive to training. if it s not, your cat may be distracted, stressed, or anxious.  remove other pets or small children from the room. if for some reason they are necessary, make sure you control interaction as much as possible. for instance, create separate spaces for the cat in question and others in the room. turn off music, television, and other distractions.  the most effective counterconditioning goes beyond planned training time. to be effective, you need to make sure you include it your daily regimen. this way, you can constantly reinforce the behavior you want.  use positive verbal cues. reward positive behavior daily.  negative reinforcement may undermine your counterconditioning program by making your cat fearful or anxious. as a result, try to limit negative reinforcement to only the most necessary circumstances.  if the cat is destructive, you may need to use verbal cues like  no  or even employ a spray bottle to send the signal that the cat should not destroy an item. negative reinforcement rarely works when trying to get a cat to overcome fear of contact with humans.  perhaps the most important thing to do when counterconditioning a cat is to go as slow as you need. if your training is rushed, the cat will feel anxiety and may not result positively to your efforts.  set aside regular time every day to conduct explicit counterconditioning training. this could be as little as 10 minutes or as long as an hour. create a schedule based on realistic expectations. for example, don t expect to eliminate territorial behavior over the course of a week or even a month. the process may take months or even longer.
query	74	 spend some time observing your cat s behavior. without serious observation, you won t fully understand the problem and won t be able to determine a course of action to take. try to commit relatively significant amount of time watching how your cat behaves.  use a notebook to record undesirable behavior. for example, make a note if your cat paws you or another cat. pay special attention to what actions or events may trigger your cat s undesirable behavior. for instance, your cat may exhibit bad behavior when there is a lot of noise or tumult in the room. try to set aside some time every day to watch your cat. you may want to do this when your cat is more likely to behave poorly, like at meal time or when you have company.    before beginning a counterconditioning regimen, you ll need to accurately identify a proper course of action. to do this, you need to consider what is causing the cat to behave in an undesirable way. most negative cat behavior manifests because of   fear aggression territorial problems  after you ve watched your cat and identified issues you d like to work on, you should write down and rank the goals of your counterconditioning program. without ranking goals, you may not work on behaviors in a logical fashion.  consider what behaviors or problems are linked together. these should be ranked accordingly. for example, if your cat has food aggression and also appears territorial, you ll need to work on these issues together.  by working on less severe issues, you ll be able to phase the cat into a counterconditioning program that eventually focuses on the most problematic or severe issues.  do things the cat is most comfortable with. for example, if a cat doesn t like to be handled by people, but does favor some people, employ

query	76	 the carpal tunnel within your wrist is a narrow passageway made up of small carpal bones and ligaments. the tunnel protects nerves, blood vessels and tendons that go into your hand. the main nerve that innervates your hand is called the median nerve.avoid activities that compress and irritate the median nerve such as repetitively flexing your wrist, lifting heavy weights with your hands, sleeping with bent wrists and punching solid objects.   wearing tight bracelets and watches may be a risk factor also, so make sure to leave ample space. in many cases of carpal tunnel syndrome, a single cause is difficult to identify. often it involves a combination of factors, such as arthritis or diabetes combined with repetitive strain in the wrist. the wrist anatomy of people can make a difference   some have naturally smaller passageways in their wrists or have carpal bones that are positioned oddly.    stretching your wrists on a regular basis can be effective at reducing or minimizing carpal tunnel symptoms.in particular, wrist extensions can help make more room for the median nerve in the carpal tunnel by stretching the ligaments that attach to the carpal bones. the easiest way to extend and stretch both wrists at the same time is the  prayer pose  with your palms together. put your palms together in front of your chest and raise your elbows until you feel a nice stretch in your wrists. hold for 30 seconds and repeat 3 5x daily.   you can also grab the fingers of the affected hand and pull backwards until you feel a stretch at the front of your wrist. you may feel more temporary tingling in your hand with this stretch, but don t stop unless you feel pain. in addition to hand tingling, other symptoms commonly associated with carpal tunnel syndrome are  numbness, throbbing pain, muscle weakness and color changes  too pale or too red . the only part of the wrist   hand typically spared symptoms is the little finger   it s not innervated by the median nerve.    the symptoms of carpal tunnel are often related to having inflammation   swelling in the wrist, which either directly irritates the median nerve or crowds  pinches  it. as such, taking otc non steroidal anti inflammatories  nsaids , such as ibuprofen  motrin, advil  or naproxen  aleve , can be very helpful to reduce symptoms short term.painkillers such as acetaminophen  tylenol, paracetamol  can be used for carpal tunnel also, but they don t impact swelling, only the pain.   anti inflammatories and analgesics should be considered short term strategies for pain control. there isn t any evidence that these drugs improve carpal tunnel syndrome in the long term.taking too many nsaids or taking them for too long significantly increases your risk of stomach irritation, ulcers and kidney failure. taking too much acetaminophen or taking it for too can cause liver damage. as an alternative, rub an ointment that contains a natural pain reliever into your sore wrist   hand. menthol, camphor, arnica and capsaicin are all helpful for relieving mild to moderate pain.    if your wrist is sore and looks or feels swollen, then apply a small bag of crushed ice  or something cold  to it in order to reduce inflammation and numb the pain. doing so may also reduce hand symptoms. cold therapy is most effective for soft tissue injuries that involve some sort of swelling because it reduces blood flow.apply the crushed ice to your wrist for about 5 10 minutes 3 5x daily until the symptoms subside.   compressing the ice against your wrist with a stretchy tensor or ace bandage is even more effective for fighting inflammation. always wrap ice in a thin cloth before applying it skin   it prevents skin irritation or frostbite. if crushed ice isn t available, use a large ice cube, frozen gel pack or small bag of frozen veggies instead. in some cases, cold therapy may aggravate the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. avoid ice if that s the case with you.    wearing a rigid brace or splint that holds your wrist in a neutral position during the day may reduce the compression or irritation of the median nerve and help with carpal tunnel symptoms.splints or wrist braces can also be worn during activities that aggravate symptoms, such as working at the computer, bowling or carrying groceries. wearing splints while you sleep can help relieve nighttime symptoms of tingling and numbness in your hands, especially if you have a habit of curling your wrists.you may need to wear a splint for several weeks  day and night  to get significant relief from carpal tunnel symptoms. for some sufferers, splints and braces provide negligible benefit. splinting at night can be a good idea if you re pregnant and have carpal tunnel syndrome because pregnancy tends to increase swelling  edema  in the hands and feet. wrist splints and braces can be purchased at most pharmacies and medical supply stores.    some sleeping postures can aggravate the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.sleeping with your fists clenched and wrists tucked in  flexed  is the worst position, but having your arms extended above your head is not great either. instead, sleep on your back or side with your arms at your sides, and try to keep your hands open and your wrists in a neutral position. wearing a wrist splint or brace is very helpful in this regard, although it takes a little getting used to.   don t sleep on your stomach with your hands   wrists compressed under your pillow. people who do this frequently wake up with numb and tingly hands. most wrist splints and braces are made of nylon and fasten with velcro, which can irritate other parts of your body. consider covering your splint with a sock or thin cloth to reduce irritating other body parts.    your carpal tunnel problem may be caused or aggravated by a poorly designed work station. if your computer keyboard, mouse, desk and or chair isn t positioned properly for your height and body proportions, it can put strain on your wrists, shoulders, neck and mid back. make sure your keyboard is low enough so that your wrists are not constantly bent upwards while typing.consider getting an ergonomic keyboard and mouse, designed to take the stress off your wrists and hands.   putting cushioned pads underneath your keyboard and mouse can lessen the impact on your hands and wrists. have an occupational therapist review your body positions while performing your job. people who work on computers for many hours each day are at higher risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.  if you are feeling any carpal tunnel symptoms in your wrist and hand that persist for more than a few weeks, then see your doctor for an examination. your doctor may take x rays and blood tests to rule out other causes of wrist   hand pain, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, advanced diabetes, hairline fractures or vascular problems.   electrodiagnostic studies  emg and nerve conduction  are usually done to confirm the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome.your doctor will see if you can perform certain tasks that are difficult with carpal tunnel syndrome, such as  making a tight fist, pinching your thumb and forefinger together and manipulating small objects with precision.your doctor may ask about your profession, as certain jobs are at high risk  carpenters, cashiers, assembly line workers, musicians, auto mechanics and people who work on computers for long hours.    your doctor may recommend injecting the carpal tunnel area of your wrist with corticosteroid medication, such as cortisone, to relieve the pain, inflammation and other symptoms.corticosteroids are strong and fast acting anti inflammatories that can quickly decrease swelling in your wrist, which relieves pressure on the median nerve. taking oral corticosteroids  by mouth  is another option, but these drugs are not considered as effective as injections and they come with significant side effects.   other common corticosteroid medications used for carpal tunnel syndrome are prednisolone, dexamethasone and triamcinolone. potential complications of corticosteroid injections include local infection, bleeding, tendon weakening, local muscle atrophy and nerve irritation   damage. as such, injections are limited to 2 per year. if corticosteroid injections fail to significantly reduce the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, then surgery should be considered.    if all other remedies and treatments fail to give you relief, then your doctor will likely recommend carpal tunnel surgery. surgery should be considered as a last resort, although it can completely relieve your symptoms for good with minimal risk, so it should not be considered as a long shot. the goal of surgery is to relieve pressure on the median nerve by cutting the ligament pressing on it.however, carpal tunnel surgery can be performed in two different ways  endoscopic or open surgery.   endoscopic surgery involves uses a telescope like device with a tiny camera on the end  endoscope , which is inserted through a small incision in your wrist or hand. the endoscope can see inside the carpal tunnel and cut the problematic ligament. endoscopic surgery typically results in the least amount of pain and the quickest recovery. open surgery involves making a larger incision in the palm of your hand and over your wrist in order to cut through the problematic ligament, which frees the nerve. surgery risks include  nerve damage, infection and scar tissue formation.    following the surgery  it s done on an outpatient basis , you ll be asked to often elevate your hand above your heart and move your fingers, which reduces swelling and prevents stiffness.mild pain, swelling and stiffness in the palm and wrist can be expected post surgery for up to 6 months, and complete recovery may take a year. for the first 2 4 weeks, you may be required to wear a splint or brace, although using your hand is encouraged.   most people s symptoms get much better after surgery, but recovery is often slow and gradual. on average, hand strength returns to normal 2 months after surgery.carpal tunnel syndrome can occasionally recur  about 10  of the time  and may require additional surgery.

query	78	 the symptoms of acute hepatitis typically begin suddenly and get progressively worse over the course of several days. if you have the following symptoms, see your doctor right away anorexia fatigue fever nausea and or vomiting hives or itchy skin abdominal pain dark urine pale colored stool joint pain jaundice pruritus  itchiness     people with chronic hepatitis b and c often experience no symptoms at all, which makes these conditions much harder to diagnose. if you believe you have been exposed to viral hepatitis, you should see your doctor for testing, even if you feel fine.  for patients who do experience symptoms from chronic hepatitis, fatigue is the most common. if you have chronic fatigue, do not ignore this symptom. see your doctor for blood tests to find out if viral hepatitis is the cause.because chronic fatigue can be caused by many other conditions and is sometimes a side effect of a busy lifestyle, people do not always recognize it as a symptom of hepatitis. this can lead to delayed diagnosis, and ultimately more liver damage. chronic liver disease can lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma  liver cancer . you may need a liver transplantation or medication to control these pathologies.    viral hepatitis is sometimes caught when patients have routine lab work that reveals abnormal liver functioning. if you have lab work done, check with your doctor to find out if your liver tests are normal.if your routine lab work is abnormal, you will most likely be sent for more blood work in order to determine if you have viral hepatitis. the first test to be completed is the measurement of the ast and alt, if these enzymes are elevated then you may possibly have hepatitis. however, there are other possible causes like alcoholism and gall bladder disease.    one test that is commonly used to diagnose hepatitis is a liver enzyme test, also known as the ast and alt test. this is a simple blood test that detects elevated levels of certain liver enzymes in the blood. elevated levels suggest liver damage, which is often caused by viral hepatitis.liver damage may have other causes as well, so elevated liver enzymes do not always indicate a diagnosis of viral hepatitis. people with acute hepatitis are more likely to have extremely high enzyme levels that will subside to normal within a short amount of time, while people with chronic hepatitis are more likely to have slightly elevated enzyme levels that will remain elevated for an extended period of time.    a viral antibody test is another blood test that is commonly used to diagnose viral hepatitis. it detects the antibodies that the body s white blood cells has produced to fight the virus.in patients with acute hepatitis, viral antibodies will still be detectable even after the body has eliminated the virus. patients who have been vaccinated against hepatitis a or b will have antibodies in their blood, but this does not mean the virus is present.for the rest of a patient s life, if they get tested for viral antibodies, and have had hepatitis vaccination, then the test will show surface antigen positivity, especially with the hepatitis b vaccination.    if your blood tests are positive for viral hepatitis antibodies, your doctor may also want to look for evidence of viral proteins and or genetic material in your blood. when these are present along with antibodies, it indicates that the patient s body has not been able to fight off the virus, which may indicate a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis.if your antibody test was positive, but there is no evidence of viral proteins or genetic material, this means your body has successfully eradicated the virus.    viral hepatitis can sometimes be confused with conditions that block the bile ducts, such as gallstones or cancer of the gallbladder. even alcoholics can have unusual levels of enzymes that may need to be ruled out. your doctor may want to do an ultrasound to rule out bile duct blockage as the cause of your symptoms.  if you have tested positive for hepatitis, your doctor may want to do further tests to understand how severe the condition is and what specific type of hepatitis you have. this will help your doctor recommend the best treatment plan for you.   one of these tests is a liver biopsy, which is performed by inserting a long, thin needle through the skin and into the liver. this test measures the amount of liver damage caused by viral hepatitis.if you have been diagnosed with hepatitis c, you may need to have additional tests to identify the virus s genotype. certain genotypes are more responsive to treatment than others, so knowing which type you have will help your doctor develop an appropriate treatment plan.  the following individuals are at a higher risk for contracting hepatitis c people who have had organ transplants or blood transfusions people who have used intravenous drugs people who have had kidney dialysis people who have hiv people who have been incarcerated people who have had tattoos or piercings with dirty needles people who were treated for clotting issues with blood products before 1987 people who were born to mothers with hepatitis c people who have been exposed to the blood of an individual with hepatitis c    like hepatitis c, hepatitis b is transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids of an individual who has the virus. the following people are at a higher risk for getting hepatitis b people who had a blood transfusion or received another blood product prior to 1972 people who have had a tattoo or piercing  if an infected needle was used  people who have used intravenous drugs people who live with people who have hepatitis b people who have had multiple sex partners men who have sex with other men people who have been to areas where hepatitis b is endemic people who were born to a mother with hepatitis b people who work in the healthcare field    unlike hepatitis b and c, hepatitis a is transmitted through feces. people who do any of the following are at an increased risk of contracting hepatitis a drink contaminated water eat raw shellfish that came from contaminated water eat food that has been handled in an unhygienic way by an infected person come into contact with the feces of an infected person

query	88	 many people suffering from this disease begin using corticosteroid medications  however, they come with risks of bone fracture. discuss your options with your doctor at the onset of the disease, if possible.    exercise can lead to an increase in blood pressure and shortness of breath, so make sure you undergo tests on your cardiovascular and respiratory systems before you start doing physical therapy.   doctors may prescribe an oxygen machine, sleep apnea device or ventilators for muscular dystrophy patients that have problems with breathing. in severe cases, a pacemaker may be inserted into the body to regulate the beating of the heart.    if you are suffering from muscle weakness, your doctor may prescribe a cane, wheelchair or walker to reduce the risk of falling. your doctor may recommend that you try a full physical therapy regime first before using an aid, or they may suggest you use an aid when performing the exercises.    using a service that is requested by your doctor and supported by your health insurance company will reduce the cost of physical therapy. inquire about physical therapy appointment limits with your insurance company.    people with specialized knowledge of the condition are more likely to be effective. call several physical therapy offices to inquire about their experience with your specific type of muscular dystrophy.    it may take several weeks or months before you are able to develop an at home exercise routine. undergo an initial consultation.    under the guidance of your physical therapist, begin regular swimming, walking on flat surfaces and or bike riding. schedule exercise that is energizing, rather than tiring.   for example, schedule a 10 to 20 minute walk or swim every day rather than an hour of activity every few days. exercise that encourages cramping the next day will not have the positive impact that light to moderate exercise will. the aim of regular exercise is to keep muscles in shape. it can also reduce weight, leaving a lower burden on joints, tendons and muscles.    these prescribed exercises are tailored to your body to promote joint flexibility. doing these exercises every day is likely to increase mobility and lessen your risk of contractures.   for example, a type of range of motion exercise for the shoulders involves raising your arms over your head. you would first grasp your weaker arm with your stronger arm at the wrist, then raise it above your head. these exercises should be simple enough to begin at home and do regularly. stop the exercise immediately if it causes a severe increase in pain. you should not try to push your joints past the point where they move. sometimes, doing exercises after warming up with cardiovascular activity will increase your mobility further.    muscular dystrophy patients must adjust their exercise routine as the condition progresses. return every few months to assess any changes that need to be made in your plan.  
query	89	 progesterone only oral contraceptives are not effective in reducing acne and pimples, so combined oral contraceptives that contain both estrogen and progesterone are used. they work by reducing androgen production by the ovaries.   combined oral contraceptives are available in 21 day and 28 day packs. start on the first day of menstruation and take one each day for 21 days. then, take a one week  7 days  break or take placebo tablets for a week if it is a 28 day pack    this is a potassium sparing diuretic medication used for liver disease, heart failure and high blood pressure. however, it is also useful for treating hirsutism  excessive hair growth , acne and seborrhoea  excessive secretion of oil in the skin  due to its anti androgenic properties.   spironolactone works by blocking androgen receptors, thereby reducing the production of this hormone. the dose of spironolactone is slowly increased from 25 to 200 mg per day, taken throughout the day.    this medication works by preventing the production and blocking the effects of testosterone, which is one of the male hormones or androgens. the daily doses ranges from 25 to 200 mg.  preventing premenstrual acne and pimples through diet and lifestyle modifications focuses on reducing the levels of male hormones  androgens  such as testosterone, as they are mainly responsible for overstimulation of the sebaceous glands.    these substances can cause elevated blood sugar levels, which in turn leads to higher levels of insulin.   higher levels of insulin can stimulate a woman s ovaries to produce more androgens or male hormones such as testosterone. an increase in male hormones can stimulate an overreaction of the sebaceous gland , causing it to produce excessive oil that can cause acne and pimples.avoid foods that are high in sugar such as granulated sugars, instant sweetened teas, candies, dried fruit, cookies, cake, jam, spreads, cereals, ice cream, yogurts and shakes. also, avoid foods high in refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pasta, carbonated drinks, corn starch and grains.    according to studies, protein increases the level of androgens such as testosterone in the body by allowing greater uptake of testosterone from the blood.minimize your intake of protein rich foods such as turkey breast, fish, cheese, pork loin, tofu, lean beef, beans, eggs, yogurt, dairy products and nuts.    vitamin a has been shown to increase testosterone levels by suppressing estrogen levels. high estrogen levels cause a decrease in the production of testosterone.cut down on your intake of foods rich in vitamin a such as apricots, broccoli, carrots, mango, melon, spinach, sweet potatoes and winter squash.    vitamin d enhances the sensitivity of receptors in the androgen glands  cells that release testosterone.   minimize the intake of foods rich in vitamin d such as cod liver oil, fish, oysters, soy milk, fortified cereals, caviar, tofu, salami, dairy products, ham, sausages, eggs and mushrooms.    according to studies, tofu reduces testosterone levels by increasing sex hormone binding globulin  shbg  level. this shbg is a protein that controls testosterone levels by transporting it throughout the body.the recommended daily intake of tofu is 56 grams for men and 46 grams for women.  higher levels of insulin can stimulate a woman s ovaries to produce more androgens or male hormones such as testosterone.   fiber reduces insulin in the body by displacing some of the carbohydrates that are absorbed by the small intestine or by moving the carbohydrates to a place in the lower intestinal tract where there is less effect on insulin secretion.fiber rich foods include apples, figs, kiwi, legumes, beans, berries, peas, plums, mangoes, oats, peaches and sweet potatoes. the ideal daily intake is 21 grams.  obesity causes stress in a system of cellular membranes called the endoplasmic reticulum  er . this in turn causes the endoplasmic reticulum to suppress the signals of the insulin receptors, which then leads to insulin resistance.when the body has insulin resistance, it is unable to respond normally to the effects of insulin, therefore resulting in high levels of insulin. higher levels of insulin can stimulate a woman s ovaries to produce more androgens or male hormones, thereby overstimulating the sebaceous glands to produce more oil or sebum, resulting in the development of acne and pimples.    a higher intake of omega 3 fatty acids can reduce insulin resistance, which is a condition whereby the body is able to produce insulin but it cannot be used effectively.   our body s cells are composed of a double fat layer and these fats will dictate the efficiency of the metabolism. if healthy omega 3 fats are deposited in the cell layers, insulin will easily attach to them and this allows for improved energy utilization and increased fat burning. in this way, insulin does not build up and will stay at normal levels. this can aid in preventing premenstrual acne and pimples because the insulin level is not too high. keep in mind that higher levels of insulin can stimulate a woman s ovaries to produce more androgens or male hormones that can lead to acne and pimples. foods rich in omega 3 fatty acids are sardines, salmon, soybeans, flax seeds, walnuts, tofu, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, shrimp and winter squash. the recommended dose of omega 3 fatty acids is not more than 3 grams daily.  using harsh soaps when washing your face can irritate the hair follicles of the skin which can lead to acne or pimples. use only mild soaps. these soaps has a ph near 7.    hormonal imbalances during menstruation may lead to the overproduction of oil  sebum , leading to acne or pimples.   during the menstrual cycle, hormonal imbalances occur and may stimulate the overproduction of a certain hormones called androgens which are found in both men and women. this leads to the incidence of acne by overstimulating the sebaceous glands and altering the development of skin cells that covers the hair follicles.hormonal imbalances can also lead to irregular shedding of dead skin cells. this results in irritation of the hair follicles of the skin. this irritation can lead to the development of acne and pimples.    acne develops following the blockage of hair follicles with dead skin cells and oil. these hair follicles are attached to the sebaceous glands, which are responsible for secreting sebum  an oily substance  that lubricates the skin and hair.   normally, this oily substance moves along the hair shafts and into the opening of the hair follicles which leads to the skin surface. however, when there is an excess production of sebum as well as dead skin cells, these substances may accumulate in the hair follicles and together form a soft plug which provides the ideal environment for bacteria to grow. the formation of this plug may stimulate the walls of the hair follicles to swell, thereby producing a whitehead. alternatively, the plug may be exposed to the skin surface and become dark in color, resulting in a blackhead. when these clogged hair follicles become infected with bacteria, pimples  raised red spots on the skin with a white center  appear. if blockage and swelling occurs deep within the hair follicles and produces lumps beneath the skin surface, cysts develop.  
query	90	 because the hormone affects your heart rate, you can have a faster heartbeat, an irregular heartbeat, or a pounding heartbeat due to hyperthyroidism. you ll usually feel an irregular or pounding heartbeat, but you can check to see if your pulse is 100 bpm or more.to check your heart rate, find your pulse. use a stopwatch to time 15 seconds while counting beats. multiply that number by four to get your beats per minute. so if you have 25 beats or more in 15 seconds, you should talk to your doctor.    that is, you may be more prone to sweating or notice the heat more. you might also have hot flashes.  you may also notice a tremor in your hand, which is related to the hormone.  if you re having issues with breathing, you could have a hyperthyroid problem. pay particular attention to your breathing when you re sitting to see if you have trouble with it then.  with too much of the hyperthyroid hormone in your body, your weight can fluctuate. most people lose weight.oddly, the disease can also cause an increase in appetite.  hyperthyroidism can make you irritable. in fact, you may find your moods swing from one extreme to another. additionally, it can affect your concentration.  you may find you are having to go to the bathroom more often, and your menstrual cycles could change, either becoming heavier, lighter, or irregular.however, your periods are most likely to become lighter, or you may not have them at all.  if you find yourself exhausted or notice that you seem weaker than usual, it can also be a symptom of hyperthyroidism.  with hyperthyroidism, your thyroid can become enlarged. check for swelling near the bottom of your neck in the front.  you may notice thinning hair, brittle hair, dry skin, bulging eyes, or thinning skin.,  if you have several of the symptoms above, check with your doctor. ask to be tested for hyperthyroidism.  that is, many of these symptoms can point to other diseases, so your doctor may not immediately lean towards hyperthyroidism.  the main way to check for hyperthyroidism is to have blood drawn. your blood will then be tested for its tsh level. tsh, or the thyroid stimulating hormone, is produced by pituitary gland. if you have too much of the thyroid hormone, the level of tsh will be pushed down because the thyroid is already stimulated too much. therefore, if your level of tsh is low, you likely have hyperthyroidism.your doctor may decide to run additional tests, such as checking the levels of the thyroid hormones t3 and t4, or looking for antithyroid antibodies.    hyperthyroidism is caused by other problems, often by either graves  disease or overproducing nodules. your doctor can screen for these problems.to screen for the cause, your doctor may use radioactive iodine. your thyroid uses iodine when creating hormones, and your doctor can check to see how much iodine it has absorbed. if it absorbs too much, it means your thyroid is likely making too much of the thyroid hormone thyroxine.another way to screen for the cause is through a thyroid scan. you are injected with a radioactive substance, which allows the doctor to create an image of your thyroid.your doctor may also examine your thyroid with a thyroid ultrasound. this procedure uses sound waves to create an image of your thyroid and does not use ionizing radiation.    the purpose of antithyroid medication is to change the rate that the thyroid creates hormones by slowing it down. the main medication used today is methimazole.this treatment takes anywhere from 1 1 2 months to 3 months to work.one problem with this treatment is it doesn t always work permanently.another issue is the drugs in this category can cause liver damage. propylthiouracil is more likely to cause liver damage than methimazole, which is why it is used less often.  the point of the iodine is to shrink your thyroid glands to slow down production. it may take up to half a year to work effectively.one problem with this treatment is it can slow down production too much, so you may end up needing to take a replacement hormone.  a more extreme option is to have your thyroid removed completely using

query	107	 before embarking on a quest to find your political stance, it is important to understand your system of government, on both a local and federal level. consult books, scholarly journals, reputable web publications, or other reliable sources to reinforce your knowledge of your own political system.take the time to learn about the different branches of government, the organization of the government as a whole, and how things function within that system.  the way you were raised can affect your knowledge of, and engagement with, politics.if your family does not typically discuss political issues, stimulate the dialogue to get some insight on what their political leanings are. make sure to convey that your interest is one of genuine curiosity by approaching the topic as neutrally as possible, and by highlighting your own quest for political direction  e.g.  i m exploring my own political beliefs. would you mind sharing a bit about your own political beliefs with me   . follow with questions like     how long have you supported your political party    what platform s  won you over with this party    have your political beliefs changed over time    what issues matter to you the most      make a point to learn the history of major political parties to gain a better understanding of what they really stand for. for example, most major european and north american political parties emerged in the 19th century as groups of individuals organized to gain and exert political power.over time, the platforms  or values  of each party have shifted in response to cultural and political issues of the day. understanding how each political party in your nation originated and evolved is key to understanding whether or not you agree with their positions on important issues.  the number of major political parties varies by nation, but as a general rule most parties fall somewhere between liberal and conservative ideologies. learn what these belief structures represent to get a better sense of your own political sensibilities. liberal parties support a belief that government should guarantee equality, provide for its citizens, and alleviate social problems.conservative parties emphasize personal liberty, free markets, strong national defense, and limited government interference.also referred to as  left wing  and  right wing,  these contrasting ideologies differ greatly on many key issues. for example    gun control  liberals often advocate for stricter gun control laws and believe it is the government s role to protect citizens, while conservatives emphasize the right for citizens to bear arms and protect themselves.same sex marriage  liberals support equal marriage rights for everyone regardless of sexual orientation, while conservatives generally oppose same sex marriage.the death penalty  liberals typically view capital punishment as inhumane and want to abolish it, while conservatives believe the death penalty is an important element of the justice system and a fitting punishment for murderers.  if you have any questions about current government policies or procedures, address them directly to your elected officials using contact information available online.use any such opportunity to ask questions that break through the veil of election time slogans and promises  if you notice that a particular issue seems to have been overlooked by a party or politician, tackle it head on with a question like,  i haven t heard you comment on this particular issue so far. will you please clarify your stance on it and plans for addressing it in the near future     radio talks shows, candidate forums and debates, civic or town hall meetings, and web chats may also present opportunities to address political candidates and elected representatives directly.  staying abreast of political happenings is an excellent way to form your own opinions on the subject. watch the news, read newspapers, and consult other non partisan sources on a regular basis. in addition, look into one of the many apps available that can help you keep track of the ever changing political landscape.  there are quizzes available online that claim to assess the political typology of an individual based on their answers to a series of questions.complete a few of these quizzes and compare the results to see if they are consistent. while the results of the quiz may not be infallible, the process of completing the quiz can encourage you to contemplate certain issues on a deeper level than you have in the past.    examine the rhetoric and platforms of political figures in the media as closely as possible.watch televised debates and interviews, read newspaper articles, and consult reliable online sources to keep up with news on different political parties and issues.take note of your gut reactions and what rings true to you by asking yourself    do you agree disagree with this person political party  do you think this politician is trustworthy  do the things that this person says make sense to you, or not     your health is an issue of great importance, so consider your beliefs and priorities in this area when determining your political stance. as a general rule, conservatives support private health care, distributed by the market with minimal government interference, and believe that anyone who is capable of paying for their own health care should do so.liberals believe that healthcare is a basic right that should be distributed to all citizens by the government.liberals generally also support the legalization of physician assisted suicide and abortion, while conservatives oppose both with the belief that they devalue the sanctity of human life.  education is a topic of great importance that you should think about carefully, whether you have children or simply have strong opinions about the educational system. left wing parties believe in the public school system, and feel that the government should direct more money towards improving these schools. right wing parties tend to support a more privatized education system, where scholarships may be awarded to students for private or charter schools  public schools operating independently  the idea is that competition created by this scholarship or school voucher system will improve the quality of education.  left wing and right wing ideas about taxation and welfare are vastly different  the former supports higher taxes and a larger government to provide for the less fortunate, while the latter supports lower taxes and a small government.the left wing also supports higher taxation of people with larger incomes. consider your beliefs on this very divisive issue, as a citizen and taxpayer, to further evaluate your overall public stance.    liberal and conservative beliefs differ greatly on environmental issues, particularly on the subject of climate change. liberals believe that global warming is the result of excessive burning of fossil fuels and support laws to reduce carbon emissions  along the same lines, they believe that the government should subsidize programs to find alternative energy sources. many conservatives dismiss the notion that humans can have that effect on the climate and oppose laws to reduce emissions.do some research to better understand the science behind these issues, which will allow you to assess your own beliefs about them. consult sources like    newspaper and scholarly journal articles reputable websites documentary films on the topic    the structure of us government is complex, so try reading up on it to gain a better understanding before choosing a political party to support. give extra attention to the history of major political parties  the us is essentially a two party system, so getting acquainted with the background and evolution of the republican and democratic parties is a good idea.keep abreast of current issues that the parties clash on  e.g. gun control, immigration laws, etc. .    as a general rule, republican platforms are based on conservative beliefs, while democratic platforms reflect liberal ideology.nonetheless, the best way to understand where each party falls on important issues is to research and organize information in a clear way  since democrats and republicans tend to fall on opposite ends of most issues, this kind of comparison works well. try starting with a basic  for  and  against  list, with information like    republicans  for lower taxes, smaller government, the death penalty, free market health care  against long term welfare, gun control, same sex marriage democrats  for higher taxes, larger government, gun control, welfare  including long term welfare   against privatized health care and education, the death penalty    while the democratic and republican parties have dominated the united states political system since the mid 1800s, 52 other parties exist. while third parties are often regarded as a wasted vote, they have held their own in the us with the support of citizens who are unsatisfied with the country s two dominant parties.the most active third parties in the us are    the libertarian party  the third largest political party in government  promotes reduced government involvementthe green party  a party focused primarily on environmental and social justice issuesthe

query	111	 a ballad is a poem or song that focuses on a specific story. often, ballads are about love  either lost or found   or about an event or interaction that says something about the human condition. they are thought of as romantic and are often tragic. reading ballads by other writers can be very helpful when you are trying to come up with your own ballad.traditional british ballads can be funny, tragic, or even satirical, often tackling themes like love, work, and death. like newspapers, they are impersonal in tone   regardless of how sensational the story is.  british broadsides  so called because of the paper they used to be printed on  are more topical  i.e. journalistic , addressing events and issues of the day. these are often told from a first person perspective, have stereotypical characters, and aren t very objective.  north american ballads also deal with love, scandal, violence, and disaster and are often categorized by the groups who sing them, whether they be miners, sailors, or cowboys, native americans, etc. classic north american ballads include  john henry  and  casey jones.   ballads tell stories that often tackle themes like scandal, love, death, disaster, or even current events. they usually follow a clear, linear storyline, relying on plotted action  an unsettled situation, a climax, and a resolution  to build suspense. since many tell  or retell  traditional stories that have been circulating for generations, you can also adapt a well known tale to ballad form if you don t wish to write one from complete scratch.   often, the theme of the ballad will make us feel a certain way about our own lives. tragic ballads that focus on lost love are meant to remind us to be grateful of the lives we lead and the love we experience.  the topic can range from a significant historical event that affected thousands, to a small, personal moment you had in your own life. once you have chosen a particular event or person s  to focus on, do a bit of research so that you can pick which parts of the story you want to tell, and which are unnecessary for the advancement of the narrative and theme.    ballads use a narrative style known as  leaping and lingering    that is, skipping over non essential plot points so that more time can be spent on the interesting moments. to mimic this style, cut any unnecessary backstory, plot connections, or secondary details that distract from the plot of the story you ve chosen.   stagger lee, the example ballad for this article, is a classic american blues ballad about the murder of billy lions at the hand of stagger lee, who overreacted when billy knocked the hat from his head. salacious stories like this usually make for very popular ballads.    the opening line of a ballad is often the hardest to write, but it is also the most important, because it is what draws the reader or listener in and makes him or her feel like he she a part of the story. ballads often open with stock phrases such as the come ye all salutation.  ex.  come all ye maidens,   come all ye comrades,  etc.  feel free to borrow this phrase to get your story going  and make your ballad more authentic to boot . if you don t want to use a starter phrase, focus on introducing the reader to the story..    mississippi john hurt s version of stagger lee jumps right into the action by opening with,police officer, how can it be      ballads typically have four line verses, of which two or more rhyme.  blues ballads, on the other hand, often have two rhyming lines followed by a third, independent line.  the easiest way to get started with the rhythm and rhyme is to complete the first verse however you like it, then use it as the basis for the rest of the lines in the verse  ex. keeping the length, rhythm, and end rhyme of each line more or less consistent .   an aa rhyme is when the first and second line rhyme. aabb  the first two lines are a rhyming pair and the second two lines are a new rhyming pair. abab  the first and third line rhyme and the second and fourth line rhyme. abcb  only the second and fourth lines rhyme. example from stagger lee  the first three lines are aab, which is the traditional blues ballad rhyme scheme.  police officer, how can it be  you can  rest everybody but cruel stagger lee that bad man, cruel stagger lee.     once again, the chorus is very flexible in ballad form. it can be one line that is repeated in every verse, two lines that are repeated every few verses, an entire verse, or even two verses back to back. additionally, you can repeat the chorus verbatim or change it slightly each time for dramatic effect.   this version of stagger lee includes the chorus at the end of every verse  the chorus is that bad man, oh cruel stagger lee  police officer, how can it be  you can  rest everybody but cruel stagger leethat bad man, oh, cruel stagger lee     use a consistent meter  i.e. try to keep the same lyrical rhythm as you did in the first verse . the meter is basically the pattern of syllables in a song or poem. most ballads use the same meter throughout the song, or the meter for the chorus may differ from that of the verses. this is what dictates the rhythm. this following poem has 3 lines, other than typical 4 lined ballads. by extending the sentences to other lines, you will be able to see it morph into a poem looking ballad.   billy de lyon told stagger lee,  please don t take my life, i got two little babies, and a darlin  lovin  wife.  that bad man, oh, cruel stagger lee    once you have the verse style down, you just need to complete your story following the same structural guidelines you. don t be a slave to that structure, though. if you need to vary the length of a line or even of a verse here and there, go ahead and do it, and if you want to deviate from your rhyme pattern feel free to do so if it will make your ballad better.    what i care about you little babies, your darlin  lovin  wife  you done stole my stetson hat, i m bound to take your life.  that bad man, cruel stagger lee  boom boom, boom boom,  went the forty four when i spied billy de lyon, he was layin  down on the floor that bad man, oh cruel stagger lee  gentlemen of the jury, what do you think of that  stagger lee killed billy de lyon about a five dollar stetson hat.  that bad man, oh, cruel stagger lee. and all they gathered, hands way up high, at twelve o clock they killed him, they re all glad to see him die that bad man, oh, cruel stagger lee    in these cases, the rhyme scheme is often aab  see above  or abac  where the two line chorus occupies the second and fourth lines, b and c, of each verse .   lines that  go together  should have roughly the same number of syllables and accented syllables.    while this is the most common ballad form, occasionally you ll find a ballad with, say, 6 lines, or one with a varying number of lines per verse.   note that there are cases where the rhythm or the cadence of the ballad is more important than the rhyme.    give yourself some time to focus on other things before coming back to edit the ballad. clearing your head of the story and the rhythm will allow you to look at the ballad with new eyes when you begin editing.    perhaps you couldn t find the right rhyme, or there were just too many syllables and you didn t know how to get rid of them. see if you can fix them now. cut out any unnecessary verses, leaving only what the story needs.    whether or not you plan to put your ballad to music, you should still read your poem out loud. reading out loud will help you to locate parts of the poem that might sound awkward. if you trip over a verse, you will know that you will have to tweak the amount of syllables or rhyme also make sure you can sing it because most ballads were sung in the olden times.    don t tell him or her anything about the story  see if she he can pick up the plot and themes on his her own. you want your audience to be able to understand what you re trying to say. ballads are not simply songs  they are stories that teach the audience life lessons.    many ballads get made into songs, though they are also lovely when left simply as a poem to be shared with others. if you have a musical ear, try putting your ballad to some music.

query	117	 as soon as the tournament teams are announced, read sports sites and blogs to figure out the scuttlebutt on all the promising and not so promising teams. look for information on programs  late season injuries, winning and losing streaks, and post season playing history, which may indicate how a team approaches high pressure elimination games.   look for teams ranked really high who have been badly blown out in a loss during the regular season   these teams are statistically unlikely to win it all. highly ranked teams who have suffered a blowout loss of double digits are statistically less likely to win it all. look for teams who score high on basketball analytics. sites such as kenpom offer a purely objective look at teams based on different metrics. of course, these sites can t measure intangibles, but looking at them can be a good way to figure out which teams may be better, or worse, than they actually appear. don t limit yourself to one particular site. national news may not have access to local details, while regional information can carry a heavy hometown bias.    the running joke among office pool participants is that the person with the least knowledge of the sport always wins the march madness pool. while it can happen  and is extremely frustrating  there s really no advantage in being ignorant. a lot of luck goes into the games themselves, but having good background information will give you an edge. you ll start to see which players step up in big games, which coaches have proven track records and who can t win away from their own arena. this knowledge will come in handy.    take seeding, or a team s rank, into account, but don t be a slave to it  there are often upsets, most notably in the number five to number 12 match ups in the first round. use your bracket s point system to maximize your gains, as some award more points based on the winning team s initial seeding.   know the trends. entering the 2008 tournament, no. 1 seeds are 92 0 against 16s. even if you think that a no. 16 will win this year, the odds say that you re probably wrong. it s not that you re not brave  it s that it s just not worth taking that sort of risk. in fact, don t risk taking any team above the 12 seed in the first round unless you re absolutely sure it s a mismatch. if you pick a 13, 14, 15, or 16 seed to win in the first round, you re picking against a team that  based on seeds  should be going to the sweet 16 as long as they take care of business. however, also realize that 12 v. 5 and 11 v. 6 games are upset city. usually at least one of each will win, so be on the lookout for which ones you think can make it past the first round. know that 10 v. 7 games are hardly upsets and 9s actually have a winning record over 8s since the beginning of the 65 team era. ignore rank completely starting in the elite eight. one study has shown that the tournament s last three rounds are statistical toss ups.  pay attention to teams  rebounding statistics, which indicate a team s ability to judge shot quality and capitalize on opponents  mistakes with second chance points and fast breaks.    study teams  offensive stats  free throws and three point shooting can be important factors in closing games and in overcoming deficits quickly, while assists can indicate the ability to create opportunities and adjust to opponents  defensive weaknesses, as well as the capacity to work well as a team.    focus on teams that can play both a zone and a man to man defense, and therefore adapt easily to the variety of teams they might face during the tournament.   look at teams who can execute a full court press. full court press is a little more popular in college basketball than it is in the pros, but it can translates to a couple more steals and fast break points per game.    try to find out the picks other people in your pool are making and deviate when reasonable  choosing an unpopular team might seem daunting, but if they win, so will you. remember  no risk, no reward.   be conservative about picking first round upsets. while gloriously satisfying when they work, they often cause you to eliminate a team that in all probability will go several rounds. save your upsets for the second or third rounds. there s usually one dark horse team that goes completely unnoticed by the national media until they blow through the tournament and upset a no. 1 or no. 2 seed on their way to the final four. study past dark horse teams, their coaches, their metrics, and make a judgment about their intangibles. in 2010, the dark horse team was butler, who entered the tourney as a 5 seed. in 2011, the dark horse team was vcu, who buzzed into the final four as an astonishing 11 seed.      unless your favorite team or alma mater is a powerhouse, don t throw away logic to show your allegiance to it. if you can t bring yourself to pick against your team, don t fill out a bracket. you can root for them to win it all  that would be a much better memory than winning your office pool anyway , but don t pick them to go all the way if you don t really believe it s going to happen.    fill out several different brackets with slight differences. that way, the bracket that you lost in a pool of friends will not be the same bracket that you use in a pool of colleagues. many people fill out close to a dozen different brackets to increase their chances of winning.    when in doubt, go with your gut. and most importantly, root from your heart   the tournament is more fun that way    when you win, consider using the money to take everyone out for beers, or some other way to show you are smart enough to be an individual achiever but generous enough to be part of a team.  
query	118	 online travel agencies  ota  are online booking resources that allow you to conveniently compare airline offerings in one central location just by entering your travel dates and destination.most ota s have access to the flight inventory from various airlines which provides a way to view numerous flight options in one location. because of the large volume of business conducted by the ota s they are able to offer you the ability to search for flights without charging you a fee.one of the major benefits of otas is that the traveler is often exposed to more options than they knew they had, such as different flights, different routes, or different locations. perks include low rates on last minute tickets as well as packaged deals that include drastically reduced rates on hotel or car rentals.it s important to consider all of your needs and all of your savings options when considering using an ota. you should never pay more for a ticket on an ota site than you would from the airline s direct website. in fact, many airlines guarantee the lowest rate possible. popular ota sites include makemytrip.com, expedia.com, and booking.com.    a supplier website is a website that is owned directly by the airline, such as american airlines or delta. the decrease in use of otas over the past few years has seen a resurgence in people booking flights directly through the airline website. the primary advantage is cost, with more airlines offering special packages or resort credits that are otherwise not offered on third party sites.many airlines have spent millions of dollars updating their websites to allow for customization of flight options such as priority boarding or wi fi access. however, these luxuries are often offered at an additional cost. one of the drawbacks to utilizing a supplier website is that comparing prices can be time consuming and cumbersome.    metasearch engines are search engines that pull indices  or the databases of relevant sites  from many search engines such as google or bing.this allows the traveler to access a variety of information regarding airlines, flights, and costs all in one central location. the user can then take advantage of any specials, sales, or promotions being offered by an airline. the traveler is routed to the airline website when they are prepared to book their flight.   popular metasearch engines include google flight search, hipmunk, and hopper.one disadvantage is that not all airlines  especially smaller ones  are part of the metasearch engine s database. for example, southwest airlines has opted out of having their prices displayed on such search engines.another disadvantage is that certain airlines pay to have their information listed at the top of the page, so sometimes the information provided by a metasearch engine may appear biased.    though it may be time consuming, it may be worth it to compare prices among otas, airline websites, and metasearch engines. by comparing each search, you ll be able to see if any provider is adding additional fees or if a provider is offering a special promotion.   this works well if your travel plans  date time  are firm. otherwise, you could get overwhelmed by all of the options presented.    when you visit a website to check flight prices, the information is transmitted to the airline website in the form of a cookie. if a particular flight is repeatedly searched, sites will increase the price of the flight to scare you into booking a flight. use private browsing to avoid a hike in price.if using google chrome or safari, enable incognito by hitting command  control if using a pc , shift,  n.  for firefox or explorer, active private browsing by hitting command  control if using a pc , shift,  p.  start with a clean slate for each flight search by closing out the incognito window. your cookies reset each time your incognito window is closed.    the best window for booking a flight is 6 8 weeks before your departure. if booking during peak seasons, purchase your flight about 3 months in advance. avoid booking too early because airlines will often lower fares based on lack of demand. likewise, avoid purchasing tickets too late because fares typically rise as the departure date approaches.international flights differ slightly. they typically open up for sale about 335 days prior to departure and the price remains relatively the same for a few months. the price slowly begins to increase until about the 90 day mark when prices jump rapidly.research has found that tuesday around midnight is the cheapest time to purchase your ticket, with the average savings being about 6 . however, it s only applicable to 1.6  of the us market. the  always book at midnight  advice is a myth. prices actually increase on days that fall later in the week. avoid booking later at night and later in the week when the price of tickets has been known to increase. this spike in cost is most likely due to airlines  sales weeks ending right before the weekend.    sign up for an airline rewards program that allows you to collect points and rewards as you travel. you can cash in your rewards for free flights, free upgrades, and free companion tickets. even if you don t fly often, you can earn rewards by shopping at partner stores, watching for special offers, or getting a credit card which offers rewards.us based airlines usually partner with other international carriers. for example, a flight on singapore airlines could earn you rewards with united airlines because they are partners. airlines partner with major companies to offer rewards based on dollars spent. amazon, apple, best buy, and target offer anywhere from 2 4 points per dollar spent and even offer bonuses for monthly totals. newsletters often advertise special offers that aren t noted on an airline s website. for example, you may earn points just by installing a search tool bar or double points by flying a particular route. some credit cards offer travel rewards already. if not, try applying for a travel rewards credit card. instead of paying cash for bills and other expenses, charge everything to the card to receive rewards for paying bills as usual.    take advantage of discounts offered by clubs or organizations of which you may be a member. for example, there are many discounts codes for students. never be afraid to ask an agent if discounts are available or to use search engines to find promotional  promo  codes.mailing lists are a great way to get  members only  benefits. because cheap flight deals are usually only advertised for 24 hours, mailing lists help to ensure that you will be aware of all specials.    airline ticket prices vary based on the day of the week, time of the year, and approaching holidays. if your arrival and departure dates aren t rigid, try flying out during the middle of the week versus weekends. additionally, try to book early morning or late night flights which are typically much cheaper because few prefer to travel during these times.even one day of travel can make a difference. sometimes the cost of an extra night in a hotel is cheaper than the difference in the cost of flights. sites like skyscanner allow you to get a quick visual of prices for the entire month so you can search for the cheapest during any given month.  a few years ago, if you wanted to travel between continents you were forced to choose a  major  airline like delta or american airlines. the last few years have seen the emergence of budget airlines that offer long haul routes between continents. in america, there are only a few budget airlines, but in europe and asia there are many  the competition has helped to keep prices low . try budget companies such as wow air or air asia x to find rates as low as  30 one way.these airlines tend to offer fewer perks but what you save in price can more than make up for the lack of extras. be very careful to avoid fees. this is how these smaller airlines make money so be sure to follow the rules to avoid gigantic fees.    there are many so many budget airlines around the world that sometimes it s more economical to take a low cost flight to a nearby city, and then take a budget flight to your destination. for example, instead of choosing a direct flight to amsterdam, try taking a cheaper flight to london, and an even cheaper budget flight from london to amsterdam.this option does take more work than others as you have to review many different routes and airlines. additionally, this option can increase your total travel time, but many believe the savings are worth it.    this option only works for travelers who are looking to go  anywhere but home.  if you are open to various destinations, you can choose a country or city based on great deals. there are always airline deals on wonderful and exotic destinations around the world  if you re flexible about your destination, you can always score a great deal.kayak and google flights have features that will show you the cheapest routes and fares based on your airport of departure.

query	120	 when you applied for your b1 visa, your employer in your home country had to submit a letter to the uscis that explained why you needed to travel to the u.s. you should keep a copy of this letter with you at all times.this letter includes information regarding the reason for your travel and the types of activities you will be conducting while in the u.s. your letter also includes information related to your employment in your home country, and may include attachments to prove you are, for example, on a foreign company s payroll while you are traveling in the u.s. if you plan to stay in the u.s. for more than 90 days, you also should carry documentation with you that proves your nonimmigrant intent in visiting the u.s. and your continued foreign residency and connections.    the uscis provides a list of specific activities you are allowed to conduct while in the u.s. on a b1 business visa. these are generally business related activities in connection with your employment in your home country.generally speaking, these activities include reviewing and signing a contract, meeting with clients of your employer, or activities related to a sales or manufacturing contract, such as inspecting or overseeing a facility. under no circumstances are you allowed to draw a salary or be directly employed by a u.s. company. this can be a problem if, for example, you are a managerial employee of an international company and are visiting offices in the u.s. in these circumstances, uscis agents may consider you to be employed in the u.s. if you re staying for an extended period of time and an american is your direct supervisor.    if you are in the u.s. on a b1 visa and want to do something that isn t included on the list of eligible activities, you must apply for a change of status first. you cannot begin the prohibited activity until your application is approved.for example, if you are in the u.s. on a b1 visa and want to take some university classes while you are here, you cannot do so until you ve applied for an adjustment of status from business visa to student visa. if you have a b1 visa, you ll use form i 539 for an adjustment of status. you can download this form from the uscis website along with instructions. do not enroll in any courses at an american college or university until your application has been approved. otherwise, your enrollment will be considered a violation of your b1 business visa and your visa will immediately become void.    if you have any questions or concerns about activities you re conducting   or need to conduct   while you re in the u.s., an experienced immigration attorney can help you evaluate your circumstances.if you re unfamiliar with immigration attorneys, you might ask business associates for a recommendation   particularly those from your home country who have immigrated to the united states. you also might consider talking to anyone who helped you with the process of applying for your b1 visa. this is an especially good option if your employer has an international travel department that worked on getting your visa to travel to the u.s. most immigration attorneys provide a free initial consultation, so you can use that time to figure out your options and decide what your next steps need to be.    generally, h 1b visas are available for temporary workers who want to work in the u.s. for a short period of time but have no intent to become permanent residents.one of the most essential criteria is that you must have a valid employer employee relationship with the person or entity that files a petition on your behalf. if you are a business owner, you may be able to establish this relationship by proving that the employer filing your petition has the right to control your employment. for example, you may own your own business in your home country, but be working with a larger corporation in the u.s. you are required to come into the offices at a certain time each day and be on site certain days of the week. the u.s. employer has control over your employment. most commonly, h 1b visa holders have at least a bachelor s degree and are working in a field related to their course of study.    to be eligible for an h 1b visa, you must have a u.s. employer to sponsor you. that employer must complete an i 129 petition and submit it to the uscis on your behalf.your employer can download the i 129 form from the uscis website. the form is six pages long and includes an additional page for explanations. there are instructions for the form in a separate document, also available on the uscis website. your employer must submit supporting documents along with the petition. these documents will vary depending on the information your employer needs to support. generally your employer must provide documents that prove the employer employee relationship. the petition and supporting documents must be filed as soon as possible. delays in receiving the petition can result in complications and problems with your application.    to change your immigration status to one that allows you to work in the u.s., you must apply for a change in status with the uscis. for b1 visa holders, this is accomplished using form i 539.you ll have to provide information about you, your current visa status, and the change you are requesting. you also must answer a series of yes no questions. make sure you answer these questions truthfully, and submit supporting documentation where necessary. you may want to make a list of all supporting documentation you need so you can gather those documents together and make copies. don t send originals to the uscis   you won t get them back.    your forms and all supporting documents must be mailed to the uscis at the appropriate lockbox along with any filing fees. check the uscis website to find out which lockbox you should use.get a cashier s check or money order to cover your filing fees    290 for a form i 539 and supporting documents. your check must be drawn on a u.s. bank and payable in u.s. currency. make your check out to  u.s. department of homeland security.  do not abbreviate any part of the name of the department, or use initials. make a copy of the entire packet, including the check, for your records before you mail it. mail your application using u.s. first class mail only.    once your application is received, you ll get a receipt notice from the uscis in the mail. the notice includes an application number along with an estimated processing time.keep in mind that you cannot start working for the u.s. employer who filed a petition on your behalf until your application is approved. once you have this number, you can register on the uscis website to receive automatic notifications when your application status changes in any way. keep in mind that the issuance of h 1b visas is limited to 65,000 per year, and this limit is met quickly. some people, such as those working at universities, are not subject to this cap. if you re applying later in the year, you may have to wait an entire year or longer for your application to be considered. make sure an h 1b visa number is available at the time you apply.    the uscis may require proof of return travel arrangements prior to granting your b1 business visa. if circumstances change and you need to extend your stay, you should make new travel arrangements back to your home country.return travel arrangements help prove that you do not intend to immigrate to the u.s., and have plans to return home after a short stay. if your initial return travel arrangements don t take place until after your b1 business visa expires, the uscis may interpret that as a sign that you intended to overstay your visa from the outset. keep in mind that if the uscis determines that anything in your original visa application was false, it can rescind your visa. then you must leave the country immediately or be considered in violation of your visa.    your passport must remain valid for the entirety of your stay in the u.s. this means if you need to extend your stay, you need to make sure your passport will be valid for the duration of the extended time you request.keep in mind that if your passport expires while you are in the u.s., you may not be able to re enter your home country. if you need to extend your b1 business visa and your passport will be expiring soon, you may have to travel back to your home country to renew your visa and then return. keep in mind that a b1 business visa normally becomes void when you leave north america, so you d have to apply for a new one. talk to a uscis agent or an experienced immigration attorney about your ability to travel back to your home country and return with a b1 business visa.    the important deadline is the date your i 94 travel document expires. the date of the expiration of any visa stamps on your passport is irrelevant.your i 94 document was issued by a border patrol agent at the port of entry when you entered the u.s. if you no longer have a copy, you can download one from the u.s. customs and border patrol website. if your original b1 visa allows you to stay in the country for anywhere from four to six months, you should generally avoid filing an application for an extension within the first 90 days you re in the country. when you file an extension soon after you enter the country, the uscis may interpret this as a sign that you were planning on extending it when you made your initial application. processing an extension can take time. if you need to extend your stay without first leaving the u.s., apply for an extension at least 45 days before the expiration date on your i 94. if your reasons for needing an extension came up at the last minute, contact an experienced immigration attorney as soon as possible   particularly if you re worried your application won t be received before your current visa expires.    your application must be accompanied by proof of the reasons you need to extend your stay in the u.s., that you can support yourself financially, and that you have plans to return home.you also must include documentation that proves your ties to your home country. this could be the deed to a home or an active lease. the presence of close family and continuing employment in your home country also can prove that you have no intention of immigrating to the u.s. proof could include, for example, a letter from your employer in your home country that explains the reasons that you need to remain in the u.s. for a longer period of time and discusses your continued employment and pay.    to extend the period of time you remain in the u.s. under a b1 business visa, you must file form i 539. this form is used to adjust status, but it also is used to request an extension of an existing temporary visa.you can download a form i 539 from the uscis website. fill it out completely and accurately, and submit it along with the required filing fee  a u.s. check or money order for  290, made out to the u.s. department of homeland security  and supporting documentation. you can find the address to which you should mail your application for an extension on the uscis website. the uscis uses lockboxes located all over the country, and which one you need to use depends on where you are located. make a copy of everything you re submitting to the uscis for your records before you submit it, then mail the entire package using u.s. first class mail.    it will take at least 90 days for the uscis to process your application. if your b1 visa expires in the meantime, you generally will still be considered  in status   that is, you won t be violating your visa  while you wait.you ll get a receipt notice in the mail when the uscis has officially received your application materials. this notice includes a number that you can use to get updated information on the status of your case. you can register for status notifications online, or call the uscis customer service center at 1 800 375 5283. if anything happens while you re waiting for a decision, such as an emergency that requires you to travel back to your home country or elsewhere, you may want to visit www.infopass.uscis.gov to schedule an infopass appointment and speak to a uscis agent in person.

that are listed on your university website.    question your teachers and academic counselors about careers, majors, and the college industry. make sure to also speak with people who know you well  your friends, parents, and relatives. these people may be able to give you valuable advice about your strengths and weaknesses. don t choose a major just because someone tells you to, and make sure that you take every suggestion with a grain of salt   but don t be afraid to look for inspiration.   speak with people who have already completed certain majors. ask for their perspective. find out what they might do differently. talk to advisers from your chosen college. you can find a lot of information on the web about different majors. however, it s best to talk to a professional adviser. they can help answer questions about any department that you re considering joining.    this varies widely from college to college. some schools require that you decide upon a major by the time that you set foot inside your first class. other schools may variably give you one year, two years, or more to declare. if you are uncertain, try to take your time before committing to a singular focus. if you have the freedom to explore, take the opportunity to sample a wide variety of courses and majors that catch your eye   if you don t have a major or a goal in mind, college can be a very expensive way to find yourself. think about taking a gap year, working full time, or fulfilling your general education requirements at a community college before committing to a four year degree.you can save money and travel the world  you can volunteer or work abroad  you can audit classes for free, or attend school part time  you can try to join the workforce in a field that sounds interesting, then use that experience to inform your college major decision. do it your way remember that you don t need to go to college right away just because a lot of other people are doing it. consider whether you are being shepherded into this. do you know what you want to get out of your college experience  is it your choice, or is it your parents      there are probably a few majors that jump out at you from the start. begin by exploring what it might mean to pursue those degrees. if you love to write, then it is natural to gravitate toward a creative writing degree, or toward another of the humanities. if you love to solve problems, then you might find yourself drawn to engineering or the sciences. let the answer be simple  think about what you already love to do.   on the other hand, you may find your calling in a major that you initially dismiss. you may not discover your love for economics until you take an introductory econ class. trust your gut, but keep an open mind. it can be hard to trust your gut when you are drawn to several different majors. what if you can see yourself happily majoring in biology, music, or computer science  remember that you can always mix majors and minors. you can even choose a double major, if you re up to the challenge     ask yourself where you want to be in five years. consider the sort of life that you want to live. what is important to you  perhaps you want to make a lot of money  fight climate change  write a novel  work with numbers, or work with people  change the world, or just make a living. you may not have a lot of concrete answers, but

college, or finishing up high school, or not in school at all  visit a university and sit in on a few courses that sound interesting. find specific classes in the  courses  or  undergraduate programs  section of the university website. email the instructor and ask about auditing. in many cases, you ll be able to sit in on a class for an entire semester, for free, as long as you stay engaged and don t disrupt the professor.the instructor s name and contact information should be listed on the website alongside the course description. if you can t find the contact information, search the department website or run a web search for the professor. if a school has very large lectures hundreds of people in one room you might not even need to reach out to the professor. accompany a friend to a big lecture, or just filter in with the enrolled crowd. this can be a great, free way to feel out a course.    most colleges have some deadline by which point you must officially choose a major. this may be one year, two years, or more. it is good to be intentional about this decision, and to choose a major that you like. however, you may find that the act of declaring a focus makes it much easier to see what you want and don t want. once you ve spent a semester taking classes and trying to work toward a certain major, you ll have a much better idea of what it means to pursue that degree.choose something that excites you. don t just pick a major at random from the catalog. be honest with yourself, and give it a real shot.    once you choose a major, you ve effectively stated your purpose, and you ve given yourself a track for moving forward in college. you have not, however, locked yourself into anything irreversible. many people change their majors several times before they settle upon something. some people even go back for a second degree. try to keep perspective.  remember that you can always change course  if you aren t happy with the major that you pick, you can switch to something more fulfilling. if your college doesn t offer the major that you want, you can always transfer to another school. there is always a way out. don t be afraid to dive into a major that interests you, even if you aren t 100 percent certain.   you may find that it s easy to switch between similar majors. for instance, many classes may overlap between the english degree path and the comparative literature path. you may find a lot of common ground between the biology track and the environmental science track.the general education requirements  ges  are usually fairly similar across a  department  or  school  within a university. for instance, many of the introductory classes for the mechanical engineering track probably apply to other tracks within the engineering department. biology, chemistry, and physics degree paths often require some mixture of the same introductory science courses.    many college degrees organize classes and students under broad themes and concepts, giving you plenty of room to define your own focus. choose a concentration within the major. supplement with a double major, if you can handle the workload. pursue a minor  or two   that gives you an outlet for your other interests. don t be afraid to engage with a degree path and make it your own.
query	123	 lincoln may have had a lot of folk sense in him, but he never turned down an opportunity to look civilized and classy. his dress of choice was always a black overcoat. so long as the coat doesn t have any visible logos or symbols, you can use any black overcoat for this.look at existing lincoln costumes or pictures of the man himself and decide if any coat you have fits the bill.   a grey vest underneath may help to round off your costume.however, if you can t find one of those, a white dress shirt will do. you may also choose to button up your overcoat.    top hats can be found at costume or consignment stores, or made by rolling black felt and gluing on a rim. provided you re aiming for a traditional lincoln costume, you should keep the hat black. top hats often come with pre fabricated lincoln costumes.if you can t find a top hat, make your own. roll black construction paper into a tube. stand it up on another sheet of black construction paper, and trace the circle around the bottom  use a pencil so the silvery graphite will show up . fold the paper in half so that the circle is exactly in half, cut out the circle, and cut a second circle out around the edge, so that you end up with a brim for your top hat. tape it to the black tube.    although they won t attract as much attention as your coat or top hat, it s nonetheless a good idea to round off your costume with a good set of black shoes. the most important thing is that your shoes are black  this way they won t conflict with the rest of the costume. shoes with a buckle are rarer today than they were then, but they also match the costume if you have them lying around.   lincoln wore size 14 shoes. lincoln s father was a shoemaker.  they are not commonly worn in fashion today but you can usually find them for sale at department stores and costume shops. bowties don t need to be done up perfectly. rather, an imperfect bowtie will give your costume that much more character. lincolns bowties were obviously hand tied, but pre tied bowties are available as well if you don t want to bother with the tying process.to hand tie a bowtie, loop the bowtie around your neck, leaving a few inches more on one side. draw the longer end under the other side of your tie and loop it through the center, tightening it as you go along. bring the longer end of the bowtie over the other end and pinch them in the middle, looping the longer end through a hole at the back. tighten it gently.  lincoln s beard was arguably his most distinctive attribute. his beard was based around the chin and allowed to grow quite bushy, without hiding his shirt collar.look at pictures of lincoln s beard and groom your facial hair to match this. you can also make a fake beard with construction paper or brown felt. use spirit gum to attach it to your face.   although he s remembered for his beard, there were points in his life where abraham lincoln shaved his beard. a woman named grace bedell convinced him to grow it out. this had the effect of making lincoln look more trustworthy and warm.  eyebrows are a distinctive trait of lincoln s.although not quite as iconic as the beard, they

brown construction paper. from there, you can glue them to your face using spirit gum.    lincoln had a very striking face, with sunken cheeks and protruding cheekbones. one way to replicate this look is by using stage makeup. you should first suck n your cheeks. this way, you ll be able to see where the contours of your face are. next, take a grey or brown stage makeup and apply it to the area that s sucked in. blend the edges with your fingers.   because  gaunt cheek  makeup is usually reserved for horror costumes, it s a good idea to be very moderate with the makeup you use here, provided you re going for a  realistic  lincoln.you can try different variations on makeup to create different looks. a  zombie  abe lincoln can be done by using lots of white with black around the eyes.  lincoln was known for preferring to keep his hair unruly, as opposed to smooth. if your hair length is approximately that of lincoln s, you should tousle it up by rubbing your hands coarsely through it. if your hair is quite long, you can get some of the same untidy impression by trapping all of your hair under your top hat and letting a few strands hang loose.    there are endless creative ways you can spruce up a costume once you have the basics down. because abraham lincoln was a politician, you might consider making a pin that says  vote abraham lincoln  on it and pinning it to your jacket. the real lincoln was also often seen holding pocket watches, so adding one to your costume may be a good idea for the fake of authenticity.   a walking cane is always a good add on to a costume of this nature.    a good costume maker won t be limited to the most obvious costume solutions. in truth, there s a virtually endless amount of ways you can make yourself look like lincoln,

body. this approach can be called the  paper raham lincoln  costume.   don t underestimate the effect of multiple layers in a fake materials based costume. for instance a  dress shirt  underneath the cardboard coat could be made by cutting out some of the cardboard in the middle and gluing white construction paper    this often takes the form of combining the costume with a skirt and heels in order to feminize it. the  babe raham  lincoln costume is a well known example of this. you can exchange the big coat and pants for a black skirt and blouse. the only part of the original costume you should keep is the hat and chin beard.   the baba raham lincoln costume is a spoof of  sexy  versions of halloween costumes. it can be worn by men and women alike.    because there are countless things you can do with a costume, don t be afraid to splice your abe lincoln design with other costumes. for instance, a cute cat costume can be merged with a lincoln costume by taking the whiskers and ears, and throwing them together with the chin beard and top hat. if you have a stockpile of costume materials, you should experiment with different combinations using what you already have.   you

when you do speak, you should do so with force and conviction. this manner of speaking is a good part    if you want to go the extra mile, try to nail his likely accent. compared to modern accents, lincoln might be pegged somewhere between a kentucky and indiana accent.look up examples of these accents and pick up on the ways in which particular sounds are inflected. contrary to what you d think, many accounts state that lincoln had a soft, light voice,  like a bird .   actors have tried to replicate lincoln s way of speaking. look at a reading of lincoln s speech and get a hang for the way an actor will inflect his voice.  although no recordings of lincoln s speech exist, historians have done research and concluded that lincoln s voice was considerably higher pitched than the usual baritone we hear from politicians.his voice was however not shrill or silly sounding. if you have a naturally deep voice, try to sound a bit higher than you normally would.   edison s first recordings of human speech occurred 12 years after lincoln s death. this makes it anyone s guess what he really sounded like.  steven spielberg s 2012 lincoln biopic has been acclaimed for its historical accuracy.in particular, a lot of attention has been given to how true daniel day lewis  performance is to everything we know of the man. if you want to get lincoln s inflections and personality down, you should watch the film and try to emulate the actor on screen. take care to note the way lincoln talks, as well as the manner in which he moves.   if you were still stumped on certain aspects of your costume you should look at the way the film s costume crew approached lincoln s look.  
query	124	 tall varieties of sunflowers require lots of sun and a sheltered position. tall flower heads can bend over in moderate winds, which can cause their stems to break.    you can also use

about waist height, you might want to give the plant some support using a tall, sturdy garden stake or cane. drive this into the ground fairly deeply and then loosely tie the sunflower stalk to the cane.   you may want to tie the plant in another place further up the stem as it grows.    remember to give your sunflower some water during dry periods. make sure not to over water your plant because sunflowers do not generally like having soggy feet.    slugs and snails may attack the young plants so you might consider covering them with a clear plastic bottle with the funnel end cut off to make a homemade cloche. remember to remove this once the plant starts to outgrow it.   alternately, consider using pellets or traps.    sunflowers are hungry plants. you can really help the plant s growth by giving it a weekly feed with a liquid fertilizer. avoid using slow release or granular fertilizers as these will release nutrients too slowly to benefit the fast growing plant.   you may find that

german naval  enigma  code machines is generally agreed to have helped shorten the conflict by several years.  to mark the centenary of turing s birth in 2012, a mass participation science project was proposed by the university of manchester, where turing studied. individuals, groups and schools were encouraged to plant sunflowers to help prove turing s theories about the presence of fibonacci numbers in sunflowers. this would also help commemorate this brilliant scientist as well as prove his work in a 2012 experiment examining 3000 sunflower heads.   turing s sunflowers aren t a special variety. for the science experiment it was proposed that taller varieties were used. these include sunflowers varieties such as russian giant, giant single and giant yellow. all these varieties grow

query	130	 attack the ball at the highest point possible. jump and meet the ball as high as you can in its arc off the rebound. the higher you jump, the better your chances of snatching the ball ahead of someone else.pay attention to your peripheral vision as you snag the ball. note the positions of players around the side court line. these players will be the  outlet  you pass to.    it can be difficult to coordinate all this movement in such a short period of time, which is why practicing the outlet pass is so important. as soon as you ve secured the ball, but while you re still in the air, try to turn your head to look down court at possible targets for an outlet pass.  when making long outlet passes, aim for a spot on the court instead of a teammate. try to pass so that nearby offensive teammates can pick up the pass on their drive to the net, like the area between 3 point and free throw line.the area between the 3 point and free throw line allows enough space for the ball to bounce once before going out of bounds, giving more time for your offense to retrieve it.  this will prevent the opposing team s defense from slapping the ball out of your hands. once you secure the ball, draw it towards your body until it is under your chin.your elbows should be pointed out. you should still be in the air while performing this motion.  when you land, place your feet to form a wide base. allow your legs to bend slightly at the knees upon impact. the hardest part about landing is maintaining the under the chin position of the ball throughout the motion.landing in this fashion will minimize impact, which should help you keep the ball in position underneath your chin.    pivoting to the outside  away from the basket  will funnel your rebounded ball to safer territory. pivot as soon as you land in the direction of the outlet you scoped out earlier, then pass the ball.even a poor pass to an outlet can be recovered by your teammates. the heavier defense at your opponent s net should be avoided, if possible.  the number of passers and outlets does not have to be even. players more likely to outlet should mostly outlet, and the same goes for the passers. however, all players should try both positions at least a few times.players that have experience both as a passer and outlet will have a better understanding of the difficulties facing teammates in these positions, which can improve team cohesion.    passers should arrange themselves in a single line starting behind the free throw line. a single outlet should stand one or two steps from the sideline on both sides of the net. extra outlets can wait at center court.  as players execute receive outlet passes, they should rotate turns performing the exercise. after performing, players should not do it again until everyone else has a turn.    to set themselves up, passers should bounce a ball off the backboard. passers should then attack the ball, jumping to retrieve it at the highest point possible. when the ball is secured, passers should look down court for an outlet while drawing the ball beneath their chin.if there is a coach or a teammate directing this drill, have this person set up passers by bouncing the ball off the backboard for the passers. as the ball is secured, coaches and teammates should pay attention to the passer s form and execution. help your teammates improve with pointers and suggestions.  passers should flex their knees a little bit when they land. their elbows should be pointed off to each side and the ball should remain under their chin. a wide stance will provide the best stability. passers should pivot away from the basket towards the direction of the outlet.  after the pivot, the passer will pass the ball to the outlet.players should rejoin fellow passers and outlets and repeat the drill after everyone else has practiced it. continue in this fashion to drill outlet passing.  it may speed things up if there are two or three active balls. this way, while a ball is being passed, other players can be getting ready with spare balls to quickly execute their part in the drill.

query	135	 some orchids are easier to grow than others. cattleya, phalaenopsis and paphiopedilum orchids are amongst the easiest to grow and are recommended for most beginner gardeners and orchid growers. there are, however, believed to be over 20,000 species of orchid species   that s 2 times the amount of existing bird species and 4 times the amount of existing mammalian species. there s almost literally an orchid for any type of person.   perhaps the most common genera of orchids found for sale include phalaenopsis, dendrobium and oncidium. phalaenopsis is known as the  moth orchid  and is extremely popular among beginning growers  the genus dendrobium contains about 1,200 species of orchids and is the classic epiphyte of orchids  oncidiums are characterized by column wings and a callus at the lip of the flower. different genera of orchids have different ideal humidities, growing temperatures, watering schedules, and light requirements. talk with your local nursery or visit the local chapter of your orchid society to find out what makes your genus of orchid grow best.    some first time orchid growers make the mistake of assuming that orchids need to be potted in soil like other blooming flowers, choosing potting soil as a conduit. that would be a grave mistake. most orchid roots need far more air than potting soil would give them, and so benefit from a looser, more porous mix.many people use bark chips, sphagnum moss, coconut husks, charcoal, perlite, and even styrofoam pellets as potting mix, often in combination. experiment with porous, breathable mixes that you have on hand, or ask an expert for his or her special recipe.    for simplicity s sake, you can make two basic kinds of potting mixes that will work for most kinds of orchids.   make a fine potting mix, suitable for slipper orchids, most oncidiums, miltonias, and orchids with small roots that enjoy moisture more than most  4 parts fine  grain  fir bark or fine  grain  coco husk 1 part fine  grain  charcoal 1 part perlite   make a medium potting mix, suitable for cattleyas, phalaenopsis, and other mature orchids. if you re unsure of which mix to use, try the medium grade potting mix before the fine grade mix  4 parts medium  grain  fir bark or medium  grain  coco husk 1 part medium  grain  charcoal 1 part perlite      many orchids are comfortable being root bound. choose a smaller pot to place your orchid in, making sure that there are plenty of holes in the pot itself for drainage. remember, the enemy of orchids is often over watering. some orchids, such as cymbidiums, will require longer pots to accommodate very long root systems. the following types of pots offer a break from the traditional clay pot  which is perfectly acceptable     net pots, which have wire mesh and allow for a breathable environment. these can be hung in advantageous locations for better sunlight. clear plastic pots, which get better sunlight to the roots. these allow the grower to inspect the root systems without disturbing the orchid. wooden pots, which are constructed of rot resistant wood. line any wooden pots with sheet moss before adding your potting mixture.    make sure your hands and your environment are sterile. scatter just a few seeds immediately beneath the surface of each pot. add environmentally friendly fertilizer, if necessary. again, use the best soil available.    remove the orchid from its original pot, making sure to cut off any dead or rotting roots. divide the root matter into several different sections, if needed, before placing the plant in its pot.the most mature section of growth should be positioned against the wall of the pot. lightly add the potting mix, barely covering the root system.    different orchids benefit from being re potted accordingly    yearly  dendrobium, miltonia, paphiopedilum and phalaenopsis  and hybrids  bi annually  cattleya, dendrobium, oncidium, odontoglossum  and hybrids  once every three years  vanda, cymbidium    most orchids originate from a tropical climate, meaning good air, plenty of light, and 12 hour days  365 days a year . the temperature  depending on the species of orchid  should range between 65 to 75 degrees fahrenheit  18.3 to 23.8 degrees celsius .   make sure that there s about a 20 degree f  6.66 degree c  difference between day and night temperatures. this must be implemented as soon as you begin.    many orchids enjoy indirect sunlight  direct sunlight cases them to burn, while not enough creates a plant that doesn t flower.   check your orchid s leaves if you want to diagnose whether it s getting too much light or not enough. orchid leaves should be a light, even green if healthy. if the leaves are dark green, it means that the orchid isn t getting enough light. if the leaves are yellow, brown, or reddish, it means they re getting too much.low light orchids   paphiopedilum, phalaenopsis, and oncidium  do best if they get northerly or easterly light. moderate to high light orchids  cattleya, dendrobium, and vanda  prefer getting westerly or southerly light. orchids love being behind curtains or window blinds. this way, they get plenty of light, but the light that they do get is indirect.    during the summer months, longer days and more heat might necessitate a shorter watering period.   keep the following genera moist  although not soggy  at all times  paphiopedilum, miltonia, cymbidium, and odontoglossum. keep the following genera moist during active growth, but allow to dry in between waterings otherwise  cattleya, oncidium, brassia, and dendrobium. allow the following genera to dry out in between waterings  phalaenopsis, vanda, and ascocenda.    orchids require much more attention than your average plant or flower. the thicker your leaves are, the more likely your plant requires a larger dose of water. if your plant has bulky faux bulbs, less water is better. orchids are not resilient in most occasions, but are when it comes to their water intake. again, they actually deal with a lack of water better than a superfluous amount of water.    typically, expect to fertilize your orchid once a month, but rarely more. fertilize too often and you ll chance burning the roots and hampering flowering  fertilize not often enough and you ll chance hampering the flowering process.    because of orchids  natural affinity for humidity, keep the humidity of your growing room   wherever it may be   at about 60  to 80  at all times.    each strand of orchid has different caretaking needs and rules. no one orchid is the same  all require a different temperature, lighting situation and watering schedule. so when you choose an orchid plant to grow, you must be flexible when growing orchids.  
query	136	 another acceptable way to address the pope in writing would be  most holy father.    note, however, that on the envelope, you should address the pope as  his holiness,           with the pope s name in the blank. for instance, if writing to pope francis, the envelope would read,  his holiness, pope francis.     throughout the body of the letter, your tone should be polite and gracious. you do not need to write in flowery language, but your language should be on par with how you would speak or be expected to speak inside a catholic church.   avoid swearing, slang, derogatory language, or any other forms of impolite speech. write out everything you need or want to say, but keep in mind that the pope is a busy man. instead of dragging on and spending extensive space on flattery, it would be better for all parties concerned if you kept the formalities basic and went directly into the purpose of your letter.    as a roman catholic, you should conclude the letter with a sentence along the lines of,  i have the honor to profess myself with the most profound respect. your holiness  most obedient and humble servant,  before signing your name.if you are not a catholic, you can change the closing to something along the lines of,  with every good wish to your holiness, i am, sincerely yours,  followed by your signature. something as simple as  with every best wish. sincerely yours,  with a signature after it would also work for a non catholic writing to the pope. regardless of the exact wording you choose, the level of respect you demonstrate should correspond to the minimum level of respect you should have for someone in the pope s position, at the very least. someone who does not follow catholic teaching or who disagrees with the pope should still recognize his position of authority and close in a respectful manner. anyone who does follow catholic teaching should demonstrate the respect expected from one addressing the leader of his or her faith on earth.    if you plan to send your letter by traditional mail, you should write the address on the envelop as  his holiness, pope francis   apostolic palace   00120 vatican city.   note that you should separate the address onto separate lines according to the placements of the slashes,  . other ways to write the same address include   his holiness, pope francis pp.   00120 via del pellegrino   citta del vaticano his holiness pope francis   apostolic palace   vatican city his holiness pope francis   vatican city state, 00120   do not write  italy  on the envelop as the country. the vatican is considered its own independent nation, completely separate from italy.    if you would rather send the letter by e mail or fax, you must go through the vatican press office. the pope does not have a personal, public e mail address or fax number.   the e mail address is  av pccs.vathe fax number is   390669885373 note that neither form of contact goes directly to the pope, but correspondence you have for the pope will get to him eventually when sent through either of these means.     his holiness  and  holy father  both address the pope by his title and position in the church. you should address the pope only by these titles rather than by his name when speaking to him face to face.    the amount of applause will vary depending on the venue, but you should always stand in respect once the pope walks into the room you are in.usually, if the venue is a small room with a small to mid size crowd, the applause is quiet and polite. for large venues, however, like a stadium mass, loud applause and even cheers are appropriate.    if the pope approaches you directly, you should kneel with your right knee bent to the floor.   you do not need to make the sign of the cross, as you would do while genuflecting to the eucharist, but you should still bend at the knee. genuflection is a sign of high respect.    if you are catholic and if the pope offers you his hand, that would be an appropriate time to plant a quick yet respectful kiss on the piscatory ring, also known as the ring of the fisherman, traditionally worn by the pope.   on the other hand, if the pope offers you his hand and you are not catholic, you are not obligated to kiss the ring. you could simply shake his hand, instead. the ring of the fisherman is a symbol and mark of the office. by kissing it, you show both respect and sincere affection for the man who holds that office.    plan what to say beforehand so that you do not stumble too much over your words, and maintain a tone that is both clear and respectful the entire time.   start by introducing yourself. give your name and say something important or fitting about yourself. if you came to the vatican for a specific purpose or desired an audience with the pope for a specific purpose, you should also state that. the pope will guide the conversation, and you should let him do so. keep your answers direct and brief, and speak in a clear, loud voice so that the pope can hear you.    as soon as the pope stands to leave, you should stand, as well. wait until he leaves the room before you sit down again or pay attention to anything else.   applause is not usually necessary at the end of the audience or event, but if you are in a large crowd and the crowd begins to applaud, it is appropriate to join in if you so desire.

query	137	 prince charming is meant to be an ideal to aspire to, but are you spending too much time focusing on this ideal above real people  spend some time thinking about what you mean when you think of prince charming. ask yourself what qualities he has and why you think this ideal man is so important.if you realize that your ideal man bears a strong resemblance to a fictional character, it might be a good idea to take a break from watching or reading about him.    it s good to have expectations  they can protect you from being hurt or unhappy in a relationship. however, if your expectations for a future partner are extremely detailed or don t bear any resemblance to any person you ve ever met, you might be holding out for an unrealistic ideal.  it s okay to have some things you won t compromise on, but your non negotiables should be major characteristics. holding out for a guy who has a job or has physical chemistry with you is fine. things like hobbies, eye color, or fashion sense should not determine whether or not someone is truly meant for you.  once you have a set of non negotiables, compromise on the rest  plenty of people find true love with someone who is shorter than they expected or who doesn t like the same video games they do. work on imagining yourself with someone who doesn t satisfy every criteria on your list.  some people hide behind fantasies of an ideal partner because they lack confidence. if this describes you, spend some time working on your self confidence.   list your favorite things about yourself. if you need help, ask a friend or relative  they know lots of great things about you. exercise and eat fresh foods. you don t have to change your body to feel confident, but moving around and avoiding processed foods can make you feel good about your life choices. do something you re good at. excelling at something can raise your confidence.    spending all your time waiting for your perfect man can scare off potential partners. a good way to stop pining for prince charming is to get into a new hobby. try something that requires you to meet other people, like a local sports league or online gaming.    new interests are a great start to getting out of your comfort zone, but it s important to practice this skill whenever possible. try things wearing brighter colors, visiting a new store, or ordering new foods every day. when you re thinking about how to challenge yourself, you aren t thinking about prince charming  and you might be putting yourself in a position to meet someone great for you   don t pin your hopes for the future on a handsome man rescuing you from all your problems. if you don t have any plans for your life beyond meeting the perfect man, you are actually making it harder to find someone. very few people want to be with someone who has no interests or ambitions outside of romance. think seriously about your career, financial, and educational goals, and work towards them as much as you can.  don t sit around waiting for your perfect man to introduce himself. if you see someone who looks interesting, walk up to them and start talking  it s best to keep it observational at first  talk about the weather, the music playing, or compliment their clothing.    if you re holding out for prince charming, it can be hard to resist ignoring everybody who doesn t fit your list. try your best not to do this  when you look at prospective dates, think about what they do have to offer instead of all the ways they don t meet your requirements.  when you re meeting someone new, focus on whether or not they have chemistry with you. do you feel excited to talk to them  are you interested in hearing what they have to say  would you be sad if you never saw them again  these questions are much more important than figuring out whether or not they are just like your prince charming.  if someone asks you out and they aren t your ideal partner, you shouldn t necessarily reject them immediately. if you have a rapport with them or enjoy being around them, give them a chance this doesn t mean you should go out with anyone who asks. if you don t like someone, you shouldn t date them.  
query	138	 you may have an editor assigning your topic, or you may be a freelancer choosing your own. regardless, be familiar with the most common forms of sports articles and determine which best matches your task. there are five types with which to be most familiar a  straight lede   or  lead   is a basic recap of a sporting event, providing the essentials on who played, who did what, and who won. they can be  but need not be  so formulaic that a computer can write them,and are most common today for youth level, high school, and small college events that are not shown or covered on tv radio internet. a  feature lede lead  is more common for larger college and professional events where most of the readership already knows the score, but wants a more in depth view of what happened and who made the difference in the result. a  profile  focuses on a colorful character or key figure such as a coach, star quarterback, or journeyman backup catcher with a love for practical jokes. a  season preview or wrap up  either prepares the reader for the season to come or takes them on a tour of the highs and lows of the just completed season. for instance, a baseball writer might file a preview during spring training and a best worst summary after the end of the regular season  or playoffs . a  column  is an opinion piece where the sportswriter gets to express his her opinions on  mostly  sports  mostly  freely. aspiring sportswriters are likely to have fewer opportunities to write opinion columns than old pros who have proven their mettle over the years.    leaf through your local newspaper, favorite sports magazine, or go to sports website and think about what makes certain articles stand out. how does the writer draw you in and make you feel like you were at the big game or in the locker room    search websites for classic and modern examples of exceptional sports writing.  sports fans are known for their passion and not necessarily for their patience.if you don t know a sand wedge from a 5 iron or mention your admiration for  laron james   passing skills, readers who know, love, and may have experience playing the sport covered will probably tune you out quickly.   when you re starting out, if you have the choice, cover the sport you know best. master writing effectively about it before moving on to less familiar sports.    what would you want to know about this sporting event  is the reader likely to already know the final score and who was the star of the game, or are you breaking the news  write an article you would want to read as a fan of that sport.    watch closely. take notes. keep track of important plays, scores, and statistics. take note of interesting details, such as how the players celebrated at the end or the feel of the crowd that night.   local sporting events are a good place to start for an aspiring sportswriter. you ll find passionate fans parents, eager participants, and a good environment for covering a sporting event from several angles.    even if you are writing an event recap and not a personal interest story, a few good soundbites or a central figure to build the article around can only help.   contact coaches to see if they have a player who would make a good story. watch the subject play the game, and set up a brief interview. figure out what makes his or her story distinctive. talk to players and coaches to get quotes about the game. even asking boilerplate questions like  what contributed to you winning the game   will give you some material with which to work. ask permission to record your interviews. also, try talking to people close to the person, such as parents and friends to create a well rounded view of the person.    obviously you need to provide the final score and who did the scoring, but think about the most interesting statistics to come out of the event. how many passing yards did the quarterback have  did the team s star swimmer set a personal best in the backstroke  was a long losing or winning streak broken     known in journalistic circles as a lead  or lede , the opening lines of an article, sports focused or otherwise, are critical to the success of the piece.leads should be short, direct, provide the most essential information, and compel the reader to keep going deeper into the article.   leads focus on the 5  w s  and  h   who, what, when, where, why, and how . in a sports context, the score is always a great place to start. for example   last night in falcon park, the air as crisp as winning quarterback joe smith s passes, the redview falcons stunned the first place washington coyotes in overtime, 56 to 54.     what was the best part of the game  what were the highlights  what made this game special  for a person, why is his or her story important  what makes them special  use the quotes you got from players and coaches to add interest to the story.   consider the 4 step approach to a sports recap that begins with the lead, follows with more essential information, then adds a quote for flavor, then pushes out the rest of the details.news article writing relies on an  inverted pyramid  structure, where the most substantial elements are found at the top of the article, and the information becomes less weighty and important as one approaches the bottom.readers always start but don t always finish an article, so make sure they get your best stuff up front.    even if you aren t on an editor s word count, one of the essential goals of all journalism, including sports writing, is to say as much as possible in as few words as possible. even if you aren t restrained by the space needs of a newspaper and are publishing online, your readers will appreciate it if you get to the point quickly. use shorter sentences instead of longer ones.    if you re assigned a profile piece, conduct an in depth interview and humanize the subject for your readers. if given the chance to write an opinion column, be bold and invite a reaction response from readers. as mentioned in method one, know what type of sports article you are writing and study best practices for success.    writing is work, often very hard work. try to remember why you wanted to write about sports in the first place. think about what you love about sports and let it be reflected in your writing.   if you are covering your alma mater in a basketball game or interviewing a pro golfer who happens to be a childhood hero, let your fan dom be revealed. sports are about passion, enthusiasm, and often silly biases. be impartial with the facts but let readers see you as a sports fan as well as sports writer.    most readers of sports articles have, at some point, dreamed of being at the plate with the world series on the line or serving for the u.s. open title. even if they never reached that point, they probably remember what it s like to grip the bat or toe the service line nervously. find creative ways to make them feel like they were there at the event you re covering, not just in the crowd, but on the field.   for example, draw from interviews to place the reader at the foul line with the game on the line   as she looked at the basket, trying desperately to block out the crowd behind it and the emptiness in front, jane davis could swear she caught a glimpse of her old garage wall holding up the hoop, felt the crumbling driveway beneath her feet, and sensed her dad at her side.     sports writing can sometimes get a bad rap as a lesser form of journalism, but some of the best writers and writing today and historically have covered sports. hemingway famously wrote about bullfighting, and more recently, one of novelist david foster wallace s most remembered pieces was about tennis star roger federer. don t sell yourself or your readers short, even if you are covering a youth soccer game. those kids are giving their best, and so should you.  
query	139	 make a list of all the letters found in the first name, then make a separate list of all the letters found in the second name. put the lists side by side but keep them both separate and distinct from one another.   this method is a good way to mix the names of two parents when choosing a baby name, but you can technically use this method with any two names. you can even use this method when you have more than two names to mix. you can write out the letters in the order they appear within each name, or you can rearrange the letters alphabetically. the latter may help you view the letters as separate letters instead of a name.  example  consider the names  william  and  sarah.   the former name uses the letters  a, i, i, l, l, m, w.  the latter name uses the letters  a, a, h, r, s.       treat your two name lists like an unscramble puzzle or a game of boggle. pull letters from both lists to create a name. continue until you have formed as many different names as possible.you do not need to use all of the letters in both names. in fact, you will be able to create far more combinations if you only use a few letters. it may help to have a book of baby names nearby as you do this. there are many names you may not think of when doing this exercise on your own.  example  using the letters from  william  and  sarah,  you could form  alisa, iris, isaiah, larisa, lars, lisa, liam, maria, mariah, miriam, wallis, wilma    you may not spot every name possible the first time you run through your two lists. it is a good idea to return to your lists multiple times to see if you can find any new names hidden inside.   consider asking other people for help, too. someone else might be able to spot a combination you hadn t noticed yet. if you struggle to form names from your lists, you can also search online for  free name mixers.  when you find a result you like, input both names into the mixer and allow the website to generate a list of possible names from those two original names.example  upon further inspection, you could also use  william  and  sarah  to form  silas, shaw, rai, mars, lia, ash    break the first name you wish to use into its separate syllables. repeat with the second name you wish to use. write out the syllable sets side by side, but make sure you know which syllable sets came from which name.   this is another method commonly used to form baby names from the names of both parents, but it can be used with any two names. it works best with names that are two or more syllables long, however.  example  consider the names  christopher  and  elizabeth.    christopher  can be separated into the syllables  chris,   to,  and  pher.   elizabeth  can be separated into  e,   liz,   a,  and  beth.       grab a syllable set from the first name and a syllable set from the second name. put both sets together to form a new, unique name. repeat with the remaining syllable sets until you have formed every combination you could think of.   note that the names you come up with using this method will be unique, and most probably won t be found in any baby book. you can form combinations using one syllable set from both names, creating a new name that is two syllables long, or you can use multiple syllable sets from both names to create a longer combination.  example  using the syllables found in  christopher  and  elizabeth,  some of the possible combinations you might come up with could include  chrisabeth, christobeth, eliztopher, liztopher, elizapher, lizapher, bethtopher, bethapher, eto, toapher    some of the possible names you come up with might be better than others. comb through your list, removing any combinations that don t sound right and retaining the best options for further consideration.   while most of the names you will likely come up with won t be found in any baby books, it can still be a good idea to double check and make sure. if any of the names you do create already exist, they may have a meaning you will or won t like. repeat the name aloud several times to check how it rolls off the tongue. names that sound clunky or hard to pronounce should be eliminated, as should any possible name you simply don t like. consider showing your list of possible names to other people, too. ask them to pronounce each name on the list. if other people routinely struggle with the pronunciation of one name, you may want to consider eliminating that name.  example  if people struggle over the name  toapher,  for instance, you might want to strike that one off your list.    you can use any two names, but short names tend to work best for this method.   this method is most commonly used for names other than the given names of both parents. use this method once you narrow down your selection to two names. if you attempt to use more than two names, the result will usually seem unreasonably long and clunky. additionally, this method works best when you narrow it down to names from one gender. it isn t as easy to use when combining names from both genders.  example  if the child will be a girl, the father of the baby might like  sarah  and the mother of the baby might like  elizabeth.   if the child will be a boy, the father might like  samuel  and the mother might like  luke.       put both names side by side, then separate them with a hyphen. doing so should give you a new, mixed name.combine the names in both orders to see which order sounds best.  example  for  sarah  and  elizabeth,  the two options would be  sarah elizabeth  and  elizabeth sarah.   for  samuel  and  luke,  the two options would be  samuel luke  and  luke samuel.       if one or both names seem too long, consider using the shortened form of the name instead of the full name. after shortening the names, hyphenate them again in the same manner as before.   you can combine a shortened version of one name with the full version of the second name, or you can shorten both names  when applicable  and use both shortened versions instead.  example  for  sarah  and  elizabeth,  the name  elizabeth  can be shortened to  beth,  giving you the new option of  sarah beth.  in this case, you can even remove the hyphen and the  h  after  sarah,  leaving you with  sarabeth.   for  samuel  and  luke,  the name  samuel  can be shortened to  sam,  giving you the options  sam luke  and  luke sam.     
query	140	 it can be very overwhelming and difficult for parents to understand exactly what their baby is at risk of. the staff is aware of this and generally will explain things to you in a way that you will understand if you continue to have questions and concerns.    strange machines, special lighting, monitors and tubes attached to your baby can be frightening. ask the staff to explain to you what each item is used for and why your baby requires it.    your baby may be monitored by several different specialists. the neonatologist has been trained in the care of premature babies. your baby may require a respiratory specialist, an optometrist for the care of his eyes or a cardiologist to care for his heart. become familiar with each care giver and the services they provide.    if your baby is unable to suckle at this point, question what your course of action regarding nursing in the future should be. it may be possible to pump your breast milk and have it offered to the baby by other means. the staff will be able to advise you.    hospitals rules and procedures may vary so you will need to become familiar with the way your babies nicu works and the guidelines you are expected to follow while your baby is a patient there.    the high tech equipment can be scary at first glance but when you come to realize what everything does and why your baby needs it, you can learn to relax a bit as you grow accustomed to the new environment that you have been thrown into.    touch your baby as often as you can. stroke his face or rub his head, any type of contact is encouraged to help form a bond with your baby and help improve his condition.    your voice is important to baby and may offer comfort. whisper and hum to him or sing softly.    often the staff will encourage this and will assist you with diaper changing by detaching equipment when necessary.   nan  it may be unsettling to hold your baby with all the wires attached to him but keep in mind that if the staff believed it was a danger to your baby they would not allow you to hold him. generally, the staff will bring a chair close enough to where your baby is monitored that you can safely sit and hold your baby.    this is another instance in which the staff will gladly assist you to help you care for your baby.    this is a technique in which the diapered baby is placed inside mom s shirt to offer skin to skin contact between mom and baby. your baby will be closer to your heart beat and the heat of your body. this is another good technique to enhance the bonding experience between mom and baby.    a soft blanket, a stuffed toy, or a picture of family members helps to brighten and personalize the area.    it is easy to forget your needs under stressful circumstances such as this. baby needs you to remain strong and healthy to help him do well.    be sure to stay well hydrated.    this is a trying time so it is no wonder that you can quickly go from feeling joy and wonder to feeling anger, fear or frustration.    allow someone to step in for you temporarily while you take some time to recoup.    cooking, cleaning, child care and errands are tasks that can easily be performed by family and friends.    speak with other parents of nicu babies or join a support group for parents of preemies.    not only will it be beneficial for your baby if the need for it arises, it will assist in helping you to feel more confident in the care of your baby once you leave the hospital and bring your baby home.    your baby has been under the care of professionals long enough for you to feel secure in his care while in the nicu. removing your baby from his safe haven can create a bit of uncertainty and fear for parents.    perhaps a follow up home visit can be arranged to help you adjust.    if your baby appears to be in any form of distress once released from the nicu, contact your doctor immediately for further instructions or take your baby to a hospital emergency room.  
query	141	 tinnitus can range from very loud to very soft sounds, can be loud enough to interfere with normal hearing and be heard in one or both ears.you may hear ringing, buzzing, roaring, clicking or hissing sounds., there are essentially two types of tinnitus  subjective and objective tinnitus.   subjective tinnitus is the most common form of tinnitus. it can be caused by structural ear problems  in the outer, middle and inner ear  or by problems with the auditory nerve pathways leading from the inner ear to the brain. in subjective tinnitus, you are the only person hearing the sound. objective tinnitus is much rarer, but can be perceived by a physician during an examination. this can be caused by vascular problems, muscle contractions or conditions related to the inner ear bone.    tinnitus tends to affect men more often than women. older people tend to experience tinnitus more than young people. some of the key risk factors for tinnitus include  age  the peak age of first experiencing tinnitus is between 60 and 69 years  gender military service  exposure to loud explosions, gunfire, loud machinery  employment in a loud workplace environment listening to loud music those exposed to any loud noise, either through work or through leisure activities a history of depression, anxiety and or obsessive compulsive disorder.    the tinnitus handicap inventory, a questionnaire from the american tinnitus association may be a good place to start. this questionnaire asks you to assess your level of auditory problems so that you can determine the extent to which tinnitus affects you. this can be a good first step in figuring out how to treat your tinnitus.    the doctor will likely physically examine your ears with an otoscope  a lighted instrument for inspecting ears . you may also undergo a hearing test, potentially some imaging tests such as an mri or a ct scan. in some cases, more extensive tests may be necessary. in general, these tests are not invasive or painful, but may cause some discomfort. you may experience changes in the bones of the inner ear that can be genetically based. the inner ear includes three very small bones  the malleus, the incus and the stapes. these three bones are connected to each other and to the eardrum  tympanic membrane . they are also connected to the structures that translate sound vibrations into nerve impulses that we perceive as sound. if these bones are not able to move freely because of otosclerosis, tinnitus can result. you may also have excessive earwax, which can cause tinnitus.    unfortunately, many times the exact cause of tinnitus cannot be determined. many times, it may simply be due to aging, such as the following conditions age related hearing loss  presbycusis  menopause  tinnitus is one of the rarer symptoms of menopause and it may be actually due to age rather than the menopausal transition. often, the tinnitus disappears along with other menopausal issues. hormone replacement therapy with synthetic progestins has been associated with increased tinnitus.  if you work in a constantly loud environment, or you have been exposed to loud noises, be sure to mention this to your doctor. this will help him diagnose your condition.    many disorders that impact blood flow can cause tinnitus. talk to your doctor about the following disorders    head and neck tumors that press on blood vessels and change the blood flow atherosclerosis or the build up of cholesterol containing plaques on the insides of arteries high blood pressure anatomical variations in the carotid artery in the neck that can cause turbulence in blood flow malformed capillaries  arteriovenous malformation     many medications can cause or exacerbate tinnitus. some of these medications can include    aspirin antibiotics, such as polymyxin b, erythromycin, vancomycin and neomycin diuretics  water pills , including bumetanide, ethacrynic acid and furosemide quinine some anti depressants chemotherapeutics, including mechlorethamine and vincristine    tinnitus can be caused by many different conditions, so be sure to get your doctor s opinion on whether you have any of the

refer you to a specialist such as an ear, nose and throat specialist  ent specialist or otolaryngologist . tinnitus can cause other problems, including fatigue, stress, insomnia, difficulties with concentrating and with memory, depression and irritability. if you are experiencing any of these, make sure to mention these to the doctor.    treatment for tinnitus will depend to a large extent on the discovery of an underlying cause, but may include the following earwax removal. treating underlying conditions  examples of this might include treating high blood pressure or atherosclerosis. changing medications  if your tinnitus is due to a reaction to a specific medication, your doctor may change the medication or change the dose. try medications specifically for tinnitus  while there is no specific drug to treat tinnitus, some medications have been used with some success. these include antidepressants and antianxiety drugs. these, however, are also associated with a number of side effects including dry mouth, blurry vision, constipation, heart problems, drowsiness and nausea.    hearing aids may be useful for some people. your physician might recommend a hearing aid after you have been examined by a licensed audiologist.according to the american tinnitus association,  hearing loss causes less external sound stimuli to reach the brain. in response, the brain undergoes neuroplastic changes in how it processes different sound frequencies. tinnitus is the product of these maladaptive neuroplastic changes. essentially, this means that with progressive hearing loss, the brain tries to adapt. but sometimes, that adaptation doesn t work and tinnitus is the result. in general, the hearing loss is often at and above the frequency of the tinnitus itself.  mask the noise in your ears by turning on background music or other sounds.you can use tapes or cds with  white noise  of the ocean, a babbling brook, rainfall, soft music or whatever works to help block out and cover up the sounds in your ears.    white noise or other soothing sounds can also be used to help you sleep. this can be important, as many people find it difficult to sleep with tinnitus. at night, the sound in your ears can become the only sound audible and can make it hard to fall asleep. background noise can serve to provide a peaceful sound to help you sleep.     brown noise  is a collection of randomly generated sounds and is generally perceived as much deeper sounds than white noise. pink noise  uses lower frequencies and is also perceived as deeper sounds than white noise. either pink or brown noise is often recommended to help with sleep.find examples online of both pink and brown noise. choose the noise that sounds best to you.    one of the most common triggers for tinnitus is the presence of loud noises.avoid these as much as possible. some people may not be affected by loud noises. but if you do experience worsening or aggravated tinnitus after hearing loud noises, you ll know that this may be a trigger for you.    a german study involving music therapy in tinnitus showed that music therapy employed in early cases of tinnitus can prevent that tinnitus turns into a chronic condition.this therapy involves listening to your favorite music with its frequency altered to center on the same frequency as the ringing in your ears.  temporomandibular joint  tmj  problems, which can cause tinnitus, can be successfully treated with chiropractic approaches,, tmj problems are thought to promote tinnitus because of the proximity of muscles and ligaments that attach to the jaw and the hearing bones. a chiropractic treatment would consist of manual manipulation in order to re align the tmj. the chiropractor might also manipulate the vertebrae of the neck in order to decrease the symptoms of tinnitus. chiropractic adjustments are not painful, but they may cause some temporary discomfort. the chiropractic treatment may also include the application of heat or ice and specific exercises.chiropractic treatments can also help with meniere s disease, another relatively rarer cause of tinnitus.  a recent review of studies of the success of acupuncture for tinnitus concluded that there was some cause for hope. acupuncture techniques would vary based on the underlying cause for the tinnitus. these techniques also often include traditional chinese herbs.more studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture on improving tinnitus.    aldosterone is a hormone found in the adrenal gland that regulates sodium and potassium in the blood.one study found a tinnitus patient with hearing loss to have an aldosterone deficiency. when the patient received bioidentical aldosterone, the patient s hearing was restored and the tinnitus went away.   there is a relatively new approach that may be useful for some. the idea is to find the frequency of the particular sound in your ears and masking that specific frequency with specially designed sounds.   your ent or audiologist may have recommendations about these treatments. you may also find these treatments available online for a fee through websites such as audionotch and tinnitracks. these services walk you through testing for the specific frequency of your tinnitus and design a treatment protocol. there have been limited studies on this approach, but they do appear promising.   your body uses coq10, or coenzyme q10, for cell growth and maintenance. it is also an antioxidant. coq10 can also be found in organ meats, such as heart, liver and kidney.one study indicated that coq10 supplements could be helpful for some patients with a low serum level of coq10. try taking 100 mg three times a day.  ginkgo biloba is believed to increase blood flow to the brain and has been used to treat tinnitus with variable results. this is likely because tinnitus has many known and unknown causes.   a recent review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the use of ginkgo biloba to treat tinnitus.another recent report, on the other hand, concluded that a standardized extract of ginkgo, egb 761, was an effective treatment.egb 761 is a  standardised extract of ginkgo biloba leaves and has antioxidant properties as a free radical scavenger. a standardised extract of ginkgo biloba leaves is a well defined product and contains approximately 24  flavone glycosides  primarily quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin  and 6  terpene lactones  2.8 3.4  ginkgolides a, b and c, and 2.6 3.2  bilobalide .  commercially, this particular supplement is sold as tebonin egb 761. follow manufacturer s instructions if taking this supplement.    in one study, almost half of tinnitus patients improved with 50 milligrams  mg  of zinc daily for 2 months. this is actually a rather high dose of zinc. the recommended daily intake of adult males is 11 mg and for females, the recommended dose is 8 mg.   don t take this amount of zinc without talking to a knowledgeable healthcare professional first. if you do take this high amount of zinc, don t take it longer than 2 months. balance your intake of zinc with copper supplements. a high intake of zinc is associated with copper deficiency and copper deficiency anemias and taking the extra copper will help prevent that.take 2 mg of copper every day.    melatonin is a hormone that is involved in the sleep cycle. one study indicated that 3 mg of melatonin taken at night was most effective in men without a history of depression and those with tinnitus in both ears.  it is generally recommended to avoid salty foods because of their association with high blood pressure, which can cause tinnitus.   a reasonable recommendation is to eat a healthy, whole foods diet low in added salt, sugar and saturated fats and to increase the amounts of fruit and vegetables in the diet.  some of the most common triggers for tinnitus include coffee, alcohol, and nicotine.avoid any and all of these as much as possible. we don t really know why these are triggers for different people. because tinnitus is a symptom of a number of different possible problems, the reason these are triggers may vary on an individual basis.   cutting out these substances may not improve your tinnitus. in fact, one study showed that caffeine was not associated with tinnitus at all. another study indicated that alcohol may actually help relieve tinnitus in older adults. at a minimum, watch what happens if you have any coffee, alcohol or nicotine, especially being aware of what happens to your tinnitus after you indulge in any of these. if the tinnitus gets worse or harder to deal with, you may want to consider avoiding those triggers completely.    cognitive behavioral therapy  cbt  is an approach that uses techniques such as cognitive restructuring and relaxation to change a person s response to tinnitus. tinnitus retraining therapy is a complementary practice that helps desensitize you to the noise in your ears.   the therapist will teach you different ways to cope with the noise. this is a process in cbt known as habituation, where you can learn to ignore the tinnitus.the therapist will teach you about your tinnitus and will teach you a variety of relaxation techniques. this person will help you adopt a realistic, effective attitude in dealing with tinnitus. a recent review of the technique indicated that it didn t affect the level of noise, but it positively affected how the individual responded to the noise. the response after cbt included less depression and anxiety, with higher reported levels of satisfaction with life.a recent large review of therapeutic approaches to tinnitus determined that a combination of sound therapy  background noise  plus cbt provided the best overall results.another study reviewed nine high quality studies evaluating the efficacy of tinnitus retraining therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. in each study, a variety of standardized and validated questionnaires was used. the investigators found that both tinnitus retraining therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy were equally effective in relieving the symptoms of tinnitus.   you might find it useful to find a tinnitus support group, especially if you are experiencing depression or anxiety associated with the tinnitus.   this support group can help you develop tools to cope with your condition.    anxiety and depression can be associated with tinnitus and vice versa. if you are experiencing these symptoms, make sure you seek out professional help. usually, depression and anxiety exist before the tinnitus, but these conditions can follow the onset of tinnitus.the sooner you get treatment for tinnitus, anxiety and or depression, the sooner you can begin to feel and function better.tinnitus can also make concentrating difficult. this is where cognitive behavioral therapy can be very useful, providing different tools and resources to cope.

query	148	 different drums are available for beginner players and for more advanced drummers.   a beginner bongo is smaller and does not weigh as much as drums made for more skilled players. a bongo for an advanced drummer is typically more expensive due to better quality heads and rims and more ornate design.    the difference between the 2 materials is the tone of the sound of the drum. when it is played, a fiberglass drum offers a bright pop, while a wooden drum sends out an earthly, hollow sound.      when deciding on a rawhide skin to purchase, hold it up to the light. look for an evenly colored skin, which indicates a skin of uniform thickness. color variations can suggest the skin is not the same thickness all the way across, which affects the sound quality of the particular skin. since weather affects rawhide heads, expect changes in tone as the weather changes, and plan on spending more time tuning the head. warmer weather tightens the head and produces a higher pitch. synthetic heads are mass produced of man made materials and provide a consistent and smooth playing surface. changes in weather do not affect synthetic heads. synthetic heads offer a convenience above rawhide heads in that they come already stretched and tucked onto a frame and are ready to mount to the drum and play.      synthetic heads are typically pre fitted. pre fitted heads are convenient to replace quickly. they are not affected by humidity, altering the tuning and sound of the head, as rawhide heads are. flat heads give you the decision power of the exact rawhide you want for your drum and the satisfaction of tucking it on your own. if you use flat heads, you will have to learn how to tuck heads, and then each time you tuck one, you will have to wait to play the bongo until the head dries.      the size of the drummer can direct you to the size of bongo you purchase. a smaller drum set better accommodating a person of smaller stature. sound preference can be instrumental in determining the size of your bongos. smaller drums offer a higher pitched sound, while the sound of drums with larger heads is deeper.

query	154	 greece as an empire was active some time before the roman empire starting around 800bce and continued until the romans conquered it.   before 800bce is a period often referred to as the greek dark ages and the subsequent era is often called the archaic era. this was where the great cities, philosophies and sciences, theatre, classical art, law and the greek language being written down were starting to set seed. this era had many rulers known as tyrants   a word we still use today   whose gradual overthrow paved the way towards greek democracy and the athenian model of government. this era artistically had influences from egypt and what we call today as the middle east and is often called the orientalization of greece. after the last tyrant overthrow in 510 bce, this heralded the start of the classical period that is perhaps the most famous. its bedrock moment arrived because of the athenians successfully defending greece from a persian invasion and this period continues to the hellenistic civilisation starting in 323bce. this era is where the empire becomes dominant with alexander the great rising to power and expanding the empire through to india where he eventually turned back. this era ends with his death in 323bce, which leads to the hellenistic era. the hellenistic era focuses more on maintaining the empire but ends in 146bce when the divided greek empire falls under roman conquest and becomes part of the roman empire.    ancient greece had a clear social structure but was more flexible in some areas.   greece in many ways was more democratic than its ancient neighbour rome as social status did not give additional rights. democracy itself is a greek word. there was four main social classes in athens, yet if one earned more money and chattels they themselves could climb the social ladder. education was an important factor for climbing the social ladder as most rights were awarded once the education was completed, but education was an expensive and private engagement with the family employing a tutor. only sparta seems to have had publicly funded and obligatory education. slavery was common in greece  however there were differences between greece and rome. the greeks generally treated slaves far better than the romans with beating and killing them as forbidden and many slaves were offered their freedom as an agreement to work better. the population of slaves however varies by accounts of being the majority of the populace, but it is still clear they were a significant part of the population and many held roles in public service. unlike the romans, slaves were not accorded the rights of citizen after freedom and they were part of their own social group known as a  metic . in sparta however, things were far harsher for slaves and a group of slaves from conquered armies were often killed in a rite of passage for spartans. serving in the army was often compulsory for men, as it was not only a way to maintain and defend the empire, but also to give skills in engineering and management.    before christianity became mainstream in 529 ad, greek religion was pantheistic and included worship of heroes as an important factor.   one of the central dynamics of the religion focused on the epic conflict between the gods on mt olympus and the titans. the gods   titans feature within the same creation myth but were divided between them and frequently at war. the gods and goddesses are biographical and personalised than roman gods and these deities and legends had a complex relationship between themselves and humans. the cult like worship of heroes such as heracles  also known as hercules , perseus, achilles and their stories was important to greek society as they served as role models and sources of national pride. the  anti hero  was also important, which is not the villain of the story, but are bland or non heroic characters that are least likely to be heroes but become or act heroically. indian and other religions were also known to the ancient greeks, with one king who is commonly referred to menander i soter  or melinda in the indo greek world , who had embraced buddhism and reigned around 150bce ruling a significant eastern part of the empire. this region had influenced greek architecture, which in turn strongly influenced the roman models, yet heading the other way, the influence spread as far as japan. the greeks also set great store in oracles and prophecies, such as the famous oracle of delphi. oracles would often fall into a trance and priests for those who had paid for the prophecy translated their expressions. after the roman conquest, many of the greek gods with synthesized were roman equivalents within rome, this functioned in a way so a roman citizen could worship in greece but the synthesis also boosted the power of the roman gods. most of the planets, excepting earth, mars, and venus were named after greek gods   goddesses, visit know the twelve olympians of greek mythology to get some more background information on the heroes of greece.    these two fields were often part of the same school, where today philosophy is a separate field and occasionally not seen as a science at all.   learn about some of the famous greek philosophers and scientists such as thales, socrates, plato, aristotle, epicures, pythagoras, zeno, euclid, archimedes and more. early philosophers were more interested in science rather than wisdom, but in the classical period, wisdom, ethics, good governance and other virtues became equally important. greece was often at war with various nations within greece  such as athens and sparta , but also outside of greece with the persian world and other nations so philosophy was an important science. the greek language has contributed much to our modern language as many of our modern names for sciences come from ancient greece. some examples are physics, philosophy, astronomy, geography, mathematics, and cartography. other interesting technologies and inventions include   cranes for lifting, road building, the antikythera   reckoned to be a complex astronomical calendar, calipers, astrolabes, lighthouses, showers, waterwheels and many more including steam and water powered machinery. visit for how to live like socrates, argue using the socratic method, do the philosophy of happiness  diogenes, epicurus    understand stoicism for more ideas and insights about greek philosophy.    the greeks loved music, dance, poetry and theatre with tragic and comedic plays as well as the epics such as the odyssey and the illiad, as well as stories of the battles between athens, troy, sparta and other nations which are classics still told today.   theatre really came into its own during the classical period, after much of athens was destroyed by persian invasions. this revival and rebuilding led a great re invention and revival of greek literature and the word thespian has its origins in greece. the greeks attended plays in vast audiences, as it was a major source of entertainment. masks were a key costume part of greek theatre and some even had brass instruments fitted to act as a megaphone to amplify actors voices. the famous duo of the two masks of comedy and tragedy as a symbol of the theatre has their roots in greek theatre. some of the most famous plays and playwrights were sophocles, who counted among his works the story of oedipus, aristophanes who had many comedies but who also wrote  the clouds  a fictional spoof based on socrates, which was later used to falsely implicate the philosopher as being immoral and consequently executed by drinking hemlock poison. music in classic greece traditionally was an expression of philosophy, as a metaphor of the harmonics of the universe with everything vibrating in harmony. it was also an expression of ethos, with certain pieces played at certain times according to their inherent qualities. later music became more of an entertainment. ancient greek music was arguably more varied than modern music as while we have tones and half tones, greek tones went to quarter and even finer subtleties to be able to make perfect balance. greek instruments include string, wind and percussion instruments, including pan pipes  named after the greek god pan , lyres and harps as well as a complex zither like instrument known as a kithara, drums, trumpets, conch shells and a hydraulic organ known as a hydraulis, these instruments later became absorbed into ancient roman music. visit write an epic poem to learn how to create your own epic adventure in the greek style     greece had essentially a mediterranean diet, but it was not entirely as varied or rich as the modern cuisine of greece. ancient greek cuisine was frugal and austere, a major influence was the city of sparta, which even today gives us the word spartan. the ancient greeks loved their wine and a frequent way for men to pass the time was in a symposium, which was basically an evening of a few men  apart from female courtesans and entertainers, women were typically forbidden from the event . the meal as it was would feature snacks such as nuts, grains and pulses as well as honey cakes to be able to prolong drinking. like the romans, great feasts were reserved more for religious grounds and the wealthy, but they were still more austere than later roman empire extravagances. bread was a staple ingredient, mostly made from wheat or barley that was ground into a paste or dried to a flour. leavened bread from yeast and other raising agents were used but later reserved for feast days only and bakery produced bread was expensive, so most food was produced from scratch in homes. vegetables typically featured vegetables such as cabbage, onions, garlic, pulses such as peas, chickpeas   garbanzo beans, and broad beans, as well as lentils. the poor often had their meals were including acorns, bitter vetch and wild herbs. fruits included figs, pomegranates, raisins and if available fresh grapes. olives were an important ingredient as the plant would survive the hot, dry climate and the infertile, alkali soils of the region. this provided olive oil as well as olives for pickling. beverages typically included water, which the greeks valued as a nutritious, life giving drink and like a wine expert today can characterise and even judge its source, so too could the water experts of the time. wine was a common beverage, typically cut with water as it was thought unmixed could be fatal or induce madness. milk was not commonly drunk, although it likely was due to the poor keeping qualities in the climate, as milk was reserved for cheese. meat was very important to the greek diet, as fresh produce was often hard to grow and did not travel well, if the poor had access to land, they would typically raise geese and chickens, but also hunted for game such as hare and game birds. sausages were consumed across the classes, but the cost of a piglet in the cities from a butcher was about the cost of 3 days wages. cooked and salted meats were more common as fresh meat often required a religious ceremony where the fat and bones were cremated to honour the gods. learn how to pickle olives, make greek bean soup and make greek whole grain olive bread for some ideas     greek clothing was typically home made and while in movies is often portrayed as an all white wardrobe, greek fabrics were often vibrantly coloured and patterned. no complete traditional costume has ever survived to modern times so much of what we know comes from artworks and mentions in ancient literature.   clothing was typically made of wool and linen, often imported from egypt and other countries in the greek empire. both men and women wore a costume known as a chiton, which was a large rectangular piece of fabric often from the shoulder height to the floor of the wearer. men often wore them to their knee height while women wore them to ankle length. excess fabric resembled as a loose tunic. it was pulled and secured with a belt or clasp, below the breast or waist of the wearer. the fabric was occasionally pleated to be more decorative. men and soldiers often owned and used a cloak made from wool that was about the size of a blanket and often served as bedding at the same time. it was usually hemmed with a border to protect it from fraying as well as adding a decorative edge. the himation was a winter garment worn both genders over their chitons although sometimes it was worn instead of a chiton. it was similar to in appearance, but not as large as a roman toga. women often wore veils and shawls, both because modesty was an important virtue, but also to protect them during travel and public events from the harsh sun and climate.    you can learn from online sources, documentaries, visiting museums as well as from history experts to gain an insight into an empire, culture and its people whose effects can still be felt today within the modern world.

sturdy rain proof tent. sleeping bag with liner and foam mattress. backpack, day pack and probably a duffel bag to keep in storage in hotels while on trek. a kerosene stove that can be cleaned easily, a leak proof fuel container, lightweight pots, pans and cutlery. favorite food items.    good food is essential part of the trekking and here good food does not refer to costly delicacies but wholesome and nutritious diet. choice of food is limited once you leave the town and head for wilderness. in many villages there are no food outlets and the trekkers have to be on their own for food. one should drink boiled water or tea mostly to avoid dehydration. however freshly cooked food has no substitute as tinned food losses its taste after some time. trekkers should carry dry fruits, chocolates, sweets, soup packets, coffee powder, a biscuit, butter cheese, noodles etc.    as the himalayan rescue association likes to point out,  the himalaya starts where other mountains leave off.  remember it is the sleeping altitude that is critical. if you ascend to an area of high altitude, you are likely to experience some form of altitude sickness. usually, the symptoms are mild and will improve if you descend. what counts as high altitude   high altitude refers to heights that are between 1,500 and 3,500m above sea level. very high altitude is from 3,500 to 5,500m above sea level. extreme altitude is from 5,500 to 7,500m above sea level. the way to prevent altitude sickness is to give the body enough time to get used to the rarefied air. a slow and steady ascent is vital. adequate hydration is also helpful. the body is constantly losing fluid from the lungs and the skin in the high, dry environment. drink enough to maintain a clear and abundant urine output. other measures include eating a high carbohydrate diet, climbing high during the day and coming lower down to sleep, and to mild to moderate activity during the rather than just lie around. almost all altitude problems can be avoided if symptoms are recognized and acted upon. the warning signs are headache, lack of appetite, nausea, feeling of tiredness, and sometimes vomiting. this stage of mild mountain sickness can be treated with aspirin or diamox for headache and something mild for the nausea and vomiting.    always ask your doctor for advice and read the patient information that comes with your medicine.

diplomatic ties with your home country, there should be one or more embassies in the country where you are traveling. the embassy is usually in the capital city. in some cases, there may be embassies in other large cities around the country as well.in france, for example, the u.s. has embassy offices in paris, marseilles, bordeaux, lyon, rennes, strasbourg and toulouse. it would be smart, when

such phrases as  yes, your honor,   no, your honor,  or whatever the judge is called. have your attorney prepare you in the customs of the courtroom, when you will stand, sit, respond, and so on.    depending on the country where you are traveling, and your reason for being there, you may explore whether some form of immunity might apply to you. talk with officials at the embassy and with your local attorney about this idea. if you can argue that immunity should apply, then you may be released right away.immunity is a complicated topic, with a range of different levels of coverage. in short, it means that national diplomats, their staff, and their families cannot be prosecuted for crimes in a foreign country. higher level diplomats and staff members have higher levels of immunity. if you believe you may be covered, you should notify local law enforcement officials of your position, and talk with the embassy staff to help make your case.  as an alternative to proceeding with the criminal trial process, your attorney and your embassy might work together to make a deal to have you leave the country. this could be either as an extradition or deportation.   being extradited generally means that you will go back to your home country and potentially face the same criminal charges there. you will still have to prove your innocence, but at least you could do it in your own country.alternatively, you might suggest deportation.the country with the charge against you may consider this a victory because it gets rid of you.    you could have your attorney, your embassy, and even people back at home make a plea for your release and return on human rights grounds. this will depend on the charge against you, the level of evidence, and the potential punishment. the more severe the punishment, the more relevant a human rights plea might be.a noted example is the case of otto warmbier, a student from the university of virginia, who was tried and convicted in north korea for the crime of  subversion,  when he took down a propaganda poster. he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. immediately following the sentence, american diplomats and the organization human rights watch condemned the sentence and tried to have warmbier released.

sometimes you see a postcard that you just know will make somebody laugh. get it  make a sport of it. like the gnome in the french film amelie, or the man who had a squirrel invade his home, sending postcards can be a game. there was a fellow who had a squirrel invade his house one summer. after two weeks of trying to catch it, he finally succeeded. he drove 20 miles  32 km  out of town, and released the squirrel. a few days later, he received a postcard from one  mr. fuzzy.  then another, then another, as the intrepid mr. fuzzy traveled the country. several friends jumped into the game, and by fall he had received postcards from major cities around the world. you too can create your own  mr. fuzzy.  make up an alias for yourself and send a friend or child postcards from all over, signed by your alias.    now that you have your prized possession in your hands, it s time to work on the details. a postcard s format is very straightforward.   flip the postcard photo side down. the top right corner is generally where the stamp goes  there should be a box in the corner that is perfectly stamp sized . postcards are usually split up so that the right side of the card has lines for you to write out the address you want the card to be sent to. on the left there should be a blank space in which you can write a message, doodle, or create a riddle that will lead the recipient on a cross country scavenger hunt.    this is optional but will give your recipient an idea of when you sent the postcard  and can also be a little experiment to see how long a postcard takes to get from canberra, australia to san francisco, usa . you might be surprised at how long or short the postcard s travel time is.    begin by addressing the person  or people  you are sending it to. a simple,  dear john,  would work, but you can get as creative as you like. try something like  to the man who once wore a 10 gallon  37.9 l  hat to an ice cream parlor  or  my dearest, most darling, beloved aunt nancy.     the first rule of postcard writing is, there are no rules. write as much or as little as you like. don t write at all but instead draw a picture depicting your favorite moment of your trip thus far. it really is up to you. some people choose to write as much as possible, filling up the text area, then writing along the bottom, up the right hand side, upside down along the top, and on down the left side. go wild so long as there is space to write your recipient s address. here are some ideas about what to write about    give your recipient an account of your favorite moment of the trip so far. something along the lines of  though this whole trip to panama has been amazing, yesterday something happened that was truly crazy. i discovered i have a sloth sense. the girls and i trekked through the jungle to find this beautiful hidden beach, and on the way i spotted four different sloths. each time one was near, i would stop walking and announce that there was a sloth around. i would look up, and sure enough, a sloth  right above me   another idea is to give an account of a weird food you have tried  you won t believe this but two days ago i tried kangaroo tail, crocodile meat, and a green ant, all in the same day  the kangaroo tail was a bit greasy but the crocodile tasted like  you guessed it   chicken. but most surprising of all, the green ant tasted like a sour grape  the land down under sure is an interesting place   you might consider closing with something like,  hope all is well  or  you would love it here   so that your recipient doesn t die of envy.    since formality is not a requirement for postcards, say goodbye like you were talking to them. when was the last time you said  sincerely yours  to somebody, face to face  instead, there are the old standbys   wish you were here    see you soon    love love love      or, you can sign off in a personalized way. examples are  love, your wandering granddaughter  or  signed, a broad abroad  or something pun y like that.    some cards will also have lines for you to write the address on. write the recipient s name s  followed by their address  house or apartment number, street name, town, city, country, zip code.    don t forget to add the country name  while you may not have to do that when sending snail mail within your own country, you will have to do that when you re abroad     before you can make the recipient green with jealousy  or red with embarrassment, if you are in brazil and sending one of those kinds of postcards , you will need to put a stamp on it up in the right hand corner. make sure you put the right amount of postage to get it to its destination, find a post office station, and drop that little slice of cardboard love in the mail.   if you re not sure how much postage it will take to get the postcard from one place to another, duck into the nearest post office and find out. make sure to purchase international postage if its required.   nan

query	176	    note the following     coloration  corrientes, like texas longhorns, come in a wide variety of coloration except white. however, most animals of this breed are primarily black.  body type and characteristics  animals of this breed are relatively small in comparison to other beef and sporting breeds, with mature cows only weighing up to 800 lbs and bulls around 1000 lbs. yearling bulls or steers reach only around 400 lbs. they are narrow and fine in conformation, with well balanced head, neck, forequarters and hindquarters. they tend to have a dense coat and a heavy tail switch that often extends below the hocks.  head characteristics  all corrientes are horned  except calves, which start growing horns when they are about a month old , and all tend to have hair in their ears along with their dense coat. heads are typically large in length and size in comparison with the rest of their body, making them an ideal breed for use in the rodeo circuit. special attention is made to their horns, which, though smaller than the texas longhorn or florida cracker pineywoods cattle, grow out straight, curving up to the front and up slightly, and are set fairly wide apart.  other characteristics  origins of this breed can be traced back to the first spanish imports that came to the americas and the west indies in 1493. they were used as a beef breed up until the early 1800 s, and had extended in population from the southern us to california. however, ranchers started to improve their herds with the use of more modern beef cattle, and the corriente lost ground, except for use in rodeos.  it is interesting to note that the word  corriente  didn t exactly refer to a specific breed. in parts of northern mexico, not only was this term often referred to cattle of various descendants of early spanish cattle  in south america, these same type of cattle are called  criollo  , but it was also frequently used for any small cattle of indiscriminate breeding  not just for the type of cattle recognized by the naca  north american corriente association .  corriente  became the most common term used at the us mexican border to refer to those cattle that were purchased for rodeo use. consequently, most cattlemen, bulldoggers and ropers knew this name, and so the naca chose this name to be used in the registry of these small horned cattle.  thus, this breed is used in rodeos for bulldogging  steer wrestling  and team roping competitions. they are often judged on strength, stamina, and performance qualities in the rodeo ring, which makes them a great sporting breed.   in florida, cousins of these mexican corriente still exist, though they are referred to as cracker cattle. in louisiana, these same animals are often referred to as scrub cattle. corrientes are small, yet very hardy and easy to tame. they are easy keepers  or good calvers , and tend to have a quality lean carcass characteristics. because of their size, they easily out do other breeds in terms of ability to live off of less feed and water required.     nan  take pictures of what you thought were corriente cattle, and compare them with pictures of corriente on the internet and in your cattle breeds book.  
query	177	 there is a reason why many styles of mild wheat beer, such as german hefeweizens and belgian wits, are served with a lemon wedge in the glass. the bright, lively citrus notes pair excellently with the smooth, earthy flavor of wheat beer.    lemon also pairs excellently with light lager style beers like pilsner and pale american lagers. in fact, a popular summer cocktail called a shandy takes advantage of this very pairing by combining pale lager beer and lemonade.    while this combination is not as popular, you may also find that lemon works well with rich, flavorful beers like stout, porter, and ipa. lemon could provide an energetic lift to the heavy chocolate notes of a stout, while lemon might also blend harmoniously with the grapefruit notes of a hoppy ipa.    the most straightforward way to brew lemon beer is to add a small amount of lemon juice to the beer during secondary fermentation. some of the sugars in the lemon juice will undergo fermentation, which will add complexity to the beer. however, the basic brightness of the lemon will remain present in the beer s finished flavor.    an option for adding more subtle lemon flavor to your beer is to steep lemon peel in the secondary fermenter. the lemon peel contains the fruit s essential oils, which are very flavorful and will not be metabolized by the yeast. you can also steep complementary spices in the secondary fermenter, such as clove or cinnamon.    a third option for making lemon beer is to use a prepared product such as lemon jam. the flavor in these products is often more concentrated than in lemon juice, and it won t tend to dissipate so much between fermentation and consumption. note that the sugar present in jams and jellies will increase the gravity of your beer.    of course, a simple way to make sure the lemon tastes as fresh as possible in your beer is to add it to your glass just before drinking. adding a lemon wedge to your beer glass can be an easy way to improve its presentation or even to test a beer recipe for the possible addition of lemon during fermentation.   nan

query	180	 roaches are omnivorous and seek dark, moist places . inspect areas around the baseboards of your floor, under or around pipes, anywhere there is food waste, behind electrical outlet covers, and narrow, hard to reach spaces are ripe for potential infestation. roaches prefer to leave their eggs protected in dark crevices if they are not viviparous or oviparous.    you can do this by blowing a portable fan around the area to provoke an escape response, or by using an intense sudden light source to provoke the escape response . leaving bait out without any pesticide is not recommended, as it will simply encourage infestation.    these are areas with regular food contact, exposure to water, or that are dark and inaccessible. these areas should be targeted regardless of observed infestation. boric acid has a strong prophylactic effect that kills generations of insects over time.    cockroaches have a number of scent glands used in communication and courtship that produce a distinctive smell, in some cases sweet, in others oily and musky. these are telltale signs of an area that is infested and should be targeted.some cockroaches are perching insects that can thrive on top of high surfaces like shelves, and these should be inventoried and cleared for application of the insecticide.    make sure this is done before preparing or applying the insecticide. clean surfaces and preventing standing water from building up deprive cockroaches of resources. bait is unnecessary with this insecticide, and eggs are less likely to be spread where there is no feeding resource for the female insect.    boric acid is a more effective insecticide, more soluble in water, and is equally unlikely to produce any lasting harm in humans. both can be applied as a powder and have identical methods of killing the insect.   boric acid will appear as large white crystals in suspension. boric acid can be bought as well, and is less hazardous than hydrochloric acid, which is required to convert borax into the far more effective insecticide, boric acid.   hydrochloric acid is sold commonly as muriatic acid as a solution to acidify swimming pools. hydrochloric acid should be handled with extreme caution. use gloves, eye protection, and respiratory protection  in a well ventilated area  and can cause significant harm. have baking soda on hand to neutralize any strong acid reaction that is unintended. do not use water to treat strong acid burns.  treat any excess solution with baking soda to neutralize the strong acid. do not pour the solution down the sink until you are sure it is neutralized. use litmus paper to test the acidity of the excess solution. when the crystals are dry they are ready for storage.    make sure it is clean, inert, clearly labelled container and free of moisture. proper storage and labeling is key to maintaining safety and avoiding accidentally ingesting the product, as it is visually quite similar to table salt. avoiding moisture will prevent unwanted large chunks from forming.   a recycled ketchup bottle can be used as a kind of bellows to distribute the insecticide powder in the tight space of an electrical outlet with minimal risk. squeeze the bottle to test and make sure dust comes out  take care to not get any in your eyes, mouth or nose . make sure the hole of the bottle you re using is large enough for the borax crystals to go through freely. borax is soluble in hot water, as is boric acid and can be dissolved and put in a spray bottle, and the dried residue of aqueous boric acid is essentially undetectable to the insect and low risk to humans. however, if you are applying it near electrical outlets use it as a powder.    it is unnecessary to mix it with bait, as it is not repellant to insects normally, and is tracked by the insect and spread as a surface toxin to other insects. once you have covered the areas take care that no food preparation or dusting occurs to prevent accidental ingestion.    this is an easy access to interior spaces in walls where roaches live and lay eggs. spray the borax into the space using your bottle like a bellows, squeezing repeatedly. replace the outlet covers when done. do not use dissolved borax.    the insecticide will spread among the colony through contact. complete coverage is desirable, but if any targeted areas have infestations, the insecticide will spread to other insects and kill them, and will not affect the desirability of food to the insects considerably.    the borax will destroy eggs and larvae in the carpet. vacuum up the powder some 20 minutes after application. any eggs or insects killed will go up with them. follow any rug care instructions.   if you targeted carpeted areas, vacuum a short time after application. any eggs will be killed in short order, but the insecticide dust can cause lung irritation or toxicity in pets and small children. it is not advisable to leave it in an area where it will be kicked up as dust continually.    reapply treatment after use, or after several days if roaches are still a problem. this is a relatively slow insecticide, but an extremely effective one.

query	182	 you will also need to have chess pieces, and a chess clock. try going for a simple and small sized board. a smaller board will make it easier to move the pieces across the board. plastic or wooden boards are okay.it is also an option to play online. for this you will need a computer, tablet, or mobile phone that has internet connection. make sure the clock you choose is durable enough to handle the punching during the last few seconds of the game.    you will need to learn the rules before playing blitz chess. first, familiarize yourself with the rules of standard chess. the rules are basically the same in standard and blitz chess. the only differences are the number of illegal moves allowed, and the timing formats.one illegal move can mean a loss in a game of blitz chess.    anyone that knows how to play the game will do. consider your level of playing when choosing an opponent. don t start off with someone that is much more advanced than you when you are a beginner.  players sometimes lose because of finger fatigue. stretching your fingers will help circulation as you play.make a gentle fist. hold for thirty seconds. then, release and spread your fingers wide. repeat four times.place your palm flat on a table. straighten your fingers as flat as you can against the surface of the table. hold for thirty seconds. release and repeat four times.    the person playing white gets the privilege of moving first, but the person playing black chooses which side of the table to sit on.    this includes how the pieces are set up, the time on the clocks, and the clock s orientation. once play begins, none of these can be changed.   the time on the clocks should be set to the amount of time you want to play the game. in a blitz game, you should set the clock between one to ten minutes. the clock should be placed on either side of the chess board. black decides which side of the board to place the clock.  wait for your opponent to move if you re playing black.   after every move, you must hit the plunger on your side of the chess clock with the same hand you used to move the chess piece. this pauses your clock and starts your opponent s. if you forget to hit the clock, your opponent moves, and you catch it before they correct the mistake, it is considered an illegal move and your opponent loses the match. remember that the point of blitz chess is playing a fun, fast chess game. if you take too long to agonize over your moves, you ll lose. you should only take a few seconds at most to make a move.    ways of winning include    mating  checkmating  the king, by threatening to capture him on the next move in such a way that he cannot escape. your opponent can resign if there is no way to win. the small plastic flag on your opponent s clock falls before yours, indicating that he has run out of time. according to some rule sets, he can keep playing until you notice the flag fall and comment on it. you notice that your opponent made an illegal move before your next move. the chess game can also be declared a draw by mutual agreement, if there s no way for either to win, if the kings are stalemated, or if your opponent runs out of time or makes an illegal move, yet you don t have sufficient resources on the board to checkmate his king.    a game of blitz chess is not that different from any other game of chess. blitz chess is just played much faster. the fast paced game of blitz chess may be too overwhelming for someone who is new to the game of chess. a good way to get better at blitz chess is to improve your game of standard chess.  blitz chess can often seem harder than standard chess because the short time of the game makes the player emotional and excited. try playing a slightly longer game. playing a longer game will help you train to think clearly and rationally while playing.  the best way to improve at blitz chess is to play with more advances players that challenge you to better your game. it may get tiring to play with much more advanced players too often, so practice with other players of mixed levels of strength.try playing with a player that you beat 1 out of 4 to 1 of 8 games against. occasionally play with weaker players. this will build your confidence, and help the weaker players improve their games.    chess is thought to be 80  tactics, and it is not any different for blitz chess. pay attention to your and your opponent s positions while playing. spotting your opponent s tactics and tactical mistakes will give an advantage in the game.

query	184	 when you notice signs of asthma  coughing, wheezing, open mouthed breathing , take your cat to your vet. they will perform various diagnostic tests, such as chest x rays, to diagnose the asthma.once your vet has made the diagnosis, they will discuss the various treatment options with you.   the main feline asthma treatment options are corticosteroids   steroids  , which reduce inflammation, and bronchodilators, which open the airways.    steroid treatment for feline asthma is either oral, injectable, or inhaled.long acting injectable steroids, which can be administered by your vet, would be good if your cat doesn t like taking pills.the inhaled steroid, called fluticasone, is a popular treatment choice for feline asthma.   your vet can help you decide which form of steroid would work best for your cat. be aware the dose of an injectable steroid can t be reduced once the steroid is given you may have to wait for the effects to wear off.to give a steroid pill, consider hiding it in a pill pocket.pill pockets are available at your local pet store.    you will need a metered dose inhaler  mdi , cat specific spacer  also called a chamber , and face mask. first, acclimate your cat to the spacer and face mask by holding the face mask on your cat s face for gradually longer periods of time  up to about 20 seconds , then attaching the spacer. your vet can show you how to give the inhaled steroid shake the mdi and attach it to the spacer. press down on the mdi to deliver the prescribed dose into the spacer. place the unit on your cat s face and wait for your cat to take about 10 to 15 breaths.    with whichever form of steroid you give your cat, make sure you follow your vet s prescription instructions carefully. this will help your cat get the most benefit from this type of treatment.    examples of steroid side effects are increased appetite, increased water intake, and increased urination. inhaled steroids can produce side effects like throat irritation and voice loss. inhaled steroids usually have fewer side effects than oral or injectable steroids.cats that are overweight or have certain medical conditions  diabetes, heart disease  may have a higher risk of side effects when taking steroids.  steroids are very effective at reducing the inflammation and mucus buildup seen with feline asthma.if you give your cat inhaled steroids, it may be two weeks before your cat s asthma start to improve.you may see the effects of oral or injectable steroids sooner.    bronchodilators are fast acting medications that are usually reserved for asthma emergencies. however, they can also be given each day to cats that take daily steroids.your vet will determine if your cat needs a bronchodilator every day or just on an  as needed  basis.   long acting bronchodilators, which last up to 12 hours, can be given daily for cats that need more daily control of their asthma. emergency bronchodilators last about two to four hours.  like steroids, bronchodilators can be inhaled, injected, or given orally. the inhaled bronchodilator, called albuterol, is very effective for emergency asthma flare ups. terbutaline, which is another bronchodilator, can be injected.terbutaline can also be given orally as a syrup, but can make a cat act a little spacey.an inhaled bronchodilator is given in the same way as an inhaled steroid. bronchodilators are usually not prescribed as the only asthma treatment because they don t reduce airway inflammation.  bronchodilators work quickly to open up the airways. albuterol can open up a cat s airways in about 5 to 10 minutes. the longer acting bronchodilators take about 15 to 30 minutes to have an effect.  because cats can have asthma attacks just like people, you will need to know what to do if your cat has a severe asthma attack. give your cat albuterol  under the supervision of your vet once a diagnosis has been reached , which is a very effective emergency bronchodilator.a cat having an asthma attack will hunch its body toward the ground and extend its neck forward.however, this is a general sign of respiratory distress, rather than specific to asthma. even if you normally give your cat a long acting bronchodilator, your vet may prescribe the albuterol so you can have it on hand for emergency situations.    a cat with serious breathing trouble needs immediate veterinary care.giving your cat the albuterol will open the airways and make your cat s breathing a little easier. while the albuterol is taking effect, contact your vet or an emergency vet hospital and let them know your cat is having an asthma attack.    a cat having a serious asthma attack may need to be hospitalized until it is stable and strong enough to go back home.if your cat needs to be hospitalized, your vet will give your cat a bronchodilator and oxygen therapy.they will monitor your cat s breathing and its overall health.    cats develop asthma when they inhale something from the environment that irritates their airways. it s probably not practical for you to identify every single substance your cat could be allergic to. however, you can look for a few substances that could trigger your cat s asthma perfume or cologne. scented laundry detergent. cigarette smoke. carpet freshener. hairspray. dust.    if you know what allergens trigger your cat s asthma, you can take steps to reduce your cat s exposure to those allergens. for example, if dust is a trigger, put dust free litter in your cat s litter box.no cat litters are 100  dust free. however, some brands of litter  nature s miracle, tidy cat pure nature  contain minimal dust.cats don t always like change, so don t switch litter types too quickly. incorporate a little bit of the new litter into the old litter, then slowly increase the amount of new litter until that s the only litter in the litter box.    air filters trap particles in the air that could trigger your cat s asthma. replacing them regularly, according to the product label instructions, will help lower the amount of asthma inducing particles in the air in your home.  vacuuming your home will help keep dust and mold spores out of the air.daily vacuuming could quickly become tedious, so aim to vacuum your home about once a week.    cigarette smoke can trigger an asthma attack in a cat.if you smoke, do so outside of your home.

query	186	 every person has individual nutritional needs. a medical professional can help you decide whether full fat or low fat dairy is the best choice for you. they will consider factors like age, weight, and whether or not you have a medical condition. for example, full fat milk is generally recommended by dietitians for children under the age of 2.    full fat dairy consumption is linked to lower rates of obesity. this is contrary to popular belief that full fat dairy products are less healthful than reduced or low fat dairy. for example, researchers in scandinavia found that those who consumed full fat dairy products were less likely to be obese than people who ate low fat dairy products.  a study conducted by researchers at the harvard school of public health found that people who ate full fat dairy products were less likely to develop diabetes than those who didn t. those who regularly included full fat dairy products in their diets were between 44 and 52 percent less likely to end up with diabetes.  eating full fat cheese is associated with maintaining healthy cholesterol levels  hdl , while not increasing bad cholesterol levels  ldl . higher healthy cholesterol levels decrease your risk of heart disease.  low fat dairy products have fewer calories than their full fat counterparts. this can be an important consideration if you are counting calories. if you re looking to cut calories a low fat dairy product is a good choice.in general, low fat dairy still contains the same amount of calcium and vitamin d as full fat dairy.    low fat dairy products can be higher in sugar. sugar is often added to make up flavor deficiencies when fat is removed from a product. for example, low fat yogurt can have a considerably higher amount of sugar than full fat yogurt.  it is common for salt to be added to low fat dairy products. this enhances the flavor that is lost when the product s fat content is reduced. for example, low fat cheese can contain more sodium than full fat cheese. this is especially important to consider if you are watching your sodium intake.  full fat dairy products can have a different texture than low fat dairy products. for example, whole milk is thicker and richer than skim milk. low fat cheese, on the other hand, can be more brittle in texture and less springy when compared to full fat cheese.  there is often a notable difference in how full fat dairy tastes compared to low fat products. for example, whole milk has a richer flavor than skim milk. full fat cheese and full fat yogurt can also be more flavorful than their low fat counterparts, depending on the variety and type.  not all dairy cooks up the same. for example, low fat cheese may not melt in the same way that full fat cheese does. pay attention to the recipe you are following to determine if full fat or low fat dairy is the best choice for your cooking needs.    you might choose a low fat dairy product to cut back on calories and fat. these products can be less satisfying that their full fat counterparts. a lack of satisfaction can lead to eating more than the recommended serving. if you have more than one serving, you may consume more calories or fat than a single serving of a full fat dairy product.

drinks like margaritas and mojitos in moderation. however, make sure to make them with sugar free mixes. if you would like to make mojitos and martinis, you can use an alternative to sugar, like stevia.  fruity drinks don t have to be completely cut out. when you make mixed drinks, like daiquiris, consider using all fresh fruit for the mixture instead of a syrup or bottled mix. this can help cut added sugar and give you the same fruity flavor.  if you like mixed drinks with soda, drink the same thing with a sugar free or diet version. a cocktail made with sugar free or diet soda has no carbs, unlike one made with regular soda. regular soda may contain over 20 grams of carbs.when making them at home, you can add a diet coke to your whiskey and coke, or ask for diet when ordering one at a restaurant or bar.    most people who have diabetes can drink small amounts of alcohol. however, you want to make sure to drink in moderation. too much alcohol can negatively affect your blood sugar.due to the risks of drinking with diabetes, it is best to err on the side of caution regarding the number of drinks you consume. women should stick one alcoholic drink per day. men should only have two drinks in a day.  when you have diabetes and decide to have a drink, make sure to limit the serving size. many cocktails, beers, or wines you can get at a restaurant or bar are too large. try thinking about the following serving sizes 12 ounces of beer 5 ounces of wine 1.5 ounces of liquor 1.5 ounce of liqueur    you should never drink on an empty stomach. you should also not substitute your carbs or sugars from a meal as alcohol. eating regular meals helps your body process the alcohol and alcohol sugars.you should also check your blood sugar to make sure your blood sugar is stable.

query	191	 as with any instrument, there s a proper way to hold your french horn to get the best sound possible when you play it.   sit up in a chair with your back straight so that you can breathe into the horn without obstruction. put your feet flat on the floor, parallel to each other. hold the horn at a 45 degree angle with the mouthpiece toward your face. cup your hand and place your left thumb on the thumb key. put your left index, middle, and ring fingers on the three keys on top. your left pinkie should be through pinkie ring, and your right hand inside of the bell. now that your fingers are in place, bring the horn up so that the mouthpiece is against your lips.    to blow into the mouthpiece, you have to first learn how to purse your lips. this is called,  embouchure.    practice saying,  mmmm  with your mouth, slowly adding pressure between your lips. your lips should form a frown. the corners of your mouth should stay in place, almost as if you re puckering your lips.it s a good idea to practice in front of a mirror to make sure you re getting your form right.  without pressing any of the valves, you can use the embouchure technique to blow into the mouthpiece of the horn.   you want to blow into the horn using fast, quick blows.make sure you re not pressing your mouth into the mouthpiece too hard. if your teeth hurt or a ring appears on your lips, you re pressing too hard. you want a relaxed tension against the mouthpiece when you blow into it.  it will make your life a lot easier to learn exactly where the keys are so that your fingers know where to go when you re playing.   through repeated playing muscle memory builds, so your fingers know where the keys are. practices pressing the keys, knowing which keys you re pressing. do this until you can pass a test of accuracy.it can help to have a fingering chart while you practice.  the volume of the notes you play will depend on how much air you blow into the horn, and how fast. the more air you blow, and the faster you blow it, the louder the note will sound  and vice versa .  to be a good french horn player you ll want to learn how to read music.   sheet music is the basis of many musical performances. you can also learn by ear, but most songs are played from sheet music. learning sheet music gives you a deeper understanding of how your instrument works, as well as music theory.  the most basic thing you ll learn first is the order of the notes and how they re placed on a music staff.many parts go into the relationship between notes and the staff. that s why this piece is so fundamental.    once you ve memorized the notes, the next step is to understand how the clefs work.there are two clefs that can show up on a music staff. the treble clef notates the higher pitches of music, and the bass clef notates the lower pitches.    sheet music notates how fast or slow a song is by the tempo. it s usually notated at the top of the sheet using a bpm  beats per minute  measurement.  once you have a pretty good understanding of the basics of sheet music, try playing a simple melody. pick something that only has a few notes and practice until you ve mastered it.    eventually, you can practice playing more complex melodies. this will help you play your instrument better and help you become better at reading sheet music.   pick music that has a variety of note structures, clefs, and tempos.    now that you can hold your instrument and play sitting down, it s time to play standing up. a french horn weighs about 4 pounds. there won t be many times when you ll need to play standing up, but recitals are a common one.since your right hand is in the bell anyway, just slide it up to the top of the bell so that it s resting on your hand. all your other hand placements stay the same. you can buy small modification pieces that help hold up the horn easier.    once you ve mastered the basics you re ready to learn more advanced playing techniques. it can be helpful to recruit a tutor or advanced player for these skills.   muting  or stopping  the horn creates a high pitched sound from the bell. you can stop the horn by moving your hand further into the bell until it s in all the way. twist it until little or no air can get out.slurring notes are playing two notes without stopping or releasing between. to do this you ll continue to change the notes on your keys but your airflow remains constant and steady.playing glissando is starting and ending on specific notes while playing as many notes between as you can.  lessons are a great way to learn advanced skills and get feedback on your progress. you can hire private tutors or join group classes. some classes will play at events, giving you an opportunity to show off your new chops.    you can find a lot of useful tutorial videos online. some of them will teach you to play using sheet music, and some will teach you to play by ear. if you search, you should find what you re looking for.    the most effective way to become a better horn player is to practice. make time to play your horn on a regular basis. create challenges for yourself by upping the ante on songs you play.   you can get books of sheet music that have a variety of songs with different levels of difficulty. tutor books sometimes include training schedules, often with lessons on reading sheet music.  don t be afraid to ask questions when you get stuck or aren t sure how to do something. there are lots of places you can go to get your questions answered.   you can consult tutors, french horn websites, video comment threads, and forums.    when you re not playing your horn, store it in a padded case. most cases have a hard shell to protect it from damage.    each time you play your horn you should clean it. this will prolong the life of the instrument.   polish it using a polishing cloth. if it s dirty, you can apply polishing gauze with a cloth.let the interior of the instrument dry. remove the valve slides and dry those while the rest of the body is drying.  every week or two you ll want to conduct routine maintenance on your instrument to make sure it stays in good condition for as long as possible.   clean the mouthpiece with dish soap and water. it might also be helpful to use a mouthpiece brush, which you can find at most music stores.oil the rotors and valves. remove the valve caps and apply key oil to the pivot points and bearing shaft.you ll know the valves need to be oiled if they stick.apply slide grease to the tuning slides. remove them, put the grease on them, and replace them.  every once in a while, you should do a full cleanse on your horn. that means flushing out the entire instrument with soap and water. use a brush to clean the tuning slides.if you want to take special care you can use brass soap to clean the horn.make sure you apply grease to the tuning slides before putting them back on the body of the horn.  if anything on your horn breaks, take it to a shop and get it repaired. it s a delicate piece of machinery that won t work if some of the parts are defective.  
query	192	 any time you hear grinding while driving your vehicle means trouble. grinding while trying to put a manual transmission into or out of gear can be indicative of your clutch failing to engage or disengage completely or it may be a result of worn synchro gears in the transmission itself. if you hear grinding while in gear, it means there is metal caught in the gears of the transmission and it will likely fail very soon.pull the vehicle over immediately if you hear grinding while moving. you will need to have your vehicle towed home or to a repair facility. if the transmission grinds going into or out of certain gears, you can try double clutch shifting to get it through the gears without causing more damage.    there are many things that can cause vibrations as you drive. while some may be as benign as a rock stuck in your tire or ice on your rims, others can indicate a serious issue with your transmission. if you hear or feel a new vibration as you drive, pull over and check your wheels and tires first. if they appear not to have any issues to speak of, the vibration is likely due to a problem with the drivetrain.the drivetrain in your vehicle includes the engine, transmission, transfer cases and drive shafts. try to get a sense of wear in the vehicle the vibration is coming from.    while driving and diagnosing a vibration, accelerate by pressing on the gas and assess whether or not the vibration speeds up, slows down or goes away. now take the vehicle out of gear  in neutral  and press on the gas again. determine if there is a difference between how the vibration acts in each instance. if the vibration only occurs at certain speeds, it may be an unbalanced wheel. if the vibration goes away or stays constant while the vehicle is not in gear, it may be an issue with the wheels or drive shafts going to them. if the vibration increases with the rpms of the engine, the issue is likely in the engine or transmission.    when driving a vehicle equipped with an automatic transmission, pay attention to the way it shifts from gear to gear. automatic transmissions should shift fairly smoothly. if shifting feels abrupt or causes you to lurch forward, the transmission is struggling to shift into the next gear.hard shifting could indicate low or over worn transmission fluid. pull over at a safe location and ensure the transmission fluid is not too low before driving the vehicle home.    automatic transmissions are designed to shift at different rpms based on the amount of throttle you input. if you are accelerating quickly  with the pedal to the floor  the transmission will shift at a higher rpm than under normal driving. that said, the transmission should not allow the vehicle to sit at a high rpm for long before shifting to the next gear. if it is, there is an issue.you can usually hear when your car plateau s at an rpm it should be shifting from. listen for the sound of the engine working harder than it normally would as it stays in a lower gear for too long.    a common cause of issues with automatic transmissions is low fluid levels caused by leaks. look beneath your vehicle for wet spots. if you find one, touch it with your finger, then wipe your finger on a white sheet of paper to determine what kind of fluid it is by color.automatic transmission fluid is usually red, or dark red if it is old and has been burned. coolant is usually green or orange. oil is usually brown or black.    if you have seen signs of leaking, check your transmission immediately by locating the dip stick for your transmission fluid. much like an oil dipstick, there will be minimum and full lines clearly shown on the stick. remove the dipstick and wipe it off, then re insert it and remove it again to check the fluid levels. if the fluid level is low, adding transmission fluid may resolve the issue you re having. if you are unsure where to find the transmission fluid dipstick in your vehicle, refer to its owner s manual for guidance. check the transmission fluid levels even if there is no sign of leaking, just in case it was not filled completely when it was last serviced or if it has been burning fluid.    look at the fluid on the dipstick and assess the color. automatic transmission fluid is dark red in color, but it grows darker the longer it is in use. dark color is not necessarily indicative of an issue unless it is nearly black in color and smells burnt. conversely, if the color is extremely light or pink, it means water has gotten into the transmission fluid, which is also a serious problem. draining and flushing your transmission fluid is not always a viable solution, but in some cases it is required.black or extremely dark red transmission fluid means the transmission has been operating at above its safe temperature range. pink transmission fluid means there s water in the fluid. you will need to drain the transmission and replace the fluid. the source of the water in your transmission fluid must be identified and repaired or it will occur again.    with your foot on the brake, shift your vehicle out of park and into reverse or drive. while at a stop, shifting out of park should be nearly instantaneous. count to yourself as you wait. if your count exceeds three seconds, the transmission is not operating the way it should. this may be indicative of over worn or low transmission fluid.sluggish shifting, particularly into drive or reverse, often means the transmission fluid is too low or not performing properly. if the vehicle won t shift out of park at all, it could mean that the transmission has internal issues and will need to be serviced or replaced.    while stopped with the vehicle running, apply the parking brake and press the clutch pedal to the floor. shift the transmission through each gear, starting with first and culminating with the highest gear your vehicle s transmission is equipped with. it should shift into each gear smoothly and without any grinding or crunching.if the vehicle cannot shift into any gears, your clutch may have failed. if you have issues shifting into a specific gear, it is likely the result of a failed synchro for that gear.    manual transmissions are usually lubricated by gear oil instead of automatic transmission fluid  except in specific applications . many manual transmissions have dipsticks similar to those found in automatic transmissions. remove the dipstick and ensure the fluid level is correct.if you are unable to find the dipstick on your transmission, refer to your owner s manual for guidance. if you need to add gear oil, be sure to check your owner s manual for the correct type of oil to add.    when checking the gear oil in your transmission, determining if it has been burned through overheating will be fairly easy. burned gear oil has a powerful odor that may resemble onions. if the gear oil in your transmission is burned, it will making shifting more difficult and may lead to a breakdown of the components inside.burned gear oil will need to be drained and replaced. if the wrong gear oil is added, it may be more likely to burn and lead to mechanical failures. if the wrong oil has been added to your transmission, it will also need to be drained and replaced.    if you hear a noise that seems to come from the transmission at an idle, press the clutch in and continue to listen. if the sound changes or stops, it is likely caused by a problem with the release or pilot bearing. other common issues you may be able to diagnose by sound are a growling or grinding noises when the clutch is engaged likely means a problem with the transmission input shaft bearing. if you depress the clutch and hear a squealing sound, it is likely caused by a bad pilot bearing or bushing. a chirping sound that gets louder as you slowly depress the clutch pedal is likely caused by a faulty release bearing.

quite cheap and fairly high quality. cameras with sd cards are widely available and user friendly.  hd cameras can run anywhere between a few hundred and a few thousand dollars and will look very professional. many low budget hollywood movies have been shot on basic hd cameras you can buy at electronics stores like best buy, or even explore renting options in your area.    whether you re shooting a birthday party, concert, a wedding, or some other event, get to the place early and do some scouting to see the right angles for shooting video. find a few comfortable positions and shoot from multiple angles to get different footage that you ll be able to edit together later into a nice product.   if you ve got a helper, you can shoot simultaneously from different angles to provide cuts in your finished product with editing. this can be a cool effect that will make your finished product seem finished and professional. try to stay out of peoples  way, especially if there s a sizable crowd. you want to get the close shot and the right angle, but you re not the only one there. make sure everyone can see and shoot from a reasonable distance.  to be ready for spontaneous moments, keep the camera going  pick the right time to start and let the camera warm up, so the video begins before the actual action you want to capture. if you try to fire up the camera when you see your kid sprinting toward the goal, ready to take a shot in the championship soccer game, it s likely you ll miss it. if you ve been filming since half time, though, you ll be ready.   don t try to edit together your video on the fly. it s better to avoid lots of stops and starts to the video, because you ll have trouble remember what shot happened when, which will be much easier to sort out if you ve got longer shots. you can edit out the unnecessary bits later, but most cameras have lots of room on them, so take advantage of it.    if you re using the camera on your cellphone, or any camera that isn t steadied with a tripod, try to hold it as steady as possible. shakiness and blurriness from an unsteady hand can make important video footage frustrating and unwatchable. sit down while shooting and steady your arms on your knees, if necessary, or invest in a tripod that ll keep the camera steady on the ground.   a common mistake on iphone cameras involves holding the phone vertically while taking video, as opposed to horizontally. when you upload the video to your computer later to edit it  if you want to  you ll have annoying bars on either side of the screen. shoot the  landscape  style and hold the camera long ways. it ll show up sideways on your phone, but you can tilt it later on your computer and it ll look right.    if you re just using the built in mic on your camera and not trying to capture sound with other microphones, you ll have a lot of trouble hearing the action unless you re quite close.    after you ve shot the raw footage, upload it onto your computer and edit it. most cameras can be connected via usb cords or by an sd card that you can remove and load into a  usually  usb converter. follow the instructions for the particular camera that you ve used.   save the raw footage as a separate document so you can feel free to edit and make changes. you can always go back to the original footage if necessary, confident that you won t lose any of it. you can always start over.    unless you shot everything perfectly and want to keep your video as is, it s best to use a user friendly editing software that will allow you to trim, adjust, add music, and otherwise clean up the raw video that you ve captured. if you want to add captions or boost the audio, you ll need to open the footage with some kind of editing software.    popular free versions of editing software include   imovie windows movie maker avidemux    professional editing software includes   apple final cut pro corel videostudio pro adobe premiere elements      when you ve loaded the footage into the software, start cutting out anything that you don t want in the final product. cut repetitive scenes, or trim down everything to the bare essentials and start organizing your best footage. depending on the kind of video you want to make, you may want more shaky and informal footage, or you may want a clean and professional product. use your judgement depending on the project.    move scenes around to switch the order if it improves the video. if you re documenting a party or another event, don t worry so much about staying true to  the way things really happened  and make the best possible version of the video that you re making. tell a story.    most editing software includes lots of options that allow you to smoothly transition from one scene into another scene, making it easy to move things around and make changes. avoid hard or disjunctive cuts, unless that s an effect you hope to include in the video for some reason.   imovie and other kinds of software has lots of complicated fades and transitions that you can use, but use them sparingly. it can distract from the final video if you get carried away. stay true to the content and make the video the most important thing, not the fancy transition you just learned how to do on the computer.    if it fits the video you want to make, upload music that s on your computer and use it in the background as a soundtrack to montage moments in your video, or take the sound out entirely if its not important, and use music in its place. this can be a good way to lively up camera phone video that might not have audio as good as the quality of its video.    when you re finished, finalize the project by exporting the finished video into a video file, like a .avi or a .mov. open in a playback software like windows media player or quicktime and check out your work.    after you ve exported the file, consider how you d like to share your work with others. you could burn your video onto a dvd to provide physical copies to people. this is a particularly good option if you ve taken wedding footage, or footage of another kind of private event that was attended by a small group of people who would be interested in the footage.   if the video has wider appeal, upload your video to youtube. as long as it s short enough, you can create a youtube account and upload your video relatively quickly. it ll be online in no time and then you ll be able to share the link with anyone you want. if you want your video online, but would prefer it stay somewhat private, you can upload privately with a vimeo account. the video will be password protected and very high quality, meaning that you can share it freely with anyone who you provide the password with, but it won t be visible to just anyone.  
query	200	 the best way to use your hybrid car efficiently is to not use it at all. walk or bike to your destinations when possible. you could also use public transport, such as buses, trains, and subways. alternately, grab a ride with a friend and carpool to your destinations.    most hybrid drivers say that to maximize their hybrid s possibilities for efficiency, they must re learn how to drive.while things like watching their speedometer and using cruise control are not foreign to the experience of driving a regular car, they become crucial aspects of driving a hybrid.   keep an eye on the dashboard fuel economy display, if present.this display will give you a real time update about your fuel efficiency. incorporate driving styles that are fuel efficient into your regular driving behavior. use your brakes. hybrids employ a technology known as regenerative braking. this means that the energy produced by the brakes    wasted as heat in normal cars    is used to recharge the battery of your hybrid.apply gentle, even pressure to the brakes and gently glide to a stop. don t brake too soon. give yourself enough distance and space to effectively brake.    hov lanes are designed to reduce traffic during rush hour and peak travel times by vehicles with two or more people. certain states also allow hybrid cars to make use of hov lanes even if they contain only one passenger.   california, for instance, permits hybrid car drivers to use the hov lane if they have a clean air vehicle sticker and their car is on the approved list. see http   www.arb.ca.gov msprog carpool carpool.htm for more information. virginia offers a similar program.check their list of approved hybrid vehicles at http   www.dmv.virginia.gov vehicles  cleanspecialfuel.asp to discover whether your hybrid can be used in hov lanes. however, you will not be able to drive the car in hov lanes on i 95 or i 494 with less than three passengers.    your hybrid car s fuel efficiency will decline when you drive over 55 miles per hour. if you drive with the cruise control set to 70 miles per hour or more, turn it off, especially on an incline. try to aim for a top highway speed of around 60 miles per hour.don t be afraid to ride in the slow lane. let other cars pass you. use moderate acceleration.accelerating too quickly will cause both the gas and electric engines to operate in tandem. when heading up a hill, try find that goldilocks zone with your hybrid car    an acceleration level that is neither too slow nor too fast. drifting in either direction will cause your mileage and fuel efficiency to decline.    monitor fuel efficiency while you use each. for instance, try accelerating slowly for a few weeks, then try accelerating a bit faster, and then try accelerating more quickly. compare the mileage results of the different techniques and adopt the most fuel efficient one.   after reaching your desired speed, coast as long as possible until you need to stop or turn. be mindful of how you start your vehicle at stoplights. your hybrid is programmed to turn off the engine when in park or when you re not moving.it will turn on again when you resume motion. use your foot to gently apply pressure to the gas pedal to start the car in motion.    with the cruise control on, you re less likely to rev the engine and accelerate quickly, which can cause the gas engine to kick in to provide the extra push that rapid acceleration requires. lay off the gas and set your cruise control to your desired speed whether you re on the highway or on a street.if you don t have cruise control, try to keep your speed constant. not only does accelerating your vehicle use energy, slowing it wastes your energy as well. a constant speed is the most energy efficient for your vehicle.    if your battery is fully charged, it will more quickly wear out. similarly, if your battery is totally or nearly depleted, it will have an adverse affect on the total number of charges you ll be able to get out of it.keep an eye on your battery s gauge. when you ve charged it to an upper mid range value, around 80 , end the recharging process. don t let the battery s power drop beyond 20 .   some hybrid manufacturers have factored this fact into their design, and have safeguards in place from preventing a battery from actually reaching a totally full or totally empty state. consult your user manual for specifics about how to manage your battery s charge levels.    keeping your battery warm really means keeping your car warm. if a battery gets cold, the amount of energy you can get out of it decreases.during winter, keep your hybrid in the garage to spare it from the worst of the cold weather.   turn on your car and let it sit idle for a bit in order to get the battery warmed. excessive heat can be bad for your battery, too. a battery at ninety two degrees fahrenheit will only last five years. keep your car in the garage and out of direct sunlight.    your hybrid might offer the option of choosing when to switch from the battery to the gasoline engine. when possible, use the battery, since you will save money on gasoline. in some cases, such as highway driving, hybrids will generally switch over to the gasoline engine automatically.   drive within your vehicle s battery range. most hybrids allow between 10 and 35 miles of driving exclusively on the electric battery before they need to transition to a gasoline engine.keep your drives short and at a close distance from your home. stay close to home with your hybrid to maximize its efficiency.    figure out if you want a full hybrid, an assist, a plugin, or a mild hybrid. weigh the pros and cons of each before making a purchase decision.   one design option you need to choose is whether to get a parallel or a series hybrid. a parallel hybrid is one in which both electric and gas engine can be used in tandem. most hybrids are of this type. some, however, are of the series type, in which only the gas or only the battery can operate at any given time.full hybrids can run on electricity alone. mild hybrids are those in which the gas engine is on all the time, and the electric battery only provides an extra boost. plugin hybrids can be plugged into the wall at your home or  if facilities exist  your workplace, but the gas engine will not recharge the batteries as in a non plugin hybrid. the decision you make about what kind of hybrid you want comes down to your motivations and your budget. if you re an eco warrior, you might want to choose a full or parallel hybrid. if you make a lot of long trips but still want to improve your gas mileage, a series or mild hybrid might be for you. always purchase a car within your price range.    many employers offer financing and rebates for employees who want to purchase a hybrid car.hyperion, for instance, offers  5,000 for employees who wish to purchase a hybrid. the company commits  1 million each year toward its hybrid incentive program. google, likewise offers  5,000 for employees that purchase  fuel efficient  vehicles, which means many hybrids qualify for this rebate. they also offer  2,500 for leased vehicles.   the federal government offers rebates of up to  7,500 on plugin hybrid vehicles that were purchased after 2010.many states also offer similar incentives on purchasing fuel efficient or hybrid vehicles. check federal and state regulations to determine if you could get a rebate on your vehicle. for a full list of state incentive programs, check out http   www.afdc.energy.gov laws state. for a full list of vehicles that qualify for federal rebates and incentives, visit https   www.fueleconomy.gov feg taxevb.shtml.    look around and compare prices on the car you want. purchase your hybrid at the lowest price possible.   additionally, plan on negotiating with the dealership salesperson. you can often knock ten to twenty percent of the posted price of a car with some haggling. you could also compare prices among different hybrid cars. for instance, if two different hybrid cars vary in only a few unimportant features  for instance, maybe one has passenger video screens in it while another doesn t , you should choose the car with the lower price. always test drive cars you think you might want to buy. if the car doesn t meet your specifications, look elsewhere for one that will.

query	206	 in britain and other places where marmite is popular, it s often eaten as a spread on toast, crackers, and other baked bread products. since marmite has such a strong salty, yeasty taste, it s usually eaten in small quantities even by its fans. if you re using your marmite as a spread, rather than using a full spoonful of it like you might for jam or peanut butter, instead, use a tiny pea sized amount  like you would for toothpaste .   ideally, when you spread this tiny amount of marmite on your bread, it should leave a paper thin layer of marmite   just enough to discolor the bread. you don t want any noticeable  thickness  to the marmite, as this will give a seriously overpowering taste.    one of the most common ingredients to combine with marmite is butter, especially when the marmite is being used as a spread. butter s rich, smooth taste pairs well with the strong, salty flavor of marmite. if you hate marmite, try applying a generous helping of butter to your bread before or after you spread on the marmite   the more you use, the less you ll taste the marmite.to many, this makes marmite much more palatable.    getting used to eating marmite is like the old saying about how to boil a frog   if you drop a frog into a pot of hot water, it will jump out, but if you drop it into a pot of lukewarm water and slowly increase the heat, it won t know anything s wrong until it s too late rather than trying to wolf down your marmite in a few huge bites, instead, take small nibbles to begin. gradually, as you make progress, the strong, salty taste should become more bearable.   if you re having a hard time swallowing even small bites of your marmite spread, try moving each bite carefully to the back of your mouth so that you can swallow it without much chewing. this should minimize the amount you have to taste the marmite, but be careful   you ll need to take small bites to be able to swallow them without choking.    to keep the overpowering taste of marmite under control, try taking a drink after each bite of marmite you take. the drink will act as a chaser   the more you sip, the less you ll taste the marmite and the quicker the taste will leave your mouth.   plain, ordinary tap water is a good zero calorie chaser, but if you really hate the taste of marmite, you may want to consider a stronger tasting beverage. after each bite, try drinking a swig of your favorite soft drink, or, if you re old enough, a stiff cocktail. the strong flavors of these beverages should help  drown out  the marmite taste.    the senses of taste and smell closely interact with each other to produce the  effect  that you experience when eating food. the way something smells can affect the way it tastes to you  and vice versa .if you hate the taste of marmite, there s a very good chance you won t care for its smell, either. in this case, try your hardest not to smell the marmite as you eat it. usually, the taste, though still strong, will be a little less intense if you make an effort to hold your breath until the marmite has been swallowed  or nearly so .    perhaps the single easiest way to make marmite more manageable is to simply not make it the central feature of your dish. pairing marmite with other foods  especially ones with distinctive, powerful flavors of their own  can make it much more palatable. though you may never enjoy marmite by itself, you may even find that you enjoy it when paired with other foods or used as a minor ingredient in a large recipe    there s no  wrong  way to eat marmite   any food you enjoy it with is fair game. just a few foods that some marmite fans enjoy pairing their favorite yeasty spread with are eggs, cheese, meat, seafood, apricots, marmalade, and more in the next section, we ll explore a few more flavorful marmite combinations. feel free to use any of them as you see fit, or make your own     in small quantities, marmite can give soups, stews, and other hearty liquid dishes a rich, savory flavor  and also works great as a browning agent . for instance, try mixing a spoonful of marmite into a pot of french onion soup in place of beef stock   the flavor of the finished soup goes great with bread and cheese, just like ordinary marmite.in general, you can usually get away with substituting marmite mixed with water, your favorite vegetables, and a little oil for beef broth. this can allow you to make great tasting vegetarian versions of all your favorite carnivorous soups and stews.  many marmite fans agree  the spread pairs deliciously with a wide variety of cheeses. sharp cheddar is an especially great choice   the salty, yeasty flavor of the marmite enhances the  sharpness  of the cheese, making for a bold flavored  but tasty  combination. try adding a few slices of cheese to standard marmite and butter toast for a satisfying breakfast.  though it may sound odd, marmite can be a tasty ingredient to include in glazes and sauces for meat dishes. used correctly, marmite can give the outer  crust  of roasted meats, poultry, and seafood a rich, distinct  umami   savory  flavor. try painting a light mixture of melted butter and marmite over a whole roasted chicken for a savory treat   you should only need a spoonful or two to cover it.   if you use marmite as a meat glaze, you may want to forego sprinkling salt from the salt shaker on your meat, especially if you need to be careful about your sodium intake. marmite has a very high salt content   it s more than 10  salt by mass   believe it or not, some people not only eat their spaghetti with marmite   they love it. if you re willing to experiment, try adding a half teaspoon of marmite to al dente noodles along with a small helping of olive oil  you may want to avoid using fine tomato sauces or cheeses to top your dish until you re positive that you enjoy it    note that some fans of this recipe describe the flavor as being similar to the british snack food  twiglets .  if you ve recently gained an appreciation for marmite and you re looking to expand your repertoire, try this marmite centered sampler dish, which works as a hearty meal on its own and scales easily for larger groups. start by boiling a few eggs in a pot of water until they re hard boiled. depending on the size of the eggs, this should take about eight to ten minutes.   run cold water over the eggs after they re done cooking. cooling them down halts the cooking process and prevents them from overcooking.  next, let s get our vegetables ready for the marmite. wash a bell pepper, a handful of cherry tomatoes, a cucumber, a carrot, and a few clumps of broccoli under running water. cut each into small bite size pieces. any shapes that look appealing are fine, but, for efficiency s sake, you ll probably want to julienne your bell pepper  cut it into skinny strips  and take thin circular slices from your cucumber.    finally, make a few golden brown slices of marmite s most well known companion dish. you can use white, wheat, or even specialty breads like sourdough and rye here   it s up to you  when the toast is ready, butter it. as noted above, butter and marmite pair quite well together.    arrange your vegetables, eggs, and toast in a circle around the outside of a large plate. open a jar of marmite and place it in the center of the dish.   don t forget to peel your hard boiled eggs. if you d like to use them to hold marmite like crackers, cut the eggs into quarters or eights to make skinny, curved slices.    using a butter knife, put small portions of marmite on each piece of vegetable or egg before biting in. you can eat the toast without marmite as a  chaser  to ready your mouth for the next bit piece of marmite, or, if you re bold, just spread a tiny dollop of marmite on each piece of bread.   if you want to, you can even dip your foods directly into the jar of marmite. be careful   it s easy to get more marmite than you intended this way   
query	207	 for the purposes of this example, we re using diet coke, but you can actually use any type of diet soda  as long as it contains aspartame .   warm soda causes better explosions, so avoid using cold refrigerated soda.for best results, purchase room temperature soda and then let it sit outside in the sun or in a pot full of hot  not boiling  water for a few hours before using it.    experiments have shown that while the original mint mentos will give you a longer explosion, mentos fruit will give you slightly shorter but more intense explosion.other experiments have shown that mint mentos are the better choice because the gum arabic found in the mint coating reduces surface tension and quickens the carbon dioxide s escape from the bottle, making for a more intense explosion.as the rocket is more of a fast acting affair, you might want to go for mint mentos. if you have the time and money to do so, why not try one bottle with mint mentos and one with fruit mentos, and then compare the results     you probably have this one lying around your house already, but if you don t, you should be able to buy a roll just about anywhere  hardware stores are a safe bet .    wearing goggles will not only protect your eyes from the soda mentos concoction, but also from any other debris  for example, the lid  that might fly out from the bottle once it hits the ground and explodes.    your rocket is likely to bounce around like crazy  make sure it has enough room to do that. if you re in a parking lot, make sure there are no cars nearby for at least a 50 foot radius, if not more.   if there s a field or empty lot nearby, go there to make your rocket. you don t want to risk doing damage to anyone s car or home, as it could cost you or your parents a lot of money to repair.    it s possible you ll get covered in the sticky diet coke mentos solution. wear clothes and shoes that you don t mind getting wet and sticky   preferably ones that are easy to wash.    bring your 2 liter bottle of diet coke, your pack of mentos, your masking tape, and your safety goggles to wherever you ve decided to build your rocket.    place the strips of tape on a flat surface, with their sticky sides facing up. do not allow them to stick together.    the more mentos you use, the better the explosion  however, you don t want to the mentos to dip too far into the diet coke otherwise the explosion may begin before you can screw the lid on the bottle.    they should look just as they did when they were still in their original packaging  stacked on top of one another like a roll of coins.    be sure to leave the sides of the mentos exposed.    you ll use this piece to attach the mentos to the bottle cap, so ensure that it s small enough to fit inside the cap.    take the 3 inch strip of sticky rolled tape that you ve just created and attach it to the top of the taped roll of mentos. this will create a  loaded  mentos cartridge that you can place inside the diet coke bottle.    put the cap on a flat surface, with its inside facing upwards. place the mentos cartridge, sticky tape side up, into the soda cap and press down to fasten it there.   be careful not to press too hard, as you don t want any mentos falling out of the cartridge     this step is optional. if you re worried about the mentos prematurely falling into the diet coke, you can secure the cartridge by running one more piece of masking tape around the entire roll, including the cap.    the cap should be securely on the bottle, but not closed too tightly. if it s closed too tightly, the cap might not come off when you throw the bottle, and the rocket won t work. as you twist the cap on, you ll also want to make sure that the mentos do not touch the diet coke yet.  if it seems like the mentos will touch the diet coke, you can either dump a small amount of diet coke out before screwing the cap on  redo your mentos cartridge to contain fewer mentos  or you can try your luck and screw the cap on as quickly as possible.    shake it so that the mentos fall into the diet coke, and then keep shaking. do this for at least a few seconds.    there are several different methods for  launching  your rocket    a popular and effective one is to throw the bottle high up into the air and let it fall on to the ground  preferably hard ground, like cement . this is the best method if you re worried about getting hit by the rocket, as you can throw it far away from you and even run in the opposite direction. another method is to throw the bottle at a side angle so that when it hits the ground, the ground knocks off its cap. yet another method is to throw the bottle at more of a 90 degree angle, cap first, on to the ground.    you can skip this step if your rocket works right away. if the rocket doesn t go off when you throw it, pick it up and try unscrewing the cap a little before throwing it again. just be careful not to unscrew the cap too far, otherwise you re likely to end up covered in diet coke.  when the bottle hits the ground, its cap should fly off and the diet coke mentos solution will shoot out of the bottle s opening. this should cause the bottle to fly high up into the air. depending on how you throw it, the bottle might also bounce around sporadically for several seconds.   side angle launches generally seem to cause the bottle to bounce low and skid along the ground. vertical launches  in which you throw the bottle straight up into the air and let it fall to the ground  tend to give the rocket more height as it shoots upward. if the bottle is still full of diet coke and mentos but it s stopped moving on the ground, you can try to launch it again to see if it has any more flight left in it.    once you ve finished your experiment, don t forget to pick up after yourself. clean up any bits of tape or mentos packaging that might have dropped to the ground as you built your rocket. and pick up the rocket  clean out the bottle and put it in the recycling bin  or bring it to the bottle depot .    the more mentos, the better the explosion. experiment with putting different amounts of mentos into the diet coke bottle to see what yields the best explosion.    studies have shown that mint and fruit mentos yield different explosions. try mixing them together in one cartridge and adding them to your diet coke bottle to see what sort of explosion they cause when they are mixed together.    fill an empty 4 liter milk jug with 4 liters  2 two liter bottles  of diet coke. leave enough room at the top to add at least an 8 mento cartridge.   as with the original rocket recipe, stick the mentos cartridge to the lid of the milk jug, fasten the lid, shake the container to release the mentos into the diet coke, then throw the jug high up into the air and let it hit the pavement hard.    get together with your friends and each make your own rocket. set up a flag or some other way of measuring height, and have a judge watch and name the winner.

query	210	 many pocket watches are heirlooms or keepsakes. if you have one of these, you have a distinctive statement that combines your family history with a design that probably can t be found for sale anywhere. consider using this watch as a functional, stylish accessory, the way it was meant to be used when it was created.   be careful. remember that heirloom watches are usually irreplaceable. be sure you re willing to take the risk of carrying it around with you before you decide to wear it.  properly securing the watch to a chain and hooking it onto a button or loop will help ensure that it does not become lost. this process is explained in greater detail below.   get it fixed. heirloom watches may not always work, or may work erratically. there is no reason you shouldn t take your watch in to a respected watch repair person if it isn t working perfectly. just ask around online first to find a repair shop that will take good care of your watch.  it is all right to send your watch to a repair person by mail if you are absolutely sure he or she will do a good job. broken or irregular pocket watches can still be worn as accessories, but you re likely to feel silly pulling them out of your pocket to  check the time.    clean it up. consider buying some metal polish and gently cleaning and polishing your heirloom pocket watch. many of them have tarnish and scuffing around the edges that will clean right out with a soft cloth, a safe polish, and a bit of elbow grease.  if your heirloom watch has etching or engraving on it, be sure to gently clean out the grooves as well. this will remove any grime built up in them and can sometimes make a dramatic difference in a watch s appearance.      if you don t have an heirloom pocket watch, you ll have to buy one for yourself. pocket watches come in many materials and finishes, so pick whichever look you like.   pick a metal. silver is often preferred by modern buyers, as it goes well with all color combinations and has a lustrous finish. other common materials include brass, gold, and steel. consider the level of detail. pocket watch designs range from simple, plain surfaces to ornately finished covers. watches with carved or engraved covers often have patterns, monograms or woodland scenes on them, and can add a unique look to your outfit. decide between new and used. each has its advantages.  new watches are likely to work for a long time without trouble, and represent the latest in pocket watch design. they are likely to be more expensive than used watches. used pocket watches offer a great variety of designs, motifs, and finishes. most used watches cost less than new ones, but prices can vary widely based on how collectible a given watch is.  don t buy a used pocket watch over the internet. there is no way to tell how well it will work or what its relative size is, in most cases.        the watch chain serves two purposes  first, it secures your pocket watch to your clothing so that you can t drop it on the ground or misplace it  second, it completes the look of the watch.   start with the standard type. ordinarily, you should pick a watch chain that has the same finish as your watch  thus, if your watch is steel, pick a steel chain, and so on.  chain weight and weave are up to each individual to decide. consider a fine, thin chain for dressing to the nines  lean towards a thick, durable chain for a look that will survive hard labor and adventuring.  be careful to pick a chain that is durable enough to keep your watch secure if you expect to wear it somewhere it might get hit or yanked.     add a strap or fob. if you plan to wear your pocket watch in a pants pocket instead of on your chest, consider attaching a leather strap or watch fob to it instead. they re generally sturdier than watch chains, and suggest a rugged, casual look.  you can also purchase a leather holder, which attaches to a belt loop and holds the watch outside your pants for a bolder statement.   mix up your collection. at the very least, a few different chain weights and lengths are recommended so that you can wear your watch on different outfits.  consider bucking tradition and mismatching your chain. like a fob, the different color will offset the finish of your pocket watch and make it pop.  be careful to pick combinations that look premeditated, rather than thrown together. your watch and chain should still look good no matter what.        pocket watches are an old fashioned accessory, but there are as many ways to wear them as there are ideas you can come up with. here are a few general looks you might consider    the classic  wear your pocket watch in a suit vest pocket for an old fashioned look. the watch chain should be hooked to a button on your vest, and the watch should go in the vest pocket with the watch face toward your body so that you can check the time as soon as you pull it out.  if you are right handed, the watch should go in your left vest pocket, and vice versa. this allows you to draw the watch while leaving your dominant hand free.   the casual  wear your pocket watch in a pants pocket for a bit of flash that will go unnoticed until you pull it out. hook the strap to a belt loop, and leave the watch face in inside your dominant front pocket as usual.  this look works better with a watch that has a larger face, since you won t be able to look at it as closely without unhooking it.   the laborer  pocket watches were never just the domain of the rich. although that is how we perceive them today, there was a time when anyone whose job required them to know the time carried a pocket watch. try an unusual retro look by wearing overalls with a pocket watch in the front bib pocket.  this look works better with a rugged, heavy chain, as it is a working man s outfit designed to take a lot of abuse. complete your ensemble with a loose fit collared work shirt, a newsboy cap, and chunky construction boots.   the theatrical  because a pocket watch is such a bold statement, it can be a useful accessory for themed outfits, such as costumes or ensembles that reflect your membership in a subculture.  consider buying an unusual fob or chain to offset the watch and make it a coordinated part of your outfit. since pocket watches are associated with wealth and conservatism, try wearing one in the jeans vest of a punk outfit to make a contrarian statement. pocket watches are a classy and impressive accessory for a steampunk ensemble. again, keep the watch hooked to a vest or shirt pocket to accentuate its old fashioned touch.      all but the newest pocket watches will run on time for between 26 and 30 hours per wind at most. even the latest models only last about 46 hours. regardless of what type of pocket watch you own, plan to give it a full wind every day.   the best time to wind your watch is in the morning. you can make it part of your daily routine, and the watch almost always gets wound at the same time each day, ensuring reliability.    a soft, dry chamois or microfiber cloth is suitable for gently lifting skin oil and dirt off of metal surfaces. use a tiny bit of metal cleaner if needed. clean your watch every time you are done wearing it.   if you wear your watch most days, clean it two to three times weekly, or as needed. don t forget to periodically wipe down the inside faces of the watch with your dry cloth.    use a polish designed for the metal of your watch to keep it shiny. apply a bit of polish, per the directions on the package, every few months or as needed.   if you need to remove tarnish, avoid products that require submersion in liquid. this can damage or loosen the delicate inner pieces of a pocket watch. use the same polish on your chain, assuming it s made of a similar material.    always make sure the watch fob or chain is securely attached to the watch at one end, and an item of clothing at the other.   attach your chain to an item of clothing you don t plan to remove. avoid jackets and other such layered coverings.

query	213	 the towel will keep the glass from sliding around and will catch any small fragments of glass that break off in the cutting process.    using your glass cutter, press down firmly and make one single score, from one edge to the other, where you d like the glass to break. it is very important to make only one score line in order to get a clean break.    the simplest way to do this is by holding the glass with one hand on each side of the line. make a quick snapping motion and the glass will separate along the score line.    continue scoring and breaking glass until you create your desired shapes. most stained glass projects use pieces that fit together like a puzzle. if you are looking for pattern ideas, you can purchase a book from your local craft store that gives examples of popular stained glass patterns.    set out your copper foil, liquid flux, and coil of solder. plug in your soldering iron and allow it to heat to its prime temperature. it is important to have everything set up prior to beginning the soldering process because quick timing is crucial in this project.    measure this by lining up the copper foil along the edge of the glass, leaving about 1 8  on each end. then cut the foil with your scissors. you can also buy strips of copper foil from craft stores    you should be able to easily strip away the paper backing from the foil, revealing the adhesive side.    try to position the edge of glass directly on the center of the copper foil.    it is helpful to use a pencil to push the small remaining edges of foil onto the face.    this is very important because it will smooth out the copper foil and create a stronger bond with the glass.   nan  the flux will encourage the metal in the copper and the solder to adhere more strongly.    leave a very thin gap  about 1 16   between the two pieces so the solder will be able to flow into the seam.    this will melt to form the bond between the two pieces of glass.    this can be reversed if you are left handed. choose whichever is more comfortable for you.    the best results are achieved by letting the melted solder drop into the seam between the pieces of glass.    it will immediately begin to melt the solder and the solder will drop into the seam.    move quickly enough so that the melted solder does not not bunch up in one area, but slow enough so that the entire seam gets coated with the bead of solder.    you should see a continuous line of solder along the intersection of the two pieces of glass. the glass is now strongly bonded together.    the more times you practice this process, the more comfortable you will feel and the cleaner your soldering lines will look.  
query	214	 both nimh and nicd batteries can be recharged over time, but you might want to think about investing in nimh batteries over nicd. nimh batteries use newer technology to store more charge and can also be fast, slow, or trickle charged.check the product in which you plan on using your batteries before purchasing your batteries. certain equipment may require either nimh or nicd to operate best.    these are one of the least expensive varieties of battery chargers available on the consumer market. a pre set shutoff timer will charge all batteries in the charger for a period of time and shut off once that time has elapsed.these chargers are less precise than smart chargers, which can lead to under  and over charging. take this into account when buying a timer charger  over charged batteries can be ruined and cost you more money.    smart chargers can be more expensive initially, but these are equipped with sensors that detect missing voltage in your batteries. this way, your charger will continue to charge your battery until it has reached full charge, saving you the cost of batteries ruined from over charging.  the rechargeable batteries you bought earlier will also help you to decide which charger you invest in. some chargers are intended for only nimh or nicd batteries, though some universal chargers are available.most aa and aaa battery chargers can be used for both nimh and nicd batteries, though you should always consult your manual to be certain.    you should never attempt to charge a battery that isn t intended to be rechargeable. this can cause a dangerous explosion from hydrogen gas buildup and may ruin your battery or charger as well.check the manual that came with your charger to know the recommended safety procedure for your charger, but generally you should    keep your charger and batteries away from fire or intense heat. do not charge your batteries around or on top of flammable materials, including flammable gases, like gasoline vapor. insert your batteries into your charger firmly before plugging in your charger. prevent your charger from being exposed to rain, snow, water, and oil.  these kind of batteries experience what is called the  memory effect.  this means that if you charge your battery before it is completely dead, your battery will remember the smaller capacity as its full potential, which will hurt your battery life.  some batteries may have a specific amperage for best results. this may include charge times for  fast  or  standard  charge speeds. always follow manufacturer recommendations for best results and safest use.   as an example, you may see that your battery might have  std. charge  60ma 14   16 hrs  written on it. this battery would charge best at 60 milliamps for a minimum of 14 hours.    some chargers come with an interface or a timer that you might need to set. you may be able to set the rate of charge  fast, quick, normal, slow, trickle  as a function of capacity. this is represented by a fraction of the capacity, represented by the format  c   .you should also set your timer with respect to your charge rate  c rate .   for example, charging your battery at c 10 will charge 10  of your batteries full capacity per hour, charging your battery fully in a little over 10 hours, depending on efficiency of your charger. many manufacturers recommend slower rates of charging. faster charging will result in less efficient charging.    this should be done before you plug your charger into an electrical outlet, unless otherwise indicated by your charger manual. once you feel the batteries click into place, you can plug in your charger and begin charging.    once your timer is up or the display on your charger indicates that all batteries are fully charged, as is usually the case with smart chargers, unplug your charger and remove the batteries. if you find that your batteries are difficult to remove, use a gentle tapping motion until one is jarred free.    most basic car battery chargers will charge at a rate of about 2 amps per hour with most batteries being rated at 48 amp hours. this means that your charger will take 24 hours to fully charge the 48 total amp hours if your battery is completely flat.fast charging, while tempting, should be considered carefully. the heat created from fast charging can cause battery plates to buckle, or can cause other damage to your battery.  these are relatively inexpensive when compared with the cost of replacing flat batteries over time and can be purchased at most automotive or hardware stores. be sure you read all information provided with your charger so you have a thorough understanding of safe operating procedure.  if your battery is flat dead, this step may be unnecessary. however, if you are unsure or want to take extra measures to protect your battery from overcharging, you should check the remaining charge with a hydrometer. a hydrometer is a turkey baster shaped tool that measures electrical capacity as a function of specific gravity by carefully removing the battery cell cover as directed by your battery instructions. squeezing the hydrometer bulb to force out air and maintaining this position. inserting the nozzle of your hydrometer into the battery cell. taking the reading of the electrolyte fluid drawing from the cell into your hydrometer. comparing your reading to the normal reading for fully charged batteries, usually between 1.270 and 1.290. the reading for depleted batteries ranges from 1.130 to lower values.  be sure your charger is off before connecting it to your battery.remove any cap covers from the positive and negative terminals of your battery. your car battery charger should have clamps at the end of positive     and negative     leads. clamp these to the corresponding terminal on your battery.the leads, clamps, and covers are almost always color coded to ensure the correct connection. for most vehicles, red will indicate positive and black negative.  now that the leads are connected, you can turn on your charger and begin charging your battery. most car battery chargers come with an ammeter which reads the amperage used to charge the battery. verify the reading on this to ensure you are not charging at too high of an amperage.  the starter for most car engines will have enough energy to operate after about 10   15 minutes of charging. once your starter can run, you can start your engine and allow the car to idle. this will allow your alternator to restore charge to your car without the sustained use of your charger.  once you have charged your battery sufficiently for your purposes, you can turn off the charger. with the charger off, you should have no difficulty removing the clamps from the positive and negative terminals of your battery.remember to reattach the caps that cover the terminal ends of your battery. corrosion to the terminal can ruin a good battery.    over time, dirt, grime, or corrosion may have degraded the connections of your charger s charging plates or clamps. if you notice a white film, rust, or other signs of dirtiness, you may want to clean the connections with a manual recommended cleaning product.   consumer battery charger connections can sometimes be cleaned with alcohol, but you should consult your manual to prevent accidental damage to your charger. car battery chargers can be cleaned with a solution of baking soda and water.  sometimes a battery will sit in its charging slot slightly askew, which can prevent your battery from charging. make sure the positive and negative ends of your battery are completely connected to your charger connectors.    some chargers, especially the high amperage charger you may use on your car, can draw too much current and blow an electrical fuse. this can even happen in outlets equipped with a wall fuse. check your fuse box or wall fuse to make sure your charger is receiving power, and reset any blown

during the aging process. designating a separate dry aging refrigerator or freezer is the easiest way of doing this.   meat will spoil above 40 f  4 c  but will freeze below 32 f  0 c . the ideal temperature for aging is 36 f  2.2 c  throughout the entire aging process.using your everyday refrigerator is not recommended. the more you open and close your refrigerator freezer, the more the temperature and humidity will change. you might use a small, temperature adjustable  dorm  refrigerator or a storage freezer for your dry aging.    meats will absorb other strong flavors and odors. items like cheese, fish, and garlic will likely influence the taste of your meat while it ages. a thorough cleaning before dry aging will help protect the natural flavor profile of your meat.   the best way to ensure that there are no subtle contaminants in your refrigerator freezer is to defrost and clean your freezer with a suitable general purpose cleaner. if smells linger after cleaning,

thermometer as commercial grade ones. in some cases, your refrigerator might not have an internal temperature gauge, and you ll need to buy one so you ensure a consistent temperature throughout the aging process.   a normal thermometer might not stand up to the cold temperatures as well as a specifically intended cold temperature freezer thermometer. these will likely be available at your local hardware store. you might want to choose a thermometer that has a humidity gauge, as well. for consistent results, a humidity of 60  should be maintained, though many at home dry agers have found a wider range has little effect on the end product.  air circulation is important for the dry aging process. limited circulation can lead to your meat failing to dehydrate at the optimal level. adding a small desk fan to the inside of your meat refrigerator freezer can solve this problem.   you may need to cut a notch in the seal of your refrigerator freezer for the cord of the fan. after fitting the cord into the notch, you may want to pack any open gaps with some kind of insulation.  you ll also want your meat to be a kind that uses quick cooking methods, like new york strips, rib steak, and porterhouse cuts. small cuts of meat should be avoided, as the loss of moisture during aging can make these seem too small to be the main course of a meal. larger pieces, on the other hand, can be trimmed down.   individually cut steaks will not work for the dry aging process. you ll need a whole cut, like rib sections 103, 107, 109a, and 109 export. boneless beef rib or loin roast rated as  choice  or  prime  are also good options for your dry aging.when buying one of these cuts from a butcher, you should ask him not to trim your cut of meat at all. do not trim your meat before storing it for dry aging.  the color is directly related to the tenderness of the beef and how long the aging process should last. if your beef is darker, it does not need to be aged more than a week. beef that is lighter in color should be aged more than 7 days, but no longer than 30 days.if you have difficulty discerning the color of your meat at a glance, you might want to compare it side by side with a fresh cut of meat.    remove your meat from the packaging it came wrapped in. then, with cool water, thoroughly rinse all parts of the meat exposed to the open air. after you have finished rinsing, pat the meat dry with paper towels. once your meat is dry, it s ready to be wrapped.  the cheesecloth will form a protective barrier around your meat and will prevent the meat from dehydrating too suddenly. wrap your cut of meat loosely in the cheesecloth so that all exposed portions of it are covered by three layers of the cloth.   you can also protect your meat from sudden dehydration with a triple thick layer of paper towel.  you can place your meat directly onto a clean rack of your refrigerator freezer, or you can first put your meat onto a suitable tray, like a rimmed baking sheet. set your refrigerator fan to low, and double check the temperature to make sure it is at 36 f  2.2 c .  as the meat ages, sometimes your covering can get stuck to the meat, leaving fibers behind. after the first day, remove your cheesecloth or paper towel covering, and then loosely rewrap the meat using the same covering.   as your paper cheesecloth paper towel will have already absorbed some moisture from the meat, it ll be less likely to leave fibers behind when the aging process is finished.  you ll want to dry age your meat for the length of time you determined it would need from its coloring. you may not notice a difference in your meat when aging it for periods of time shorter than two weeks.it s common for your meat to start developing an unpleasant smell during the aging process. this could affect other meat in your fridge, which is another reason why it s good to use a separate, designated fridge freezer for aging.  the outer parts of the meat will be the most dehydrated. these parts won t likely be edible, but under this crusty surface you ll find the tender, flavorful meat that aged beef is known for. use a sharp knife to shave free the outer layer.if you notice any fat that has dried, shave this from your meat as well. good fat that still looks moist, however, should be kept.    now that the aging is complete, you can cut your meat into portions, like steaks. shortly after that, your meat should be eaten to prevent an unhealthy amount of post aging breakdown.   if you are unable to eat the meat the day it is done aging, you can leave it in a refrigerator for 1 to 2 days without damaging the meat.
