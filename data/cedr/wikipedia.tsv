query	30	shakespeare s plays have the reputation of being among the greatest in the english language and in western literature. traditionally  the plays are divided into the genres of tragedy  history  and comedy  they have been translated into every major living language  in addition to being continually performed all around the world. many of his plays appeared in print as a series of quartos  but approximately half of them remained unpublished until 1623  when the posthumous first folio was published. the traditional division of his plays into tragedies  comedies  and histories follows the categories used in the first folio. however  modern criticism has labeled some of these plays  problem plays  that elude easy categorisation  or perhaps purposely break generic conventions  and has introduced the term romances for what scholars believe to be his later comedies. when shakespeare first arrived in london in the late 1570s or early 1580s  dramatists writing for london s new commercial playhouses  such as the curtain  were combining two strands of dramatic tradition into a new and distinctively elizabethan synthesis. previously  the most common forms of popular english theatre were the tudor morality plays. these plays  celebrating piety generally  use personified moral attributes to urge or instruct the protagonist to choose the virtuous life over evil. the characters and plot situations are largely symbolic rather than realistic. as a child  shakespeare would likely have seen this type of play  along with  perhaps  mystery plays and miracle plays .the other strand of dramatic tradition was classical aesthetic theory. this theory was derived ultimately from aristotle  in renaissance england  however  the theory was better known through its roman interpreters and practitioners. at the universities  plays were staged in a more academic form as roman closet dramas. these plays  usually performed in latin  adhered to classical ideas of unity and decorum  but they were also more static  valuing lengthy speeches over physical action. shakespeare would have learned this theory at grammar school  where plautus and especially terence were key parts of the curriculum and were taught in editions with lengthy theoretical introductions.

query	58	the chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on saturday 26 april 1986  at the no. 4 nuclear reactor in the chernobyl nuclear power plant  near the city of pripyat in the north of the ukrainian ssr. it is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history and is one of only two nuclear energy disasters rated at seven the maximum severity on the international nuclear event scale  the other being the 2011 fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster in japan. the accident started during a safety test on an rbmk type nuclear reactor  which was commonly used throughout the soviet union. the test was a simulation of an electrical power outage to aid the development of a safety procedure for maintaining cooling water circulation until the back up generators could provide power   there is a time gap between the moment of power outage and the moment at which the back up generators reach full power. this operating gap was about one minute and had been identified as a potential safety problem that could cause the nuclear reactor core to overheat. three such tests had been conducted since 1982  but they had failed to provide a solution. on this fourth attempt  the test was delayed by 10 hours  so an unprepared operating shift had to perform it. during a gradual decrease of reactor power that was done in preparation for the test  the power unexpectedly dropped to a near zero level at one moment. the operators were able to partially restore power  but this put the reactor in a highly unstable condition. the risks were not made evident in the operating instructions  despite a similar accident occurring years before  and the test proceeded even though the power was still lower than prescribed. upon test completion  the operators triggered a reactor shutdown  but a combination of unstable conditions and reactor design flaws caused an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction instead.a large amount of energy was suddenly released  vapourising superheated cooling water and rupturing the reactor core in a highly destructive steam explosion. this was immediately followed by an open air reactor core fire that released considerable airborne radioactive contamination for about nine days that precipitated onto parts of the ussr and western europe  before being finally contained on 4 may 1986. the fire gradually released about the same amount of contamination as the initial explosion.  as a result of rising ambient radiation levels off site  a 10 kilometre  6.2 mi  radius exclusion zone was created 36 hours after the accident. about 49 000 people were evacuated from the area  primarily from pripyat. the exclusion zone was later increased to 30 kilometres  19 mi  radius when a further 68 000 people were evacuated from the wider area.the reactor explosion killed two of the reactor operating staff. in the emergency response that followed  134 firemen and station staff were hospitalized with acute radiation syndrome due to absorbing high doses of ionizing radiation. of these 134 people  28 died in the days to months afterward and approximately 14 suspected radiation induced cancer deaths followed within the next 10 years. among the wider population  an excess of 15 childhood thyroid cancer deaths were documented as of 2011. the united nations scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation  unscear  has  at multiple times  reviewed all the published research on the incident and found that at present  fewer than 100 documented deaths are likely to be attributable to increased exposure to radiation. determining the total eventual number of exposure related deaths is uncertain based on the linear no threshold model  a contested statistical model  which has also been used in estimates of low level radon and air pollution exposure. model predictions with the greatest confidence values of the eventual total death toll in the decades ahead from chernobyl releases vary  from 4 000 fatalities when solely assessing the three most contaminated former soviet states  to about 9 000 to 16 000 fatalities when assessing the total continent of europe.to reduce the spread of radioactive contamination from the wreckage and protect it from weathering  the protective chernobyl nuclear power plant sarcophagus was built by december 1986. it also provided radiological protection for the crews of the undamaged reactors at the site  which continued operating. due to the continued deterioration of the sarcophagus  it was further enclosed in 2017 by the chernobyl new safe confinement  a larger enclosure that allows the removal of both the sarcophagus and the reactor debris  while containing the radioactive hazard. nuclear clean up is scheduled for completion in 2065. the chernobyl disaster is considered the worst nuclear power plant accident in history  both in terms of cost and casualties. the initial emergency response  together with later decontamination of the environment  ultimately involved more than 500 000 personnel and cost an estimated 18 billion soviet rubles roughly us 68 billion in 2019  adjusted for inflation. the accident resulted in safety upgrades on all remaining soviet designed rbmk reactors  of which 10 continue to be operational as of 2019.
query	59	christmas dinner is a meal traditionally eaten at christmas. this meal can take place any time from the evening of christmas eve to the evening of christmas day itself. the meals are often particularly rich and substantial  in the tradition of the christian feast day celebration  and form a significant part of gatherings held to celebrate the arrival of christmastide. in many cases  there is a ritual element to the meal related to the religious celebration  such as the praying of grace. the actual meal consumed varies in different parts of the world with regional cuisines and local traditions. in many parts of the world  particularly former british colonies  the meal shares some connection with the english christmas dinner involving roasted meats and pudding of some description. the christmas pudding and christmas cake evolved from this tradition. in countries without a lengthy christian tradition  such as japan  the christmas meal may be more heavily influenced by popular culture.

query	70	world war i  often abbreviated as wwi or ww1   also known as the first world war or the great war  was a global war originating in europe that lasted from 28 july 1914 to 11 november 1918. contemporaneously described as  the war to end all wars   it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel  including 60 million europeans  making it one of the largest wars in history. it is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history  with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war  while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide.on 28 june 1914  gavrilo princip  a bosnian serb yugoslav nationalist  assassinated the austro hungarian heir archduke franz ferdinand in sarajevo  leading to the july crisis. in response  on 23 july  austria hungary issued an ultimatum to serbia. serbia s reply failed to satisfy the austrians  and the two moved to a war footing. a network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the balkans to one involving most of europe. by july 1914  the great powers of europe were divided into two coalitions  the triple entente consisting of france  russia  and britain and the triple alliance of germany  austria hungary  and italy  the triple alliance was only defensive in nature  allowing italy to stay out of the war until april 1915  when it joined the allied powers after its relations with austria hungary deteriorated . russia felt it necessary to back serbia and  after austria hungary shelled the serbian capital of belgrade on the 28 july  approved partial mobilisation. full russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 july  on the 31st  austria hungary and germany did the same  while germany demanded russia demobilise within twelve hours. when russia failed to comply  germany declared war on russia on 1 august in support of austria hungary  with austria hungary following suit on 6 august  france ordered full mobilisation in support of russia on 2 august.german strategy for a war on two fronts against france and russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the west to defeat france within six weeks  then shift forces to the east before russia could fully mobilise  this was later known as the schlieffen plan. on 2 august  germany demanded free passage through belgium  an essential element in achieving a quick victory over france. when this was refused  german forces invaded belgium on 3 august and declared war on france the same day  the belgian government invoked the 1839 treaty of london and in compliance with its obligations under this  britain declared war on germany on 4 august. on 12 august  britain and france also declared war on austria hungary  on the 23 august  japan sided with britain  seizing german possessions in china and the pacific. in november 1914  the ottoman empire entered the war on the side of the central powers  opening fronts in the caucasus  mesopotamia  and the sinai peninsula. the war was fought in and drew upon each power s colonial empire as well  spreading the conflict to africa and across the globe. the entente and its allies would eventually become known as the allied powers  while the grouping of austria hungary  germany and their allies would become known as the central powers. the german advance into france was halted at the battle of the marne and by the end of 1914  the western front settled into a battle of attrition  marked by a long series of trench lines that changed little until 1917  the eastern front  by contrast  was marked by much greater exchanges of territory . in 1915  italy joined the allied powers and opened a front in the alps. bulgaria joined the central powers in 1915 and greece joined the allies in 1917  expanding the war in the balkans. the united states initially remained neutral  though even while neutral it became an important supplier of war materiel to the allies. eventually  after the sinking of american merchant ships by german submarines  the declaration by germany that its navy would resume unrestricted attacks on neutral shipping  and the revelation that germany was trying to incite mexico to make war on the united states  the u.s. declared war on germany on 6 april 1917. trained american forces would not begin arriving at the front in large numbers until mid 1918  but ultimately the american expeditionary force would reach some two million troops.though serbia was defeated in 1915  and romania joined the allied powers in 1916 only to be defeated in 1917  none of the great powers were knocked out of the war until 1918. the 1917 february revolution in russia replaced the tsarist autocracy with the provisional government  but continuing discontent with the cost of the war led to the october revolution  the creation of the soviet socialist republic  and the signing of the treaty of brest litovsk by the new government in march 1918  ending russia s involvement in the war. this allowed the transfer of large numbers of german troops from the east to the western front  resulting in the german march 1918 offensive. this offensive was initially successful  but failed to score a decisive victory and exhausted the last of the german reserves. the allies rallied and drove the germans back in their hundred days offensive  a continual series of attacks to which the germans had no reply. bulgaria was the first central power to sign an armistice the armistice of salonica on 29 september 1918. on 30 october  the ottoman empire capitulated  signing the armistice of mudros. on 4 november  the austro hungarian empire agreed to the armistice of villa giusti. with its allies defeated  revolution at home  and the military no longer willing to fight  kaiser wilhelm abdicated on 9 november and germany signed an armistice on 11 november 1918  effectively ending the war. world war i was a significant turning point in the political  cultural  economic  and social climate of the world. it is considered to mark the end of the second industrial revolution and the pax britannica. the war and its immediate aftermath sparked numerous revolutions and uprisings. the big four  britain  france  the united states  and italy  imposed their terms on the defeated powers in a series of treaties agreed at the 1919 paris peace conference  the most well known being the german peace treaty the treaty of versailles. ultimately  as a result of the war the austro hungarian  german  ottoman  and russian empires ceased to exist  with numerous new states created from their remains. however  despite the conclusive allied victory  and the creation of the league of nations during the peace conference  intended to prevent future wars   a second world war would follow just over twenty years later.

query	75	scheme is a programming language that supports multiple paradigms  including functional and imperative programming. it is one of the three main dialects of lisp  alongside common lisp and clojure. unlike common lisp  scheme follows a minimalist design philosophy  specifying a small standard core with powerful tools for language extension. scheme was created during the 1970s at the mit ai lab and released by its developers  guy l. steele and gerald jay sussman  via a series of memos now known as the lambda papers. it was the first dialect of lisp to choose lexical scope and the first to require implementations to perform tail call optimization  giving stronger support for functional programming and associated techniques such as recursive algorithms. it was also one of the first programming languages to support first class continuations.  it had a significant influence on the effort that led to the development of common lisp.the scheme language is standardized in the official ieee standard and a de facto standard called the revisedn report on the algorithmic language scheme  rnrs . the most widely implemented standard is r5rs  1998   a new standard  r6rs  was ratified in 2007. scheme has a diverse user base due to its compactness and elegance  but its minimalist philosophy has also caused wide divergence between practical implementations  so much that the scheme steering committee calls it  the world s most unportable programming language  and  a family of dialects  rather than a single language.
query	76	liability insurance  also called third party insurance  is a part of the general insurance system of risk financing to protect the purchaser  the  insured   from the risks of liabilities imposed by lawsuits and similar claims and protects the insured if the purchaser is sued for claims that come within the coverage of the insurance policy.  originally  individual companies that faced a common peril formed a group and created a self help fund out of which to pay compensation should any member incur loss  in other words  a mutual insurance arrangement . the modern system relies on dedicated carriers  usually for profit  to offer protection against specified perils in consideration of a premium.  liability insurance is designed to offer specific protection against third party insurance claims  i.e.  payment is not typically made to the insured  but rather to someone suffering loss who is not a party to the insurance contract. in general  damage caused intentionally as well as contractual liability are not covered under liability insurance policies. when a claim is made  the insurance carrier has the duty  and right  to defend the insured.  the legal costs of a defence normally do not affect policy limits unless the policy expressly states otherwise  this default rule is useful because defence costs tend to soar when cases go to trial. in many cases  the defense portion of the policy is actually more valuable than the insurance  as in complicated cases  the cost of defending the case might be more than the amount being claimed  especially in so called  nuisance  cases where the insured must be defended even though no liability is ever brought to trial.

query	99	the invention of television was the work of many individuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. the first practical transmissions of moving images over a radio system used mechanical rotating perforated disks to scan a scene into a time varying signal that could be reconstructed at a receiver back into an approximation of the original image. development of television was interrupted by the second world war.  after the end of the war  all electronic methods of scanning and displaying images became standard. several different standards for addition of color to transmitted images were developed  with different regions using technically incompatible signal standards.  television broadcasting expanded rapidly after world war ii  becoming an important mass medium for advertising  propaganda  and entertainment. television broadcasts can be distributed over the air by vhf and uhf radio signals from terrestrial transmitting stations  by microwave band signals from earth orbiting satellites  or by wired transmission to individual consumers by cable tv. many countries have moved away from the original analog radio transmission methods and now use digital television standards  providing additional operating features and conserving radio spectrum bandwidth for more profitable uses. television programming can also be distributed over the internet.  television broadcasting may be funded by advertising revenue  by private or governmental organizations prepared to underwrite the cost  or in some countries  by television license fees paid by owners of receivers. some services  especially carried by cable or satellite  are paid by subscriptions.  television broadcasting is supported by continuing technical developments such as long haul microwave networks  which allow distribution of programming over a wide geographic area. video recording methods allow programming to be edited and replayed for later use. three dimensional television has been used commercially but has not received wide consumer acceptance owing to the limitations of display methods.
query	100	acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine and a key component of traditional chinese medicine  tcm  in which thin needles are inserted into the body. acupuncture is a pseudoscience because the theories and practices of tcm are not based on scientific knowledge  and it has been characterized as quackery. there is a range of acupuncture variants which originated in different philosophies  and techniques vary depending on the country in which it is performed. it is most often used to attempt pain relief  though acupuncturists say that it can also be used for a wide range of other conditions. acupuncture is generally used only in combination with other forms of treatment.the conclusions of numerous trials and systematic reviews of acupuncture are inconsistent  which suggests that it is not effective. an overview of cochrane reviews found that acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions. a systematic review conducted by medical scientists at the universities of exeter and plymouth found little evidence of acupuncture s effectiveness in treating pain. overall  the evidence suggests that short term treatment with acupuncture does not produce long term benefits. some research results suggest that acupuncture can alleviate some forms of pain  though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture s apparent effects are not caused by the treatment itself. a systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias. one meta analysis found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was cost effective as an adjunct to standard care  while a separate systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain.acupuncture is generally safe when done by appropriately trained practitioners using clean needle technique and single use needles. when properly delivered  it has a low rate of mostly minor adverse effects. accidents and infections do occur  though  and are associated with neglect on the part of the practitioner  particularly in the application of sterile techniques. a review conducted in 2013 stated that reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the preceding decade. the most frequently reported adverse events were pneumothorax and infections. since serious adverse events continue to be reported  it is recommended that acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the risk.scientific investigation has not found any histological or physiological evidence for traditional chinese concepts such as qi  meridians  and acupuncture points  and many modern practitioners no longer support the existence of life force energy  qi  or meridians  which was a major part of early belief systems. acupuncture is believed to have originated around 100 bc in china  around the time the yellow emperor s classic of internal medicine  huangdi neijing  was published  though some experts suggest it could have been practiced earlier. over time  conflicting claims and belief systems emerged about the effect of lunar  celestial and earthly cycles  yin and yang energies  and a body s  rhythm  on the effectiveness of treatment. acupuncture fluctuated in popularity in china due to changes in the country s political leadership and the preferential use of rationalism or western medicine. acupuncture spread first to korea in the 6th century ad  then to japan through medical missionaries  and then to europe  beginning with france. in the 20th century  as it spread to the united states and western countries  spiritual elements of acupuncture that conflicted with western beliefs were sometimes abandoned in favor of simply tapping needles into acupuncture points.

query	103	the apgar score is a method to quickly summarize the health of newborn children against infant mortality. virginia apgar  an anesthesiologist at newyork presbyterian hospital  developed the score in 1952 to quantify the effects of obstetric anesthesia on babies.the apgar score is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria on a scale from zero to two  then summing up the five values thus obtained. the resulting score ranges from zero to 10. the five criteria are summarized using words chosen to form a backronym  appearance  pulse  grimace  activity  respiration .  
query	104	asthma is a common long term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. it is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms  reversible airflow obstruction  and easily triggered bronchospasms. symptoms include episodes of wheezing  coughing  chest tightness  and shortness of breath. these may occur a few times a day or a few times per week. depending on the person  asthma symptoms may become worse at night or with exercise.asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms  response to therapy over time  and spirometry lung function testing. asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms  forced expiratory volume in one second  fev1   and peak expiratory flow rate. it may also be classified as atopic or non atopic  where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction.there is no cure for asthma. symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers  such as allergens and irritants  and by the use of inhaled corticosteroids. long acting beta agonists  laba  or antileukotriene agents may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled. treatment of rapidly worsening symptoms is usually with an inhaled short acting beta 2 agonist such as salbutamol and corticosteroids taken by mouth. in very severe cases  intravenous corticosteroids  magnesium sulfate  and hospitalization may be required.in 2015  358 million people globally had asthma  up from 183 million in 1990. it caused about 397 100 deaths in 2015  most of which occurred in the developing world. asthma often begins in childhood  and the rates have increased significantly since the 1960s. asthma was recognized as early as ancient egypt. the word  asthma  is from the greek         sthma  which means  panting .
query	105	the axilla  also  armpit  underarm  or oxter  is the area on the human body directly under the joint where the arm connects to the shoulder. it also contains many sweat glands. in humans  the formation of body odor happens mostly in the armpit. these odorant substances have been suggested by some to serve as pheromones which play a role related to mating  however  this is a controversial topic within the scientific community. the underarm regions seem more important than the genital region for body odor which may be related to human bipedalism.
query	106	ayurveda    is a hindu system of medicine with historical roots in the indian subcontinent. globalized and modernized practices derived from ayurveda traditions are a type of alternative medicine. in countries beyond india  ayurvedic therapies and practices have been integrated in general wellness applications and in some cases in medical use.the main classical ayurveda texts begin with accounts of the transmission of medical knowledge from the gods to sages  and then to human physicians.  in sushruta samhita  sushruta s compendium   sushruta wrote that dhanvantari  hindu god of ayurveda  incarnated himself as a king of varanasi and taught medicine to a group of physicians  including sushruta. ayurveda therapies have varied and evolved over more than two millennia.  therapies are typically based on complex herbal compounds  minerals and metal substances  perhaps under the influence of early indian alchemy or rasa shastra . ancient ayurveda texts also taught surgical techniques  including rhinoplasty  kidney stone extractions  sutures  and the extraction of foreign objects.although laboratory experiments suggest it is possible that some substances used in ayurveda might be developed into effective treatments  there is no scientific evidence that any are effective as currently practiced. ayurveda medicine is pseudoscientific. other researchers consider it a protoscience  or trans science system instead. in a 2008 study  close to 21  of ayurveda u.s. and indian manufactured patent medicines sold through the internet were found to contain toxic levels of heavy metals  specifically lead  mercury  and arsenic. the public health implications of such metallic contaminants in india are unknown.some scholars assert that ayurveda originated in prehistoric times  and that some of the concepts of ayurveda have existed from the time of the indus valley civilization or even earlier. ayurveda developed significantly during the vedic period and later some of the non vedic systems such as buddhism and jainism also developed medical concepts and practices that appear in the classical ayurveda texts. do a balance is emphasized  and suppressing natural urges is considered unhealthy and claimed to lead to illness. ayurveda treatises describe three elemental do as viz. v ta  pitta and kapha  and state that equality  skt. s myatva  of the do as results in health  while inequality  vi amatva  results in disease. ayurveda treatises divide medicine into eight canonical components. ayurveda practitioners had developed various medicinal preparations and surgical procedures from at least the beginning of the common era.
query	107	back pain  also known as backache  is pain felt in the back. the back is divided into neck pain  cervical   middle back pain  thoracic   lower back pain  lumbar  or coccydynia  tailbone or sacral pain  based on the segment affected. the lumbar area is the most common area affected. episodes of back pain may be acute  sub acute  or chronic depending on the duration. the pain may be characterized as a dull ache  shooting or piercing pain  or a burning sensation. discomfort can radiate into the arms and hands as well as the legs or feet  and may include numbness  or weakness in the legs and arms. the majority of back pain is nonspecific with no identifiable causes. common underlying mechanisms include degenerative or traumatic changes to the discs and facets joints  which can then cause secondary pain in the muscles  and  nerves  and referred pain to the bones  joints and extremities. diseases and inflammation of the gallbladder  pancreas  aorta  and kidneys may also cause referred pain in the back. tumors of the vertebrae  neural tissues and adjacent structures can also manifest as back pain. back pain is common  with about nine out of ten adults experiencing it at some point in their life  and five out of ten working adults having it every year. some estimate up to 95  of people will experience back pain at some point in their lifetime. it is the most common cause of chronic pain  and is a major contributor of missed work and disability. for most individuals  back pain is self limited. in most cases of herniated disks and stenosis  rest  injections or surgery have similar general pain resolution outcomes on average after one year. in the united states  acute low back pain is the fifth most common reason for physician visits and causes 40  of missed days off work. additionally  it is the single leading cause of disability worldwide.
query	108	brian  sometimes spelled bryan in english  is a male given name of irish and breton origin  as well as a surname of occitan origin. it is common in the english speaking world. it is possible that the name is derived from an old celtic word meaning  high  or  noble . for example  the element bre means  hill   which could be transferred to mean  eminence  or  exalted one . the name is quite popular in ireland  on account of brian boru  a 10th century high king of ireland. the name was also quite popular in east anglia during the middle ages. this is because the name was introduced to england by bretons following the norman conquest. bretons also settled in ireland along with the normans in the 12th century  and  their  name was mingled with the  irish  version. also  in the north west of england  the  irish  name was introduced by scandinavian settlers from ireland. within the gaelic speaking areas of scotland  the name was at first only used by professional families of irish origin. it was the fourth most popular male name in england and wales in 1934  but a sharp decline followed over the remainder of the 20th century and by 1994 it had fallen out of the top 100. it retained its popularity in the united states for longer  its most popular period there was from 1968 1979 when it consistently ranked between eighth and tenth. the name has become increasingly popular in south america   particularly argentina and uruguay since the early 1990s. the surname brian is sometimes an english and irish variant spelling of the surname bryan. the english and french surname brian is sometimes derived from the personal celtic personal name shown above. the surname brian can also sometimes be a french surname  derived from the old occitan word brian  meaning  maggot  and used as a nickname.variants of the name include briant  brien  bran  brion  bryan  bryant  brj nn  in icelandic  and bryon. variant spellings such as  brien  are sometimes used as female given names  especially among members of the irish diaspora.  
query	109	carpal tunnel syndrome  cts  is a medical condition due to compression of the median nerve as it travels through the wrist at the carpal tunnel. the main symptoms are pain  numbness and tingling in the thumb  index finger  middle finger and the thumb side of the ring finger. symptoms typically start gradually and during the night. pain may extend up the arm. weak grip strength may occur  and after a long period of time the muscles at the base of the thumb may waste away. in more than half of cases  both sides are affected.risk factors include obesity  repetitive wrist work  pregnancy  genetics  and rheumatoid arthritis. there is tentative evidence that hypothyroidism increases the risk. diabetes mellitus is weakly associated with cts. the use of birth control pills does not affect the risk. types of work that are associated include computer work  work with vibrating tools and work that requires a strong grip. diagnosis is suspected based on signs  symptoms and specific physical tests and may be confirmed with electrodiagnostic tests. if muscle wasting at the base of the thumb is present  the diagnosis is likely.being physically active can decrease the risk of developing cts. symptoms can be improved by wearing a wrist splint or with corticosteroid injections. taking nsaids or gabapentin does not appear to be useful. surgery to cut the transverse carpal ligament is effective with better results at a year compared to non surgical options. further splinting after surgery is not needed. evidence does not support magnet therapy.about 5  of people in the united states have carpal tunnel syndrome. it usually begins in adulthood  and women are more commonly affected than men. up to 33  of people may improve without specific treatment over approximately a year. carpal tunnel syndrome was first fully described after world war ii.
query	110	chromosomal crossover  or crossing over  is the exchange of genetic material between two homologous chromosomes non sister chromatids that results in recombinant chromosomes during sexual reproduction. it is one of the final phases of genetic recombination  which occurs in the pachytene stage of prophase i of meiosis during a process called synapsis. synapsis begins before the synaptonemal complex develops and is not completed until near the end of prophase i. crossover usually occurs when matching regions on matching chromosomes break and then reconnect to the other chromosome. crossing over was described  in theory  by thomas hunt morgan. he relied on the discovery of frans alfons janssens who described the phenomenon in 1909 and had called it  chiasmatypie . the term chiasma is linked  if not identical  to chromosomal crossover. morgan immediately saw the great importance of janssens  cytological interpretation of chiasmata to the experimental results of his research on the heredity of drosophila. the physical basis of crossing over was first demonstrated by harriet creighton and barbara mcclintock in 1931.the linked frequency of crossing over between two gene loci  markers  is the crossing over value . for fixed set of genetic and environmental conditions  recombination in a particular region of a linkage structure  chromosome   tends to be constant and the same is then true for the crossing over value which is used in the production of genetic maps.
query	111	deoxyribonucleic acid    listen   dna  is a molecule composed of two chains that coil around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic instructions for the development  functioning  growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. dna and ribonucleic acid  rna  are nucleic acids  alongside proteins  lipids and complex carbohydrates  polysaccharides   nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. the two dna strands are also known as polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides. each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen containing nucleobases  cytosine  c   guanine  g   adenine  a  or thymine  t    a sugar called deoxyribose  and a phosphate group. the nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next  resulting in an alternating sugar phosphate backbone. the nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together  according to base pairing rules  a with t and c with g   with hydrogen bonds to make double stranded dna. the complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups  pyrimidines and purines. in dna  the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine  the purines are adenine and guanine. both strands of double stranded dna store the same biological information. this information is replicated as and when the two strands separate. a large part of dna  more than 98  for humans  is non coding  meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences. the two strands of dna run in opposite directions to each other and are thus antiparallel. attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases  informally  bases . it is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes genetic information. rna strands are created using dna strands as a template in a process called transcription  where dna bases are exchanged for their corresponding bases except in the case of thymine  t   which rna substitutes for uracil  u . under the genetic code  these rna strands specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation. within eukaryotic cells  dna is organized into long structures called chromosomes. before typical cell division  these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of dna replication  providing a complete set of chromosomes for each daughter cell. eukaryotic organisms  animals  plants  fungi and protists  store most of their dna inside the cell nucleus as nuclear dna  and some in the mitochondria as mitochondrial dna or in chloroplasts as chloroplast dna. in contrast  prokaryotes  bacteria and archaea  store their dna only in the cytoplasm  in circular chromosomes. within eukaryotic chromosomes  chromatin proteins  such as histones  compact and organize dna. these compacting structures guide the interactions between dna and other proteins  helping control which parts of the dna are transcribed. dna was first isolated by friedrich miescher in 1869. its molecular structure was first identified by francis crick and james watson at the cavendish laboratory within the university of cambridge in 1953  whose model building efforts were guided by x ray diffraction data acquired by raymond gosling  who was a post graduate student of rosalind franklin at king s college london. dna is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories  such as the ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity. the unique material properties of dna have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro  and nano fabrication. among notable advances in this field are dna origami and dna based hybrid materials.
query	112	hepatitis c is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis c virus  hcv  that primarily affects the liver. during the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. occasionally a fever  dark urine  abdominal pain  and yellow tinged skin occurs. the virus persists in the liver in about 75  to 85  of those initially infected. early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. over many years however  it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. in some cases  those with cirrhosis will develop serious complications such as liver failure  liver cancer  or dilated blood vessels in the esophagus and stomach.hcv is spread primarily by blood to blood contact associated with intravenous drug use  poorly sterilized medical equipment  needlestick injuries in healthcare  and transfusions. using blood screening  the risk from a transfusion is less than one per two million. it may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. it is not spread by superficial contact. it is one of five known hepatitis viruses  a  b  c  d  and e. diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or its rna. testing is recommended in all people who are at risk.there is no vaccine against hepatitis c. prevention includes harm reduction efforts among people who use intravenous drugs and testing donated blood. chronic infection can be cured about 95  of the time with antiviral medications such as sofosbuvir or simeprevir. peginterferon and ribavirin were earlier generation treatments that had a cure rate of less than 50  and greater side effects. getting access to the newer treatments however can be expensive. those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant. hepatitis c is the leading reason for liver transplantation  though the virus usually recurs after transplantation.an estimated 143 million people  2   worldwide are infected with hepatitis c as of 2015. in 2013  about eleven million new cases occurred. it occurs most commonly in africa and central and east asia. about 167 000 deaths due to liver cancer and 326 000 deaths due to cirrhosis occurred in 2015 due to hepatitis c. the existence of hepatitis c   originally identifiable only as a type of non a non b hepatitis   was suggested in the 1970s and proven in 1989. hepatitis c infects only humans and chimpanzees.
query	113	insomnia  also known as sleeplessness  is a sleep disorder in which people have trouble sleeping. they may have difficulty falling asleep  or staying asleep as long as desired. insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness  low energy  irritability  and a depressed mood. it may result in an increased risk of motor vehicle collisions  as well as problems focusing and learning. insomnia can be short term  lasting for days or weeks  or long term  lasting more than a month.insomnia can occur independently or as a result of another problem. conditions that can result in insomnia include psychological stress  chronic pain  heart failure  hyperthyroidism  heartburn  restless leg syndrome  menopause  certain medications  and drugs such as caffeine  nicotine  and alcohol. other risk factors include working night shifts and sleep apnea. diagnosis is based on sleep habits and an examination to look for underlying causes. a sleep study may be done to look for underlying sleep disorders. screening may be done with two questions   do you experience difficulty sleeping   and  do you have difficulty falling or staying asleep  sleep hygiene and lifestyle changes are typically the first treatment for insomnia. sleep hygiene includes a consistent bedtime  exposure to sunlight  a quiet and dark room  and regular exercise. cognitive behavioral therapy may be added to this. while sleeping pills may help  they are associated with injuries  dementia  and addiction. these medications are not recommended for more than four or five weeks. the effectiveness and safety of alternative medicine is unclear.between 10  and 30  of adults have insomnia at any given point in time and up to half of people have insomnia in a given year. about 6  of people have insomnia that is not due to another problem and lasts for more than a month. people over the age of 65 are affected more often than younger people. females are more often affected than males. descriptions of insomnia occur at least as far back as ancient greece.
query	114	the kidneys are two bean shaped organs found in vertebrates. they are located on the left and right in the retroperitoneal space  and in adult humans are about 11 centimetres  4.3 in  in length.  they receive blood from the paired renal arteries  blood exits into the paired renal veins. each kidney is attached to a ureter  a tube that carries excreted urine to the bladder. the nephron is the structural and functional unit of the kidney. each human adult kidney contains around 1 million nephrons  while a mouse kidney contains only about 12 500 nephrons. the kidney participates in the control of the volume of various body fluid compartments  fluid osmolality  acid base balance  various electrolyte concentrations  and removal of toxins. filtration occurs in the glomerulus  one fifth of the blood volume that enters the kidneys is filtered. examples of substances reabsorbed are solute free water  sodium  bicarbonate  glucose  and amino acids.  examples of substances secreted are hydrogen  ammonium  potassium and uric acid. the kidneys also carry out functions independent of the nephron. for example  they convert a precursor of vitamin d to its active form  calcitriol  and synthesize the hormones erythropoietin and renin. renal physiology is the study of kidney function. nephrology is the medical specialty which addresses diseases of kidney function   these include chronic kidney disease  nephritic and nephrotic syndromes  acute kidney injury  and pyelonephritis. urology addresses diseases of kidney  and urinary tract  anatomy  these include cancer  renal cysts  kidney stones and ureteral stones  and urinary tract obstruction.procedures used in the management of kidney disease include chemical and microscopic examination of the urine  urinalysis   measurement of kidney function by calculating the estimated glomerular filtration rate  egfr  using the serum creatinine  and kidney biopsy and ct scan to evaluate for abnormal anatomy. dialysis and kidney transplantation are used to treat kidney failure  one  or both sequentially  of these are almost always used when renal function drops below 15 . nephrectomy is frequently used to cure renal cell carcinoma.

query	117	the respiratory system  also respiratory apparatus  ventilatory system  is a biological system consisting of specific organs and structures used for gas exchange in animals and plants. the anatomy and physiology that make this happen varies greatly  depending on the size of the organism  the environment in which it lives and its evolutionary history. in land animals the respiratory surface is internalized as linings of the lungs. gas exchange in the lungs occurs in millions of small air sacs called alveoli in mammals and reptiles  but atria in birds. these microscopic air sacs have a very rich blood supply  thus bringing the air into close contact with the blood. these air sacs communicate with the external environment via a system of airways  or hollow tubes  of which the largest is the trachea  which branches in the middle of the chest into the two main bronchi. these enter the lungs where they branch into progressively narrower secondary and tertiary bronchi that branch into numerous smaller tubes  the bronchioles. in birds the bronchioles are termed parabronchi. it is the bronchioles  or parabronchi that generally open into the microscopic alveoli in mammals and atria in birds. air has to be pumped from the environment into the alveoli or atria by the process of breathing which involves the muscles of respiration. in most fish  and a number of other aquatic animals  both vertebrates and invertebrates  the respiratory system consists of gills  which are either partially or completely external organs  bathed in the watery environment. this water flows over the gills by a variety of active or passive means. gas exchange takes place in the gills which consist of thin or very flat filaments and lammelae which expose a very large surface area of highly vascularized tissue to the water. other animals  such as insects  have respiratory systems with very simple anatomical features  and in amphibians even the skin plays a vital role in gas exchange. plants also have respiratory systems but the directionality of gas exchange can be opposite to that in animals. the respiratory system in plants includes anatomical features such as stomata  that are found in various parts of the plant.
query	118	self esteem is an individual s subjective evaluation of their own worth. self esteem encompasses beliefs about oneself  for example   i am unloved    i am worthy   as well as emotional states  such as triumph  despair  pride  and shame.  smith and mackie  2007  defined it by saying  the self concept is what we think about the self  self esteem  is the positive or negative evaluations of the self  as in how we feel about it. self esteem is an attractive psychological construct because it predicts certain outcomes  such as academic achievement  happiness  satisfaction in marriage and relationships  and criminal behavior. self esteem can apply to a specific attribute  for example   i believe i am a good writer and i feel happy about that   or globally  for example   i believe i am a bad person  and i feel bad about myself in general  . psychologists usually regard self esteem as an enduring personality characteristic  trait self esteem   though normal  short term variations  state self esteem  also exist. synonyms or near synonyms of self esteem include many things  self worth  self regard   self respect  and self integrity.  
query	119	shock is the state of insufficient blood flow to the tissues of the body as a result of problems with the circulatory system. initial symptoms of shock may include weakness  fast heart rate  fast breathing  sweating  anxiety  and increased thirst. this may be followed by confusion  unconsciousness  or cardiac arrest  as complications worsen.shock is divided into four main types based on the underlying cause  low volume  cardiogenic  obstructive  and distributive shock. low volume shock  also known as hypovolemic shock  may be from bleeding  diarrhea  vomiting  or pancreatitis. cardiogenic shock may be due to a heart attack or cardiac contusion. obstructive shock may be due to cardiac tamponade or a tension pneumothorax. distributive shock may be due to sepsis  anaphylaxis  injury to the upper spinal cord  or certain overdoses.the diagnosis is generally based on a combination of symptoms  physical examination  and laboratory tests. a decreased pulse pressure  systolic blood pressure minus diastolic blood pressure  or a fast heart rate raises concerns. the heart rate divided by systolic blood pressure  known as the shock index  si   of greater than 0.8 supports the diagnosis more than low blood pressure or a fast heart rate in isolation.treatment of shock is based on the likely underlying cause. an open airway and sufficient breathing should be established. any ongoing bleeding should be stopped  which may require surgery or embolization. intravenous fluid  such as ringer s lactate or packed red blood cells  is often given. efforts to maintain a normal body temperature are also important. vasopressors may be useful in certain cases. shock is both common and has a high risk of death. in the united states about 1.2 million people present to the emergency room each year with shock and their risk of death is between 20 and 50 .
query	120	skin is the soft outer tissue covering of vertebrates with three main functions  protection  regulation  and sensation.other animal coverings  such as the arthropod exoskeleton  have different developmental origin  structure and chemical composition. the adjective cutaneous means  of the skin   from latin cutis  skin . in mammals  the skin is an organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue  and guards the underlying muscles  bones  ligaments and internal organs. skin of a different nature exists in amphibians  reptiles  and birds. all mammals have some hair on their skin  even marine mammals like whales  dolphins  and porpoises which appear to be hairless. the skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors. for example  the skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss. its other functions are insulation  temperature regulation  sensation  and the production of vitamin d folates.  severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue. this is sometimes discoloured and depigmented. the thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism. in humans for example  the skin located under the eyes and around  the eyelids is the thinnest skin in the body at 0.5 mm thick  and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as  crows feet  and wrinkles. the skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is 4 mm thick and is the thickest skin on the body. the speed and quality of wound healing in skin is promoted by the reception of estrogen.fur is dense hair. primarily   fur augments the insulation the skin provides but can also serve as a secondary sexual characteristic or as camouflage. on some animals  the skin is very hard and thick  and can be processed to create leather. reptiles and fish have hard protective scales on their skin for protection  and birds have hard feathers  all made of tough   keratins. amphibian skin is not a strong barrier  especially regarding the passage of chemicals via skin and is often subject to osmosis and diffusive forces. for example  a frog sitting in an anesthetic solution would be sedated quickly  as the chemical diffuses through its skin.  amphibian skin plays key roles in everyday survival and their ability to exploit a wide range of habitats and ecological conditions.
query	121	speech disorders or speech impediments are a type of communication disorder where  normal  speech is disrupted. this can mean stuttering  lisps  etc. someone who is unable to speak due to a speech disorder is considered mute.  
query	122	spinal muscular atrophy  sma  is a group of neuromuscular disorders that result in the loss of motor neurons and progressive muscle wasting. the severity of symptoms and age of onset varies by the type. some types are apparent at or before birth while others are not apparent until adulthood. all generally result in worsening muscle weakness associated with muscle twitching. arm  leg and respiratory muscles are generally affected first. associated problems may include problems with swallowing  scoliosis  and joint contractures. sma is a leading genetic cause of death in infants.spinal muscular atrophy is due to a genetic defect in the smn1 gene. they are inherited from a person s parents in an autosomal recessive manner. the smn1 gene encodes smn  a protein necessary for survival of motor neurons. loss of these neurons prevents the sending of signals between the brain and skeletal muscles. diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing.treatments include supportive care such as physical therapy  nutrition support  and mechanical ventilation. the medication nusinersen  which is injected around the spinal cord  slows the progression of the disease and improves muscle function. in 2019  the gene therapy onasemnogene abeparvovec was approved in the us as a treatment for children under 24 months. outcomes vary by type from a life expectancy of a few months to mild muscle weakness with a normal life expectancy. the condition affects about 1 in 10 000 people at birth.
query	123	testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and anabolic steroid. in male humans  testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate  as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass  and the growth of body hair. in addition  testosterone is involved in health and well being  and the prevention of osteoporosis. insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss. testosterone is a steroid from the androstane class containing a keto and hydroxyl groups at the three and seventeen positions respectively. it is biosynthesized in several steps from cholesterol and is converted in the liver to inactive metabolites.  it exerts its action through binding to and activation of the androgen receptor. in humans and most other vertebrates  testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and  to a lesser extent  the ovaries of females. on average  in adult males  levels of testosterone are about 7 to 8 times as great as in adult females. as the metabolism of testosterone in males is more pronounced  the daily production is about 20 times greater in men. females are also more sensitive to the hormone.in addition to its role as a natural hormone  testosterone is used as a medication in the treatment of low testosterone levels in men  transgender hormone therapy for transgender men  and breast cancer in women. since testosterone levels decrease as men age  testosterone is sometimes used in older men to counteract this deficiency. it is also used illicitly to enhance physique and performance  for instance in athletes.
query	124	thyroid hormones are two hormones produced and released by the thyroid gland  namely triiodothyronine  t3  and thyroxine  t4 .  they are tyrosine based hormones that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism. t3 and t4 are partially composed of iodine. a deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of t3 and t4  enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as simple goitre. the major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine  t4   which has a longer half life than t3. in humans  the ratio of t4 to t3 released into the blood is approximately 14 1. t4 is converted to the active t3  three to four times more potent than t4  within cells by deiodinases  5  iodinase . these are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine  t1a  and thyronamine  t0a . all three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium containing enzymes  thus dietary selenium is essential for t3 production. edward calvin kendall was responsible for the isolation of thyroxine in 1915. in 2016 levothyroxine  a manufactured form of thyroxine  was the most prescribed medication in the united states with more than 114 million prescriptions.
query	125	trichinosis is a parasitic disease caused by roundworms of the trichinella type. during the initial infection  invasion of the intestines can result in diarrhea  abdominal pain  and vomiting. migration of larvae to muscle  which occurs about a week after being infected  can cause swelling of the face  inflammation of the whites of the eyes  fever  muscle pains  and a rash. minor infection may be without symptoms. complications may include inflammation of heart muscle  central nervous system involvement  and inflammation of the lungs.trichinosis is mainly spread when undercooked meat containing trichinella cysts is eaten. most often this is pork  but infection can also occur from bear and dog meat. several species of trichinella can cause disease  with t. spiralis being the most common. after being eaten  the larvae are released from their cysts in the stomach. they then invade the wall of the small intestine  where they develop into adult worms. after one week  the females release new larvae that migrate to voluntarily controlled muscles  where they form cysts. the diagnosis is usually based on symptoms and confirmed by finding specific antibodies in the blood  or larvae on tissue biopsy.the best way to prevent trichinosis is to fully cook meat. a food thermometer can verify that the temperature inside the meat is high enough. infection is typically treated with antiparasitic medication such as albendazole or mebendazole. rapid treatment may kill adult worms and thereby stop further worsening of symptoms. both medications are considered safe  but have been associated with side effects such as bone marrow suppression. their use during pregnancy or in children under the age of 2 years is poorly studied  but appears to be safe. treatment with steroids is sometimes also required in severe cases. without treatment  symptoms typically resolve within three months.worldwide  about 10 000 infections occur a year. at least 55 countries including the united states  china  argentina  and russia have had recently documented cases. while the disease occurs in the tropics  it is less common there. rates of trichinosis in the united states have decreased from about 400 cases per year in the 1940s to 20 or fewer per year in the 2000s. the risk of death from infection is low.

query	165	adam and eve  according to the creation myth of the abrahamic religions  were the first man and woman. they are central to the belief that humanity is in essence a single family  with everyone descended from a single pair of original ancestors. it also provides the basis for the doctrines of the fall of man and original sin that are important beliefs in christianity  although not held in judaism or islam.in the book of genesis of the hebrew bible  chapters one through five  there are two creation narratives with two distinct perspectives. in the first  adam and eve are not named. instead  god created humankind in god s image and instructed them to multiply and to be stewards over everything else that god had made. in the second narrative  god fashions adam from dust and places him in the garden of eden. adam is told that he can eat freely of all the trees in the garden  except for a tree of the knowledge of good and evil. subsequently  eve is created from one of adam s ribs to be his companion. they are innocent and unembarrassed about their nakedness. however  a serpent deceives eve into eating fruit from the forbidden tree  and she gives some of the fruit to adam. these acts give them additional knowledge  but it gives them the ability to conjure negative and destructive concepts such as shame and evil. god later curses the serpent and the ground. god prophetically tells the woman and the man what will be the consequences of their sin of disobeying god. then he banishes them from the garden of eden. the story underwent extensive elaboration in later abrahamic traditions  and it has been extensively analyzed by modern biblical scholars. interpretations and beliefs regarding adam and eve and the story revolving around them vary across religions and sects  for example  the islamic version of the story holds that adam and eve were equally responsible for their sins of hubris  instead of eve being the first one to be unfaithful. the story of adam and eve is often depicted in art  and it has had an important influence in literature and poetry. the story of the fall of adam is often considered to be an allegory. findings in population genetics  particularly those concerning y chromosomal adam and mitochondrial eve  indicate that a single first  adam and eve  pair of human beings never existed.
