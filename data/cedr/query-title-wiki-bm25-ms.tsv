query	1	have benchmarking overclock a graphics card  before you start overclocking  you ll want to make sure you are running the latest drivers on your video card. you can download the latest drivers from the nvidia or amd site  depending on which manufacturer you have. having the latest drivers will ensure that your card is running as stably as possible. newer drivers often increase overclocking performance as well.  to overclock  you will need a few different programs  all of which are available for free. these programs will give you performance benchmarks  allow you to adjust your card timing and voltage  and monitor temperature performance.   download a benchmark program   there are several available  but one of the quickest and most intuitive is heaven. it is available for free from unigine  the developers. another popular program is 3dmark. download an overclocking program. while both nvidia and amd have overclocking utilities of their own  msi afterburner is one of the most popular and widely used programs. despite it s name  it will work with virtually every graphics card from both nvidia and amd.download a monitoring program. although benchmark and overclocking programs will report temperatures and speeds  sometimes it s good to have another monitor to make sure that all of your settings take. gpu z is a lightweight program that will monitor the temperature  clock speed  memory speed  and every other aspect of your graphics card.    going into your overclocking process without being informed can cost you a lot of time and cause you a lot of headaches later on. you want to find the clock speeds that other users who have your exact same card are getting. you also need to find what is generally considered to be your card s highest safe voltage.   do not immediately apply these numbers to your card. since every card is different  there s no telling what could happen if you enter the wrong numbers. instead  use them as a guide during the overclocking process to judge how effective your numbers are. try forums such as overclock.net to find other overclockers who have the same card that you do. overclocking a laptop s gpu is not recommended. laptops have a much harder time dissipating heat  and overclocking can quickly lead to dangerous temperatures.    you will need to install it after downloading it. most users will be able to leave the settings at their default during installation. once your program is installed  open it to start the benchmarking process.    before you start the benchmarking  you will be able to adjust the graphics settings. adjust them to whatever you would like  and make sure that resolution is set to  desktop . if the benchmark program does not perform well with the settings you pick  you can change them later.    the benchmark program will begin  and after a few moments of loading scenes will begin playing on your monitor. if the performance is poor  you can exit and lower your settings  but this isn t necessary. during the overclocking process  you should see performance improve without having to adjust the settings.    once the scenes start playing  you will see a row of buttons at the top of the screen. click the benchmark button to start the benchmark process. in heaven  this will run through 26 different scenes  and will take several minutes to complete. after the benchmark is over  you will be given a score based on your graphics card s performance.    write down the score that you get. this will help you easily compare results as you increase the speed of your card.    you will see a list of sliders on the left side of the program and a hardware monitor on the right. you can also run gpu z now to have an additional monitor to verify readings.    this slider controls the core clock speed of your gpu. if your card has a shader clock slider  make sure that it is linked to the core clock slider. you will see a link icon between the two if they are linked.    when making adjustments to the speed of your clock for the first time  it is always advisable to go by small amounts  such as 10mhz. this amount allows you to see improvements  but not accidentally go overboard.    the changes should take effect immediately. look at your readings in gpu z to ensure that the new speed is showing.    once you ve made your first adjustment and verified it  it s time to run the benchmark program again and get your new score. when the benchmark program is running  pay attention to see if image quality or frame rate improves noticeably from the first time.   if the benchmark program runs without any issue  then your overclock is stable so far and you can continue.    continue raising your speed in 10mhz intervals  checking the results in the benchmark program each time. sooner or later  you ll start running into instabilities.   instabilities will manifest as black screens  graphical glitches  artifacts  bad colors  blotches  and more.    once you hit an instability  you can either revert your settings to the last speed that was working well  or you can try increasing your voltage. if you ve seen noticeable improvements  or you don t want to risk damaging your card due to increasing the power flow  revert to the last working speed and skip down to part five. if you want to keep pushing your card  leave the speed as it is and move on to the next section.    the core voltage sliders is locked by default to prevent accidental damage to your card. this alone should tell you how potentially serious doing this is. check the  unlock voltage control  box in the general tab and click ok.    you will unlikely be able to select exactly 10mv  as voltages can only be increased by set amounts. click apply.    once you ve increased your voltage  run your benchmarking program to see if your overclock is stable now. remember  you left your settings at a speed that was unstable  so if it is stable now after raising your voltage you can go back to increasing your clock speed.    if your overclock is stable now  start raising the core clock speed in 10mhz intervals again  running benchmarks each time. repeat this until you reach the next instability.    as voltage increases  the temperature of your gpu will start to go up. as you continue the process of increasing your voltage  keep an eye on your temperature readings in gpu z. it s recommended to keep temperatures below 90  c  194  f   but many enthusiasts prefer to keep it even cooler  such as 80  and below.   improving your case s and card s cooling can help you increase your overclocking capabilities  but can be expensive and time consuming.    once you reach your next plateau  raise the core voltage by 10mv again. benchmark  and then repeat the core clock process. remember to keep watching your temperature  as this will be one of the big limiting factors in how far you can take the overclock.    remember the notes you took about your card earlier  make sure that you don t exceed the safe voltage limit for your card when you are making your adjustments.    at a certain point  your overclock will stop being effective. you may reach your temperature threshold  your maximum voltage  or your clock speeds may just not be stable no matter how much your voltage increases. if that s the case then you can move on to the next step.    once you ve hit the limit with your core clock  it s time to do the same with your memory clock. repeat the process by raising the memory clock in 10mhz intervals  raising the voltage when you hit instabilities  if you haven t maxed out your safe voltage or temperature yet .   make sure to keep running the benchmark after each adjustment. raising the memory clock can lead to increases  but at a certain point it will actually start hurting performance. pay attention to your benchmark scores to get it just right.    the process for overclocking sli cards is pretty much the same as a single card. each card needs to be overclocked individually  and the slower card will always dictate the overall speed. since no two cards are the same  one of your cards will be held back a little by the other. follow the above steps to overclock each individual card.    performing your stress test is going to take a significant amount of time  so make sure you aren t going to need your computer for the next few hours. it s a fairly hands off process  but you ll want to be able to check in and evaluate performance.    instead of starting the  benchmark  process in heaven  click run and just let it go. heaven will continue to cycle through the scenes until you tell it otherwise.    as the scenes continue to play  keep your eyes open for any glitches  artifacts  or full on crashes. these indicate an unstable overclock  and you ll need to go back and lower your settings. if you make it through the stress test without issue  4 5 hours   then it s game time.    benchmark programs are great  but they aren t the reason you re overclocking  the games are. open up your favorite game and test out the performance. your old settings should work much better  and you may be able to crank them up to something higher 
query	2	take bodybuilding take creatine for bodybuilding  there is a sea full of information available on the backgrounds of creatine that can be easily accessed over the internet.    you can always seek advice from a professional who can tell you what is best and what will suit your needs.    don t opt for cheaper brands as you won t be getting the high quality creatine which is important to your physical health. use the internet to find a brand that other people have reviewed as high quality e.g optimum nutrition. once you choose a brand make a purchase either over the internet or in your local nutrition store. when you have chosen your brand ensure you purchase the same one again so that you aren t mixing different brands.    some products state that you should do a creatine  loading phase  for a certain amount of days so that your body will be  saturated  with creatine. this is not entirely necessary as your body does not need this phase in order to get to the  saturated  state. taking the product 5g 10g a day should be enough for you to benefit from taking it.    constantly supplementing with creatine can put stress on the liver and kidneys and can lead to problems. only take creatine in stages such as 2 months on and 2 months off to give your body a rest from supplementation. use it particularly when building up to a competition such as a race or heavy powerlifting session.  
query	3	brainstorm brainstorming brainstorm  before you look at what you want to do  think about what you re trying to achieve. this can give you a good starting point  a sort of light at the end of the tunnel.   do you want to brainstorm for your business  are you trying to come up with an idea for you next work of art  maybe you re trying to come up with an idea for an article you have to write     if you have a teacher  boss  client  or someone that will be evaluating your work  find out what they re expecting or what they need. if not  just think about the limitations you must work within and what the final product should accomplish. while breaking requirements can sometimes result in a better experience and final product  knowing all of the limitations will give you a good framework to start working in.   for example  do you need to keep to a certain budget  do you need to use only certain materials  does the project need to be done by a certain time     you ll naturally be assuming some things about your project. what are people looking for  what are your limitations  what is acceptable or normal  what should it generally look like  list these assumptions so that you can play on them later.   for example  with an art project  we might assume that people are looking for a particular color scheme that fits with the theme of a gallery show. for a business project  we might assume that customers are wanting a particular something that our competitor s product does not provide.    take a hard look at what you ve done in the past  what you ve done already  and what you have available to you in terms of resources. this will help give you some boundaries to work with.   what kind of tools do you have to use  what materials or people have you not made use of in a long time  what was something you tried last year and how could it be better  ask others for their opinions.    do some research on what people working on similar projects have been doing. google is your friend in this adventure. you should not be looking at what others are doing in order to copy them. instead  you should be seeing where their ideas fall short or what pieces of their project might fit into yours.    once you see what run of the mill folks are doing  find out what the innovators are doing. seek out the cutting edge and fringe ideas or techniques that other people are experimenting with. you might want to similarly experiment  such innovation can set you apart  making what you do unique  memorable  and appealing.    get outside of your usual environment. this is a great way to break yourself out of the standard creation loop and think of things that you ve never thought of before. go for a walk  go to a local artisan or farmer s market  or work in a cafe for awhile. any change of environment can help you think in different ways.    always have a journal next to your bed. you ll also want to keep a waterproof note taking option in your shower area. good ideas often sneak up on us when we re doing these other activities  but then get lost as we get distracted with whatever else it is we re doing. by having a pen and paper nearby  you ll be able to quickly jot down the things you think of before they fly away     it s important to take breaks  to keep your mind clear of negative response loops. a lot of the time  when you re thinking and coming up with nothing  you get too focused on the fact that you re coming up with nothing  making it impossible to really think.   try having a healthy snack  catch up with a coworker  or do a quick chore  such as cleaning up your mess from dinner .    during the brainstorming process  criticism isn t helpful. you ll need the freedom of minimal boundaries in order to get to new ideas. leave criticism for once you have a long list of possibilities.   if you re brainstorming with other people  you might need to remind some people to keep negative opinions to themselves until the brainstorming activity is done.    don t try to brainstorm with just a cold start. this is like breaking out into a full run without a light jog first  do a quick exercise that gets your head in that space  such as making a menu for your next week s worth of dinners  or coming up with a wish list of things you d like to accomplish in work  school  or whatever it is you re doing.    put yourself in the shoes of your competitor  looking at what you re doing now and trying to figure out how to be better than you. how would they look at what you re doing and do things better  what would they change  where would they go next     giving yourself new roadblocks to reaching your goal  such as a lower budget  a new deadline  or a specific material to be used  can make you more creative and innovative. it may even give you an idea if you couldn t come up with one before.    mind maps are one of the most popular brainstorming techniques. this is where you write down an idea  or several   on a notecard. pin the note card to a wall and then build on the idea. write down every little thing you think of and start connecting the ideas.    create three categories  easy ideas  tough ideas  and crazy ideas. try to come up with at least five ideas for each category. usually  in coming up with ideas we think we can t or shouldn t actually carry out  we find ourselves with ideas that we actually can use.    write a poem that describes what you re trying to do. you can also write a theoretical analysis or review of the thing you re hoping to create. by outlining what you re hoping to get out of the project  you may have an easier time thinking of ways to do it.    take something you ve done before  a long time ago  and find a way to update it. you can also take old concepts that aren t yours and find a way to bring them into this era. for example  twitter was basically telegrams for the internet. some of the most popular products right now make use of classic designs.    online idea generators can be really helpful in getting you started  even if it s just used as a warm up. don t feel burdened by or tied to the ideas that it gives you  but try to use them as a jumping off point. try this    http   ideagenerator.creativitygames.net     always ask questions. ask questions of yourself. ask questions of the people you re brainstorming with. ask questions of your friends and family members. questions lead us to really think through things that we might have glazed over in our minds. ask detailed questions and questions that really get at the heart of the issue. and don t go for the short  obvious answer.   why do i want to paint with oils  why does my customer want this product     there are lots of little exercises  like mind maps  that can be really useful. but a lot of the time they re also a distraction and can hold you back from really getting work done. don t waste too much time on brainstorming activities  and instead try to just get down to business as quickly as possible.    free writing is where you start writing and you just don t stop. this also involves some free association  where you naturally follow the course that your thoughts take instead of trying to direct the current. just write down a sentence that deals with the topic you re trying to brainstorm on and then follow your brain  writing down every word that ambles through your internal dialogue without stopping to think. you never know where it will lead you   
query	4	start chain smoking limit smoking cigarettes  before you change your behavior  you need to understand your current situation. take a baseline  or keep a count  of how many cigarettes you smoke in a day. you can use a calendar  notebook  journal  poster board  or anything that helps you track it consistently. as you track your consumption  try to notice if there are any patterns.   for example  you might notice that on wednesdays you tend to smoke 5 8 more cigarettes than the rest of the week. what is going on on wednesdays  maybe you have a stressful weekly meeting on wednesdays that wind you up  and you smoke to relieve the anxiety.    set a goal once you have tracked how many cigarettes you typically smoke in a day. since quitting cold turkey  cutting out smoking completely  is bound to be stressful  difficult  and may lead to a higher rate of relapse  start by limiting your smoking. you may try going from a pack a day  20 cigarettes  to 15 a day.only you can decide what is the right amount to cut down to  but a good start may be to cut down by a quarter. for example  if you smoke 16 a day  go to 12. or go from 12 to 8.    if you are going to allow yourself five cigarettes a day  decide when you will smoke them. this removes the option of smoking a cigarette when you are feeling bored or have nothing else to do.instead  you have designated smoking times to keep you accountable.   for example  you might smoke one in the morning  two at work  one in the evening  and one before bed.    it may be hard to give up the instant gratification of smoking  especially if there s no immediate reward for cutting back. you need to create a system of immediate rewards and consequences. so  if you smoke 2 more cigarettes in a day than you had allowed yourself to  there should be a consequence. choose consequences that will benefit you in some way.   for example  for every additional cigarette you smoke  tell yourself you have to do 10 minutes of stretching  put a dollar in a jar  clean the bathroom  or journal for an extra 10 minutes. while this is supposed to serve somewhat as a punishment  at least you will have worked in some way to make up for the lapse in discipline.  reward yourself when you meet or exceed your goals. this will make you more likely to continue cutting back. rewards don t need to be tangible things. you could remind yourself that you re investing in your healthy future and that s a reward in and of itself.for example  if your goal was to smoke no more than 8 cigarettes a day and you only smoked 5  you might reward yourself with a glass of wine  20 minutes of playing your favorite video game  or free time. choose something that you enjoy  but don t necessarily have access to all the time.  this will create a progress report. you could even graph your cigarette consumption in order to see the peaks and troughs. here are a few things to consider keeping track of when you re monitoring your smoking habits triggers  watch for what factors trigger higher rates of smoking. cost  track how much money you spend on cigarettes every week. if you re saving money during the week  start putting it aside. after a few weeks  use the money to buy yourself a reward. consequences rewards  notice if certain intervention plans  like increasing or decreasing consequences and rewards  are working or not. this way you can change them to make cutting back more effective.    you may want to limit time around social groups that revolve around smoking. instead  find new places and activities to enjoy.if you enjoy having a few drinks and smoking on the patio at a local bar  you might find it hard to sit on the patio and not smoke. in this case  try moving inside where smoking is not allowed. this will add a level of inconvenience to smoking since you ll have to leave the group you are with to go outside.   give yourself the rule  no smoking in the car. smoke before or after the car ride. make smoking as inconvenient and uncomfortable as possible.  while this isn t an overwhelming change  changing brands may help you reduce your nicotine intake. for example  if you smoke marlboro red 100 s  try switching to shorts or to a more  natural  brand of cigarettes like sherman s. do not let the word  natural  make you think these cigarettes are safe. they are most definitely cigarettes which still contain nicotine. look for cigarettes based on their nicotine content  which are generally low nicotine  filtered cigarettes with the words  ultra light  medium nicotine  filtered cigarettes with the words  light  or  mild  high nicotine  filtered or unfiltered cigarettes that don t say  light  or  ultra light     another way to reduce cigarette smoking is by smoking a quarter or half of a cigarette. then wait until your next cigarette break to smoke the second half or quarter.this way  you smoke as often as you normally do  but only half a cigarette at a time. you still get to take your smoking breaks  but it cuts your cigarette consumption in half.    if you tend to chain smoke in certain settings like a bar or while sitting outside chatting with friends  try setting a timer. it can be easy to lose track and just light another cigarette when you are having a good time. after each cigarette  set a timer on your phone for a time limit of your choosing. wait until the timer goes off before smoking another cigarette.   as time goes on  try to increase the amount of time in between cigarettes. for example  if you set the timer for 20 minutes  push yourself to wait an extra 2 minutes. if you and your friend are both trying to cut down  you can make it into a small competitive game on who can wait longer.  sometimes it is the oral stimulation that needs to be satisfied in addition to the nicotine craving. carry things like breath mints  gum  mouthwash sprays  small hard candy  sunflower seeds  or other small  ideally healthy  snacks for whenever you feel the urge to smoke.avoid high sugar or fattening treats that will just fill you up. make sure not to use treats as an oral substitute for the long term.  tell those around you that you are working on this goal. this can create a good social support network to help you reduce your intake. they can also keep you accountable by asking you how you are doing with your goal. if you have friends that smoke  let them know you are trying to cut down so they do not tempt you.you may even inspire your friends or family to cut down as well. consider referring some of your closer friends and family to this website to help them help you  http   smokefree.gov social support.  a therapist will help you work through issues and stressors that caused you to smoke in the first place. you can work with a therapist in an individual or group setting. cognitive behavioral therapy can help you learn to deal with stress and make you feel more confident about quitting smoking.you can search the national association of cognitive behavioral therapists database for certified therapists. your general practitioner may also be able to recommend a therapist. be sure to find out about any fees that aren t covered by insurance in advance.  stress is a common trigger for cigarette smoking. while it s impossible to completely avoid stress  setting up a coping strategy will help prevent stress smoking.if you start to feel stressed out and crave something to relax you  try replacing smoking with one of the following    a short conversation with a friend 10 minutes to yourself to sit quietly and meditate or stretch a small walk around the block  office  park  or building journal writing for 10 minutes watching a funny video exercising  which can improve your health and help you counter the weight gain that can sometimes come with cigarette cessation.    social support can reduce smoking  but in the end it is up to you. sticking with it is one of the hardest parts and setbacks will occur. the important thing is to not completely give up when you have those lapses in discipline. it happens to everyone. you are learning to live your life without a habit that is a central part of your day  and is often associated with so many areas of your life throughout your day. learning to cut down takes persistence  patience  consistency  and a lot of self kindness.keep tracking  even if you relapse. keep implementing bigger rewards and consequences as time goes on.    once you ve started limiting and reducing your cigarette consumption  you may find that you are ready to quit entirely. you might want to join a support group where you can talk about your cravings and how to reduce them. you could also try incorporating one of the following    nicotine replacement therapy  nrt   this includes nicotine inhalers  oral medications  patches  and gums. they deliver the nicotine without the act of smoking.don t use nrt if you are still smoking  since they can cause a toxic increase in nicotine levels. if you are trying to cut down on smoking  but are not necessarily ready to quit  nrt may not be the best option for you.e cigarettes  electronic cigarettes may help you reduce or quit smoking.while e cigs simulate the puffing of smoking  which may help wean people from traditional cigarettes  it may actually replace smoking instead of wean people off smoking. though e cigs might be less toxic than traditional cigarettes  there is limited research about their safety. caution should be taken when using an e cig as it tends to create the perception that it is a safe alternative.  
query	5	get funding funding get funding for a startup business  the largest microfinance program in the us is the small business administration s microloan program. the sba works with dozens of intermediary lenders across the country to provide microloans to small businesses  startups included  but most of the lenders only lend in designated geographical areas.take a look at the list of intermediaries at https   www.sba.gov sites default files articles microlenderrpt 20160518.pdf.    a business plan is a document telling any interested party exactly what you plan on doing with the business and how you plan to do it. writing a business plan will help you seem credible and help you obtain funding. there s an art to writing a business plan  but the basic portions of the plan include the summary. you ll talk about the location of the business  the mission statement  the products you offer  and the purpose of the business plan  in this case  getting funding . a company description  including the legal form of the business  it s history  growth  and your short and long term goals. a detailed overview of your products and services  including new products not yet introduced. a market analysis  which includes information on total market size  your share of the market  and how you plan on growing. your overall market strategy. your financial plan  including projections with and without the funding you re seeking.    the various intermediaries have some leeway with respect to crafting their approval process. once you ve found some lenders servicing your area call them or go to their website and learn about their requirements for loan approval. some common requirements include    a business plan it helps if you ve already got a business plan  but if you don t  nearly all of the lenders will assist you in crafting one. the business plan not only helps the lender understand your business goals  it helps you develop realistic expectations for the future of your startup.collateral for the loan. since most of the microloan borrowers don t have a business track record  incomes  or credit history that would support a conventional loan  the lender wants assurances that the borrower is serious about the success of the business venture. collateral can be items like cars  real estate  jewelry  or equipment you plan to buy with the proceeds of the loan.an alternate source of income. almost all of the lenders will require the borrower to have an alternative source of income in case of default.    although microlenders are more lenient with respect to credit scores than conventional lenders  they still have to make sure borrowers can pay them back  and the easiest way to make it appear as though you won t be able to pay them back is to be behind in your current accounts.this includes back taxes. if you do owe back taxes  you should at least get current on a payment plan before trying to get a loan.    microlenders do their best to consider the whole person and their fitness for leading their proposed business venture. one of the ways they measure a borrower s commitment is by checking up on the details associated with business ownership. one of those details is finding out whether the borrower has requested an employer identification number  or ein  from the irs.the ein is like the social security number for a business. having an ein is a prerequisite to legally employing workers in the us. any serious business owner will need one sooner than later. request an ein at https   www.irs.gov businesses small businesses self employed apply for an employer identification number ein online.    in the same vein as the ein  you should take steps to register your business. there are pros and cons to the various types of business formats  but the worst one is the sole proprietorship  which is the default. if your business is organized as a sole proprietorship  it means you are personally obligated to satisfy the business  liabilities.   look into the corporate and limited liability company  llc  formats instead. an llc will probably be the best for a small business  but your circumstances might indicate otherwise. if you need a more detailed guide on the advantages and disadvantages of each type of business form  you can learn more at determine if you need to incorporate. you ll register with the secretary of state in your state. find you secretary of state s website on the webpage for the national association of secretaries of state  located at http   www.nass.org .    you might not be able to get the size loan you want to get  so divide your launch plan into phases. each phase should get the business to a stage where it s making more money than it s spending. that doesn t mean it s making as much money as you want it to be making  or that it can support you or your family. all it means is that you ve gotten to a level of sustainability.for example  if you can only get  5 000 of the  10 000 you were requesting  you need to have a plan formulated  call it phase 1  where  5 000 can get you off the ground and to sustainability.    a crowdfunding campaign showcases an entrepreneur s idea to the public  asking for contributions to make the entrepreneur s vision into reality. in order to do that effectively  the crowd needs to be convinced the entrepreneur s vision is something to be pursued.you have to do more than just tell your story. the crowd needs to identify with the story you re telling. your good idea gets them to listen to you and give you their time  but it s your story that gets them to give to you at the exclusion of everyone else. so  if you started selling prosthetic limbs because you lost your leg in iraq  tell the story of how you lost your leg and how it lead you to want to create better products.    a crowdfunding campaign isn t promising a return on investment. it offers the chance to help fund the development of a project for the donor to feel like they are part of the story you told so well. but they don t want to be a part of a tragedy or a farce  so they can t feel like they re wasting their money. to avoid that  you need to appear knowledgeable and competent.even if you don t realize it  you re already the world s foremost authority on your project. still  you need to organize your thinking about it. learn it cold. you ll know you re ready when you know it so well you can immediately and fluently explain to anyone what your goals and projections are at six months  one year  eighteen months and two years from startup. turn yourself into a walking infomercial business plan.    you want to create buzz around your campaign  because campaigns with buzz make the most money. one way to create buzz is by setting and meeting funding goals. set goals at intervals like 10   25   50   and so on. in order to meet your milestones  lean heavily on your personal network  especially in the beginning . hit up the usual suspects  like your immediate family and your regular circle of friends  but don t stop there. that facebook friend from high school you haven t spoken to in six years  there s never been a better time to catch up.do something special for your donors when you reach each milestone. the quicker you hit milestones  the more momentum you ll have  and the more funding you ll get. for example  if your crowdfunding goal is to open a restaurant  you could send each of your donors a sweet treat from your kitchen when you hit each milestone. even if your donors are mostly friends and family in the beginning  that s ok. treating them like customers makes you seem more professional.    most people s personal networks aren t large enough to get them all the way to their funding goal. so once you ve tapped your personal networks  kick it up a notch. begin your social media campaign in earnest after you ve hit a milestone or two. there s nothing sadder than going to the landing page of a crowdfunding appeal and seeing that no one s donated anything yet.you can try engineering a social media campaign yourself or you can pay a social media marketer to do it for you. if you re the type with 3 000 facebook friends  you ll probably get a lot of mileage from a do it yourself effort. if you re the type with 300  which is an average number  don t feel bad   you might want to bring in some help by paying someone.    the closer you are to getting funded  the more professional and poised for success you need to seem. so  while you might have been able to skimp on production values in the beginning  leave some money in reserve to add polish and increase production values as you go.for example  the longer your campaign goes on  the more important it is for you to attend to things like integrating logos into your landing page and emails and paying for professional video editing for your funding pitches.    many people who would happily send their cousin an email soliciting a donation for their crowdfunding campaign are reluctant to make the same approach in person. many others will have solicited their family members for donations before anyone else.the advantage of going to family for donations is that they can take into account factors like your determination and overall character when considering loaning you money. they also don t usually charge interest. the disadvantage is that you ll probably know them for a long time to come  and adding loaned money into the family dynamic can create tension. there is no helpful script to give a person in this situation. you know your family. you know the kind of appeal they will sympathize with. just give it some forethought  explain the work you ve put in already  and how a certain amount of money will help you get to the goal.    two types of hybrid financing to consider are peer to peer lending and equity crowdfunding. both combine features of crowdfunding with another type of lending  and they can be a good option for individuals who are struggling to get financing in other ways.   equity crowdfunding combines features of crowd funding with angel investing. like crowdfunding  the borrower makes a pitch to a wide audience on an online platform. like angel investing  the investor loans money on the basis of getting a stake in the business. some popular platforms are angellist  fundable  and equitynet.peer to peer lending combines the wide audience of a crowdfunding platform with personal lending. the peer to peer platform vets the borrowers for a minimum level of creditworthiness. if they pass  then they make a pitch and receive a personal loan if there is any interest in their project. some popular platforms are prosper  peerform  upstart  and kiva.  while the terms of personal loans are usually only a little better than a credit card  the borrower can often access more  which sometimes makes them attractive. don t be fooled though  some of the loans have harsher terms than a credit card. just make sure you read the fine print before you sign.   take kabbage as an example. kabbage is a lender that promises approvals within minutes. they offer to lend more on a personal loan than most traditional banks and with less paperwork. the trouble comes when the interest starts to accrue kabbage actually makes loans at 100  interest and more. notwithstanding the fact that interest rates that high used to be illegal  paying them off can require a superhuman effort  and the near certain default can be a quick road to financial ruin.    financing your start up through credit cards should be your last resort. the interest rates are too high and the credit limits are often too low. while that doesn t dissuade many would be entrepreneurs from doing it anyway  it s never a good idea. a great many startups fail before they hit the two year mark  and cash flow usually has something to do with it.

query	8	suggest a foreign language thats easy to learn language acquisition learn a foreign language with songs  when browsing local book stores or online shops  one might feel the urge to buy material that is way out of one s personal language level. novels for example  even famous ones  children s books  if you have just started learning  or material like movies  or tv shows. the sad truth is  that as a beginner this kind of material is more frustrating than helpful  as a too high number of new words and grammar items will just impede your natural progress and lower your motivation. it is very important to choose material that suits your level of knowledge and vocabulary.   the good thing about music and song lyrics is that we connect them emotionally and have a much easier time shifting those words into our long term memory. on the other hand  when listening to music  we don t ascribe too much importance to the correct use of grammar  the learning effect is much more passive. things you might look for are   search for your favorite song in any foreign language see the exact translation to every word of the song sing along to it learn it by heart practice with a number of language games use the built in vocabulary trainer to never forget the song    this is especially important and sets you apart from normal fans and listeners of that foreign music. if you know  even only rudimentarily what all the words in a song are supposed to mean  you can automatically get an insight on how the language works. make sure to review this step  as it is easy to forget the meaning of the most unusual words.  have you ever had a school assignment to learn a poem by heart  didn t you also get a deeper sense of understanding what the poet meant  after you learned it  the same effect applies to music. once you know a song by heart and have a rough understanding of its meaning  in theory  you just put 30 to 50 new words into your long term memory. but not only the words themselves are being processed. having the song always in your mind  sets your brain free to ponder about it even when you aren t consciously thinking about it.  and enjoy learning it  learning a song should be fun and give you insight into a different culture  explain to you what people of different countries care to sing about. if it is just simple  but not your type of music  then your progress will also slow down.  if you are into anime or western animation  try theme songs  disney songs have always been translated into up to 30  languages. pop songs are usually easy to understand  as they have similar themes. children s songs might also be helpful  as they are also being used to teach the language to native children    if you want to have a long lasting effect from your learning efforts  write flashcards like you would do with any other textbook. write down the words you didn t know and see how much easier the reviewing gets  when you already formed an emotional connection with these words.  try to incorporate the words you just learned. they might seem outdated or lyrical but if people correct you  you learn something new  if they laugh  you can make a new friend   but always remember  songs won t teach you key phrases like  hello  or  goodbye . make sure to learn them in advance when travelling to a foreign country. they will probably make up 90 percent of your initial conversation   
query	9	help you come up with possible solutions mediation solve inheritance disputes with mediation  since mediation is a voluntary process  everyone involved in the dispute must be willing to come together and use mediation as a means to resolve the inheritance dispute.there typically aren t any formal requirements for providing notice to the other parties  and you typically don t have to provide this notice in writing. if you re comfortable doing so  a simple phone call to let the other parties know that you want to try mediation should be sufficient. you may want to get someone else  such as the executor or personal representative of the estate  to contact the other parties involved in the dispute if you don t think they ll listen to you. focus on the benefits of mediation. explain to reluctant parties that mediation is a way to keep things private and confidential rather than potentially airing the family s dirty laundry in a protracted and public legal battle. mediation also can help preserve the peace in the family and smooth the way toward more respectful and honest relationships because the process is voluntary and collaborative  not adversarial.    you may want to use a large alternate dispute resolution agency to handle the mediation  or you may feel more comfortable at a smaller community mediation clinic. the clerk of the probate court typically will have a list of court approved mediators from which you can choose.if you know an attorney who you trust  you also might want to ask them if they can give you the names of some mediators. many mediators are former attorneys  and attorneys often work with mediators so they likely have recommendations. your state or local bar association also may have a list of mediators in your area from which you can choose. the mediator you select should be a neutral person unaffiliated with any of the parties in your dispute  who has received training in mediation techniques and has experience resolving inheritance disputes. you may want to interview several mediators before you make your final decision  so you can compare and contrast and make sure you re choosing the best person.    once you ve chosen your mediator  you and the other parties involved in the dispute will have to work together to schedule a date for the mediation appointment.generally  you want to make sure you have a three to four hour block of time you can commit to the mediation session. for example  you don t want to schedule an appointment at 3 p.m. if you know you ll have to leave to pick your children up from school at 4 p.m. keep in mind that if the situation is complex or there are a lot of people involved  it may take several mediation sessions to reach a mutually agreeable compromise.    mediation is considerably more laid back than a courtroom trial  but you ll still want to have a decent outline of your position on the issues  evidence to back up your points  and a clear understanding of how you want the dispute resolved.at a minimum  you ll want to get a copy of the will and make sure you ve read it thoroughly and understand what it says. if there are any other estate documents  you ll want copies of those as well. other documents you may want to gather and take with you to the mediation include any cards or letters you received from the deceased person in which they talked about their end of life plans or the inheritance of their property.    in many inheritance dispute there are witnesses who can help back up your claims  and you can have them draft a written statement of what they saw or heard  or have them accompany you to the mediation.for example  if you believe your cousin  who was taking care of your father at the end of his life  unduly influenced him into changing his will while he was sick and vulnerable  you might want to talk to other people or health care professionals who were around your father at the time. if the inheritance dispute concerns a promise the deceased person made to you that was not reflected in the will  you may not have any written evidence that they made that promise   but there may be friends or other family members who overheard it. anyone even tangentially involved in the dispute should be present at the mediation  or at least available by phone. having people there encourages everyone to talk to each other openly and honestly so you can all get to the root of the problem.    you don t need an attorney to represent you at a mediation  but you might want to hire one if the other party has an attorney or if you find the other party particularly intimidating.an attorney also may be beneficial if there is a lot of money potentially at stake or there are significant legal issues involved. you also can have an attorney help you prepare for the mediation  but not actually go with you. if you re concerned about money  this can be a more cost efficient way to get legal advice and assistance. in addition to providing emotional support  an attorney can advise you on negotiation strategy and how to communicate your thoughts and feelings.    your mediation appointment typically will take place in the mediator s office. you probably want to try to get there a few minutes early so you have time to get situated before mediation starts.keep in mind that some mediation services prohibit the mediators from talking to you before the session begins  so you probably don t want to get there too early unless you re prepared to sit in awkward silence. bring along any documents on which you want to rely  as well as any people who have bearing on the issue or who can offer you emotional support. a mediation session is not a trial  so you don t have to dress like you re going to court   although you can if you want. just make sure whatever you re wearing is clean and neat  and refrain from wearing graphic t shirts or anything that might be too distracting.    a mediation typically begins with some comments from the mediator  who will introduce him  or herself and explain the procedures. then each party will have an opportunity to tell their side of the story and what they want out of mediation.while everyone will be in the same room  the mediator will take care to make sure the playing field is even and no one feels intimidated or threatened. the mediator will explain the ground rules for the mediation session  and may provide everyone present a written handout of those rules. make sure you understand them and ask any questions before discussions begin. each party typically has the opportunity to make a statement to the room. you will be instructed not to interrupt anyone while they are speaking  so they all have an equal chance to present their positions. since you requested the mediation  you typically will be given the first opportunity to speak. you don t necessarily have to restrict your statement to just the facts  but you should explain in your own words how the dispute began and what the source of the problem or disagreement is. take care not to start speaking directly to the other party or insult them. focus on yourself and your own feelings rather than speculating on the motivation or intent of anyone else involved in the dispute. when the other parties are talking  listen to their statements with respect and an open mind. the point of mediation is to reach a compromise  not to  win.     as the mediation begins  the mediator will work with you and the other party to take care of any small  peripheral issues on which you can both agree. generally  it s easier to reach a compromise if you can start on common ground.the mediator may have identified some common goals just from listening to your opening statements. if there are smaller issues that are fairly easy to resolve  the mediator may work with everyone together to settle those things and get them off the table so you can concentrate on the major issues at the core of the dispute.    in the next stage of the mediation  the mediator typically has a series of private caucuses with you and the other party in an attempt to get to the heart of the dispute and find out what the real issues between you are.because you are no longer in the same room with the others  you have the opportunity to be completely open and honest with the mediator without fear of antagonism. the mediator typically will present various options to you and talk about some of the underlying emotions and fears at the heart of the inheritance dispute. you may face some difficult questions during these private caucuses  but keep in mind that anything said in that room is confidential. if the mediator is going to take anything back to the other party  they ll tell you first exactly what they re going to say and get your approval. private caucuses also are an opportunity to brainstorm various alternatives that could lead to compromise. for example  you may be angry because it appears you were disinherited since your name never appeared in the will  and perhaps you suspect foul play on the part of someone who was caring for the deceased person toward the end of their life. however  there may be specific items in which you have a particular interest  such as your grandmother s wedding ring. if the other party is willing to provide that item to you  the situation can be resolved.    when the mediator feels you and the other party are in positions where you are close to reaching a compromise  you typically will return to one table to hash out the details of the resolution face to face.keep in mind it may take more than one session to reach this point  particularly if someone digs in their heels and refuses to give up on something. generally  the mediator will only bring you all back together once everyone has indicated that they are committed to reaching a mutually agreeable resolution of the issue. the mediator can t force you to accept anything you don t want  but you need to keep an open mind and understand that it may not be possible for you to come out on top. as with any compromise  typically each party wins a little and loses a little.    since mediation itself is non binding  any compromise you reach must be put in writing and signed by both parties. this contract then becomes binding and legally enforceable in a court of law.typically the mediator will write up an outline of the terms of your agreement and then present that outline to all parties to make sure it accurately reflects the compromise you reached. once the specifics of the compromise are established  the mediator may write up the formal agreement. if there s an attorney present  he or she also may have a hand in writing it up. regardless of who writes up the final agreement  read it carefully and make sure you understand it and that it accurately reflects the compromise you reached before you sign it. keep in mind that once all parties have signed the agreement  it becomes a legally binding contract that must be followed.

query	11	know who do the spoof  spoofing attack make a funny movie spoof  with the possible exception of mel brook s space balls  which took aim almost exclusively at star wars   a mega hit that almost everyone has seen   almost all great spoofs cast their net widely. it is no mistake that brook s other films hit bigger targets like monster movies  young frankenstein   westerns  blazing saddles  and historical epics  history of the world pt. 1 . the master of spoof and parody understood that the more people feel included  and the more people understand broader references  the funnier the film will be.   movies and genres that tend to take themselves very seriously tend to be the best targets of satire. generally  the more a movie or genre tries to avoid humor  the riper it is for making fun of.genre movies are those with similar plots    any type of movie you ve seen 10 versions of  like slasher films  romantic comedies  sports films  etc.    a great spoof pays attention to the  original  and uses it as the jumping off point for the screenplay  and you need to do your research. watch both the movies and any other related spoofs  noting what they find humor in and where things are ripe for joking. some things to pay attention to are recurring character types  is the cast usually a variation on the same 3 characters  if so  you ll need to include parody versions of them  too.  common cliches and story arcs  are their plot moments  lines  or shots that every single movie has in common  how can you subvert them to make them funny   themes or issues of the genre  what does the movie seem to address  is it over the top action and adrenaline in cop movies  spoofed in the other guys   or self righteous documentaries   spoofed in the series documentary now   .     there are few movies without plot holes  and most things you re spoofing will be full of them. instead of shying away  expose these plot holes to comical extremes  pointing out places the  original  film got a little too ahead of itself. again  remember that broader plots  like how horror movie characters always want to  split up   are easier to spoof than one plot point in one specific movie. most spoofs basically steal the common plot structure from the movie they parody  using this as the framework to make jokes from.   having the characters acknowledge the issue or problem  or have one character in particular who jokes about the plot hole  like the stoner in house in the woods .  forcing  the plot on the characters  for example  the character accidentally becomes the classic hero or saves the day  despite trying not to be involved  or not trying at all . resolve the plot holes in a ridiculous way  blazing saddles does this with great skill   or simply cut to the aftermath of the big moment without explaining how everyone made it through  like anchorman s quick turnaround on will ferrell cleaning up and putting on a fresh suit in under two seconds.    one of the best examples of this  spoiler alert   is in the medieval spoof monty python and the holy grail  where the film ends with king arthur and his knights getting arrested by modern day cops in the midst of an enormous battle    it turns out the whole movie is just adults playing violent dress up. surprise is at the root of all comedy  and spoofs are the perfect place for a surprise    your audience knows what plot point or reveal is expected based on the original movie or genre. shake it up    inverted characters are always a great spoof tactic   from bumbling  expert  cops in the naked gun to the intelligent  kickass sidekick in the green hornet remake.    this is spinal tap  a parody of rock documentaries  takes this joke almost literally in the infamous  11  speech  where a guitarist brags that his amp s volume knobs go all the way up to 11  not just 10 like a normal amp. spoofs gain humor by exposing how ridiculous the ideas and plots of movies really are  and how far off they are from the real world.    the greatest parodies  almost without fail  still manage to respect and honor the movies they are spoofing. the do this by remembering what made the movies so special and worth of parody. after all  no one spoofs a movie that no one watched in the first place. this can mean expanding on the themes or the film  like in sean of the dead  or simply picking out the most popular elements and playing them up highly  like in austin power.sean of the dead begins the film with a zombie like walk to and from work  then repeats the same shot after a zombie infestation occurs. the main character doesn t notice anything different the second time  a comical moment that reinforces the idea that we re all zombies sometimes    an important theme that plays out up until the very ending.  austin powers follows a typical spy plot  but its longevity comes from its recognition of what makes the spy movies so fun    traveling the globe  crazy fashion and gadgets  and lots of beautiful women.    in comedy  the straight man is the person who most represents the viewer. they are the only ones who seem to realize how insane or crazy things are around them  which makes the craziness and spoofing around them all the funnier. think of simon pegg s tightly wound cop in the police parody  hot fuzz   or michael bluth  in arrested development. while a bit of an advanced skill  peppering in the  voice of reason  will make all of the ridiculous stuff sound normal by comparison.   the straight man can be a parody as well  and it is usually best when they are    the main character of airplane  is a war pilot coming back to face  calm  normal life as a civilian pilot. but  if you ve seen any disaster movie ever  you know it won t be so easy.  a funny spoof needs to be a funny movie all on its own  and constant references to other films will get old fast. let yourself cut loose and just be funny  even if the joke doesn t have a  cousin  in the real movies. open  original jokes will make the film feel less like a rip off  or one of those widely panned spoofs where every joke is simply a reference to things that happen in other movies.   use your references to add a layer of humor  not to supply all the jokes. check austin powers  for example. dr. evil is a great parody of common spy villains  but things like his relationship with his less evil son transcend parody to become great family comedy in any movie. this makes the son s turn towards evil even funnier later on  as the parody aspects come full circle. one of the funniest scenes in will ferrel s telenovela parody casa de mi padre is a take on the cowboy singalong  but as the musical continues it veers into wildly different  and hilarious  new territory based on the image of them all singing.  for example  any spoof of the blair witch project should be using hand held camera work to replicate the shaky look of the original. shooting a game of thrones parody  you better have lots of low camera angles on the power players and dramatic  sweeping shots of your location  which can humorously reveal things as you turn the camera .   not all movies have an easily discernible visual style  but they all have common pieces. while romantic comedies are shot in a straightforward manner  you definitely need a  happy music  montage of the couple falling in love. the other idea is to go as far from the actual movie as possible  shooting instead in a comically different location  like the aforementioned ending of the holy grail.     the best spoofs play off of the original movies from script to stage  and your actors are a key factor. show them the characters they are spoofing in their  natural habitat  so they everyone is on the same page. find the major motivation or parody of the character   the pompous hero    the bumbling sidekick    use these characters as baselines  especially for big moments. instead of starting from scratch on a rakish  sleazy pirate ship captain  you can say  act like han solo  but way creepier and more flirty.     looking at the camera  laughing  or acknowledging that this isn t how things normally are is called  breaking the 4th wall.  you re basically reminding everyone that they re watching a movie  which can work in small doses  see the film noir spoof kiss kiss  bang bang for a wonderful example   but most jokes should be told  straight.  that means your actors accept the lines and events as if they were real life. to your characters  the world they live in is the only world they know  no matter how wacky.   check leslie nielsen  star of famous spoofs from  airplane   to  the naked gun  for a masterclass in straight faced comedy.  it may seem counter intuitive to ape the movie you re making fun of  but this level of detail will make the jokes far funnier. great spoofs could  at quick glance  be the very movies they are making fun of. this sucks the audience in. the surprise of your twists and jokes are much funnier because they are juxtaposed against a more  serious  backdrop.    the tv show community s now famous action movie spoof   modern warfare   had more visual jokes than most full length spoofs. from the general  such as a trickle of green paint sliding ominously down the wall  spoofing blood  to a character s slow mo dives  flips  and machine gun fire calling up images of the matrix and scarface. an attention to visual humor will wring out a lot of laughs.   adjust and play with your props. making a fantasy spoof  try changing the emblems on the shields or coat of arms to something ridiculous or funny.don t be afraid to  steal  famous shots and do something funny with them.  airplane   begins with the plane cutting through the clouds set to the music from jaws  re creating the shot in a new light.  this seems counter intuitive  but remember the old rule of  tragedy   time   comedy.  if you put your characters in somewhat legitimate danger  introduce real consequences  and live in the world you re spoofing  then it will be that much funnier when everything blows up in the character s faces. a good spoof still respects and pays attention to the classics  and is a better movie for it.   while any movie in this article could fit this step  sean of the dead is a particularly good example. it actually owns up the horror elements in a few key scenes  playing like a traditional zombie movie  which leads to an enormously funny and satisfying payoff in the end.  comedy  in general  is a quick moving art form  as surprise and speed are key to getting laughs and stringing them together. spoofs are often even faster because they rarely have original plots that the audience needs to think of. try to keep the jokes rolling quickly    if one fails  there is another one right behind it    and let the plot stay simple.   most spoofs are on the shorter end  usually 90 100 minutes  as there is always a danger of the movie overstaying its welcome if it doesn t have anything original to say.  
query	12	use on fabric spray painting spray paint your sofa  obviously  if you already have a dingy  past its used by date sofa hanging around that you re just about to toss  it ll be the ideal candidate. just be sure to ask all those invested in the sofa if it s okay to change its look.  you ll probably find everyone is in agreement with either changing it or ditching it provided they don t have to do the work  it s also a good idea to agree on the new color you ll spray paint the sofa before going ahead  ask your spouse  housemates or anyone else affected for their thoughts on preferred colors. if you re the only one in the house who really cares about color matching though  you re probably clear to get going. one other thing  this article is concerned with fabric covered sofas. you ll have to find a different option for leather  polyester or vinyl covered sofas  which will need different treatment and coverings because they are generally paint resistant.   the sofa doesn t have to be one in your home. maybe you saw a fantastic sofa down the local thrift store going for a song but hated the color or feel it needs sprucing up. don t hold back.  the spray paint solution might be just the motivation needed to go ahead and buy that old couch. if you want to change a new sofa s color  be sure everyone agrees with the move. people who love the new sofa are bound to be rather more touchy about changing its look while it s still in great condition. one way to test the suitability of a couch for painting is to add a drop of water. where the water sinks into the couch  it will usually be fine to spray paint. on the other hand  if the water beads up  it ll probably resist the addition of paint.          it s a good idea to keep the color change as simple as possible because it s a lot of effort to spray paint a sofa and any deviation from one simple color will increase the effort and challenge. the color should be either neutral or one that fits in with your existing decor. neutral colors have the advantage of being open to any color addition by way of cushions  etc. if you do want to paint the sofa more than one color  for example  say wide stripes or differently colored seat cushions from the rest of the sofa   be sure to match the colors well.  for a fabric sofa  you ll need special industrial fabric paint able to cover the sofa evenly and can handle the sofa fabric. don t use the usual spray paints sold in a hardware store  the end effect will be a crunchy  flaky sofa that nobody will dare sit on. instead  choose specially formulated sofa fabric spray paint  available from craft store and furniture renovation stores. the retailer will be able to assist you with questions about particular brands and colors.   make sure the paint is formulated for the same fabric type used on your sofa. check to see if the paint can lists sofas or couches as one of the compatible fabrics  as not all fabric paint works well on sofas. if it doesn t specify a sofa  talk directly to the retailer or even the manufacturer of the paint. sending an email to the manufacturer can be a good way of getting some certainty. you might also get away with adding a textile medium to an acrylic or latex paint  the addition of a textile medium can make the standard paint more flexible for use on fabric than it would otherwise be.in this case  you ll need to roll on the paint or use a paintbrush rather than spray painting the sofa.    it s a really good idea to steam clean the sofa  or even to have it professionally cleaned  before proceeding. this will remove stains  pieces of stuck on food  fluff and any other accumulated debris  giving you the artist s proverbial clean canvas. if you look for special deals  you can often get a good price for a professional to come around and clean the sofa  if all the carpets need a cleaning  ask for a deal on adding the sofa in too.   as well as cleaning  take this opportunity to repair rips and gouges in the sofa. these won t disappear post painting and will continue to widen with the pressure of sitting. if you feel capable  mend the tears yourself with industrial strength thread  or have a professional seamstress or furniture repairer come by to fix them. avoid the duct tape solution  it may seem bright at the time but it ll ease its way off and create even larger tears as it does so.       if you need to replace springs  start considering whether the cost is worth the effort versus a new sofa. if you can get the springs fixed and keep the costs down  then repair may be a good option  otherwise it might be better to get the sofa recycled and start anew.       remove the cushions from the couch to be sprayed separately or completely recovered in new fabric that matches the paint. cover the part under the cushions with a sheet adhered with painter s tape so that it won t get sprayed too.       cover every part of the couch you don t want to spray paint with painter s tape masking tape  such as the wooden legs  wooden edging  wooden armrests  whatever. if you re doing more than one color  you ll need to cover all parts not getting sprayed that color with a drop cloth that is neatly taped to a perfect edge next to the area to be sprayed. absolutely everything you do not want spray painted must be covered to protect it.          you re going to be spray painting  which means that you need to be somewhere that paint can drift without affecting surrounding items and you ll need excellent ventilation  lack of ventilation when working with paint fumes can make you feel woozy and sick and can even harm your health . the garage  an outdoor driveway  a large room  etc. are probably ideal places  with rooms and the garage  be sure to keep open all windows and doors  if the area has a fan  use it to draw out the paint fumes. just be aware that if painting outdoors  you ll either need perfectly dry  sunny weather over a week or so  or you ll need to keep bringing the sofa indoors to dry  as each layer requires several days to dry before the next layer can be added.   use plenty of drop sheets to cover everything in the area  drifting paint will land on items and potentially stain them. cover walls  the floor and fittings as well as furnishings. old sheets can be found in thrift stores if you don t have your own. drop cloths are sold at most hardware stores and are very affordable and are usually reusable again and again.       set up a station for the paint  rags  brushes  for fine corner work   paint thinner and anything else needed. keep this within reach of the sofa workspace.  the paint thinner helps if you make a mistake  you can simply wipe off the paint quickly with the thinner on a rag.           as well as ventilation  you might consider wearing a respiratory mask to avoid breathing in the paint fumes. wearing gloves is a good idea too  to prevent stains on your skin and be sure to wear old clothes and shoes  as you will end up getting paint all over them. tie back any long hair to protect it and consider wearing goggles to protect your eyes from stray paint.    you can always test the paint colors out on an unseen part of the sofa first  to see how the color takes and what it feels like. it s recommended that you do this before spraying the whole sofa and finding out you can t stand the end result. head around to the sofa s backside and spray a little where no one can see.   as well as color  check for compatibility of the paint with the sofa. check that it dries evenly  doesn t rub off after drying and looks okay. drizzle a little water on the painted test spot after drying  then rub a white or light cloth over it to see if the paint stays in place. if any paint comes off  the paint brand is not appropriate with the sofa fabric and you ll need to try another one  you don t want clothes and skin stains caused by the newly painted sofa.          in each case  spray paint a thin base coat first  allow it to dry  then add more coats  always aiming for an even consistency overall. wipe off any drips quickly  or use a brush to smooth them into the remaining paint evenly.  use a fine paintbrush for easing the spray paint into corners  into fabric details or over ridges into dents in the fabric that the spray paint might either miss or not cover evenly. if hairs come off a paintbrush used for detailed corner work  remove immediately as these will look unprofessional if they dry onto the sofa.    continue to be on the safe side and start with the back of the sofa. begin at the top and spray paint thin  even lines  overlapping as you move downward. this initial coat may look streaky and thin but that s okay  because you re actually laying down the foundation for subsequent coats.   don t worry if couch patterns or colors are still visible after painting. remember that dark spray paint colors may cover patterns or old colors quicker than lighter colors. you may need to do more passes with a lighter spray paint color.          then move to the arms and the front of the sofa  each time painting as in the previous step to achieve a base coat of paint. then  if you are spray painting the cushions  do these separately  they will need to be turned over  so this can take a while to allow the painted sides to dry enough before painting the unpainted sides .   it may be a better option to recover the cushions in a fabric that matches the paintwork on the sofa. this gives you the opportunity to throw in some contrasting patterns or textures and it s a lot easier to cover cushion rectangles or squares than it is to cover the whole couch with fabric.    this time is essential to determine that the couch color works for you and that the paint is adhering properly to the sofa fabric. after three days  rub the paint with a white towel to make sure the paint has dried and bonded to the sofa fabric. the base coat will give you a good idea of whether this type of paint and or color is right for your couch.    as outlined above  methodically spray paint each part of the couch until the sofa has a second layer. each time you spray paint a layer  add one layer at a time  waiting a few days in between coats. while this probable seems like a long  drawn out process  it s the only way to guarantee a decent final outcome.   in each case  aim for consistency of the coats. avoid spraying on too much paint each layer  aim for a smooth  consistent look.    the final appearance is a matter of personal taste. just be sure to avoid spraying too much paint on or the couch may feel like a crunchy papier m ch  project to sit on  in many cases  only one layer more will be needed over the base layer.   after you re satisfied with the paint outcome  rub the couch down with a white towel to remove any napping fabrics or paint clumps.    sit down with your friends  a fine drink and a favorite movie to give it a trial run. if your friends are attentive  you might even get a compliment   image spray paint your sofa step 14   version 2.jpg

query	15	remember back to the future go back in time  when you travel at speeds approaching the speed of light  time slows down for you relative to the outside world. if you could travel faster than the speed of light  the time dilation would technically allow you to reach your destination before you even have left  effectively traveling back in time. unfortunately  the speed of light is the ultimate stop sign in the universe. by the rules of einstein s special relativity  it takes an infinite amount of energy to accelerate a slower than light object to the speed of light the faster you go  the more massive you become and the more energy it takes to accelerate your further. traveling faster than light would require technology we don t have yet  and that is likely impossible.  relativity does technically allow for faster than light particles called tachyons  but there is no evidence that tachyons exist  or that they could be used to transmit meaningful information  like you  if they did.    wormholes are theoretical warps in the fabric of reality that connect two points of space time by a shorter distance than they are separated by in the larger continuum. wormholes could connect distant galaxies  separate universes  and even different times. much like traveling faster than light  however  the practicalities of stable wormhole creation and travel likely make this option impossible.   ideas in quantum physics suggest that our universe is full of wormholes tiny ones smaller than atoms that form and collapse in the briefest instants at the level of reality s quantum foam. harnessing and expanding one to a size humans could move through  however  might cause a feedback loop that collapses the wormhole before you could use it for time travel.    if you really have to go back in time but haven t found a way to overcome the practical problems of faster than light travel or wormhole creation  you could travel forward in time to a far future out of reach of your natural lifetime. perhaps in the future  people will have developed advanced technologies that make backward time travel possible  and you can convince them to send you back to your historical destination. under the laws of physics  travel into the future is much more achievable than travel into the past.   take a trip at speeds near the speed of light. special relativity predicts that if you travel at near light speed  time will slow down for you relative to slower frames of reference. so if you spend a few years zooming away from the earth and back  you will return to find that more years have passed on earth than have passed for you. freeze yourself in suspended animation. though the technology has hardly been perfected  it may be possible to freeze a human body and thaw it many years later unchanged and un aged. if you could make yourself such a time capsule  you could last beyond your lifetime and awaken in an age far into the future.    you don t need a wormhole to take a walk down memory lane. instead  travel to the past using your memories. long term memories can be hard to dig up at first  but with a little stimulus you will soon start remembering vivid details and recalling long forgotten emotions from days gone by. you ll feel like you are traveling back in time  even if your body stays in the present.    your former neighborhood  your primary school  your old church  the site of your first job  places you took memorable vacations. even if these places have changed a lot  you will still start to remember details about them and your time there. try to remember what each room was for  the people you saw in each house  the colors and details of the buildings.   these can be college or high school friends  or even earlier friends if you can get in touch with them. go with them to visit your old haunts and talk about everything you had lived together before you separated. if you haven t seen this person in a long time  meet in the last place you saw each other.    photos can be a great way to rekindle your lost days. take a deep look into your albums whenever you want to revisit your past life. take out any memorable objects you kept from your past and examine them  hold them in your hand  try to think about where you got them and how you used them.    smells are very evocative for triggering memories. if you never applied a distinctive scent  try to find a scent that one of your loved ones once applied.    maybe you re a bit embarrassed about your childhood musical tastes  but if there are songs you haven t heard in many years  listening to them again can be a great way to feel like you are back in the past. try finding them on youtube.    don t worry if you don t remember the rules exactly. find the games that made you the happiest as a child  and give them another shot. you ll be surprised at the memories that they can bring back.    once you get the time travel train going  keep the ball rolling by writing down every detail that comes to mind.  
query	16	love that movie braveheart have a movie night with friends  the last thing you want is to invite people over and then spend all the time arguing about what to watch. before people arrive  plan what to watch  or at least have it narrowed down to a few options. this will save time and make the night more enjoyable.if you have a specific movie that you want to show  it s good to tell people when you invite them what movie you ll be watching. this way they already know what to expect when they show up.    if you love movies  you most likely have a few that you know other people have missed out on. take this chance to show your friends how great it is. you may have to check ahead of time and ask if they have seen it  so have a few in mind in case your first choice doesn t work out.you still want to make sure the movie is something that people will enjoy. if your favorite film is a silent german art piece  maybe your friends are not into that. find the balance between something that s underrated and something none of your friends want to see. with this option  you ll probably have to tell them ahead of time what movie you re picking  or you might end up with something they ve all seen.    you want everyone to be on board with the movie choice as much as possible. give everyone the options ahead of time and let them vote on what they want. or have them submit a choice to you and use those as the voting options.   you are still the host  so you have the final say in what to watch. give people the chance for input as much as you can  but set a cut off point when you ll make the final decision.    if you ll be hosting all guys or all girls  consider what they ll enjoy most. if kids will be present  make sure the movie is appropriate. try to pick a movie that fits your common interest  which might be sports  remember the titans   music  begin again   business  the big short   or martial arts  the raid  redemption .picking something you ve never seen is great when you re alone  but it may not be the best plan for inviting people. you might end up with something you don t even like. if you don t know what type of movies people like  this is when it s good to gather their input ahead of time.    when you have time for multiple movies  pick a fun set of sequels  movies with the same leading actor  or movies with similar content. watch your favorite actor across multiple decades  or let a few people showcase their favorite old sci fi movie.the combinations you come up with are endless. you might even choose a set of movies where the theme isn t obvious and the audience has to figure out the connection by the end of the last movie. the connection can be as specific or general as you want. you might watch two different version of the king kong story  or you might pick two movies that were simply released in the same year. you can find some connection between most movies if you try hard enough.    to make the night a big event  you could design tickets that feature the date of the movie night  the title of the movie  and the person s name who you are inviting. this will raise your movie night above hanging out and make it into a special occasion.you can mail them out ahead of time to invite people  or you can hand them out in person as you see people. just to make it fun  tell everyone that they must have their ticket to be able to enter the movie showing. but let them in even if they forget the ticket     rather than sticking to the living room  find a creative location to watch the movie. moving outdoors can be a fun option. scary movies are great in the basement or attic. you could set up in the garage for racing movies or a bedroom for romantic movies.   the location you choose should relate to the movie in some way  or it probably isn t worth the trouble of setting it up. watching interstellar under the stars would be amazing  but watching training day in the bedroom probably wouldn t have much effect. make sure the location you choose is good and comfortable for movie watching. you don t want to get attacked by bugs outside or freeze in an unheated garage. make the proper adjustments when moving to these locations.    depending on the size of the room where you ll show the movie  you will most likely need to bring in some extra folding chairs  pillows and blankets for those sitting on the floor  or even move in a couch from another room.it s best to have all of this done before people arrive so that no one feels like you are going to a lot of trouble for them. you ll need an idea of how many people are coming so you can set up the seating accurately. check all of the seating to make sure that people will be able to see the tv  or projector screen . sit in all of the spots to make sure the view is good. if you only have a small amount of room to work with  make sure you don t invite so many people that it begins to feel cramped.    movies and snacking go hand in hand  so make sure you have a great spread. you could ask people to bring something or provide it all yourself. make sure you have plates and napkins to keep the mess to a minimum. check with all of your guests about any food allergies or diet restrictions beforehand.classic movie snacks like popcorn  candy  and soda are always good options. but you could also have more filling foods like a sandwich bar  french fries  or meatballs. include some healthy options like fruit  vegetables  and cheese. it s good to have a wide range of drinks such as soda  juice  water  and alcohol  if the party is just for adults . make sure you have a trash can set out in plain sight so people can throw their trash away. another way to make things fun is to have snacks that go along with the movie. donuts for a cop movie  fish sticks for an ocean adventure  or even something fancy for a cooking movie.    you could decorate to the theme of the movie by using halloween stuff for scary movies  jerseys and pennants for sports movies  or props and characters from the movie itself. you can put out some simple decorations or give the viewing room a whole makeover.   you could lay out a red carpet and set up a marquee like it s a big movie premiere. if you want to go more elaborate  you could stage the room to look like the main set of the movie or a significant scene. any amount of decorating that makes it look like more than your living room will give the evening a special feel.    watching with all the lights on may make moving around easier  but watching in a darkened room creates the best ambiance. if shutting all the lights off makes it too dark  consider setting up a few dim lamps  or string christmas lights around the room.   if you ll watch in a room that has lights on a dimmer switch  this is perfect because you can dim them right as the movie starts.    movie nights are meant to be fun  so don t get carried away with enforcing rules  but ask everyone at the start to keep their phones put away. it s usually more fun to all be focused on the movie together rather than everyone looking at their phones.announce this at the start of the movie  but don t make it sound like you are trying to be strict. just say it will be more fun for everyone if there are no phones out distracting people from the movie.    you can plan ahead of time to take an intermission halfway through  like old movies or plays. this gives everyone time to check their phones for anything important  use the bathroom  and load up on another round of snacks.   keep the intermission to a time limit so that it doesn t stretch on too long. 10 minutes is probably sufficient for people to move around and take care of their business.    people who love movies usually love to sit and discuss them after they watch. you could plan some specific questions ahead of time  or just let things go with the flow. since you are the host  you should open the discussion to get people engaged.   for example  you could ask people what they thought of the protagonist  was he or she likeable or annoying  you could ask if anyone picked out a certain theme the filmmakers were trying to establish throughout the movie.

a different time to spend together.    knowing what kinds of activities your daughter enjoys will help greatly when you spend time together because you ll know what to do and where to go. observe your child sometimes  but not too often  to see what they are doing. they might be on the computer  tv  drawing  reading  or playing outside. look more into what she is doing  though  to get more clues into what she likes. if she is reading  ask her what she is reading. if she is watching tv  ask her what she is watching  and if she is on the computer or outside  ask her what she is playing. you ll get a better feel for what she likes  and when you ask  she ll feel glad that you are interested in what she is doing. her interests may be very different from yours  but don t try to change what she likes and dislikes.   try to learn more about your daughter s interests yourself  and do things relating to those activities. if she likes reading  for example  read together at home or spend an afternoon at the library. if she likes soccer  play a game or two in your backyard or the park. if your daughter likes painting or drawing  take her to an art museum.    if there s one thing that will

restaurant  museum  or amusement park. now that you know your daughter s interests  you can start to know where she might want to go. like stated before  pick somewhere that she would like. take your baseball lover to her favorite team s game  or an artist to the arts and crafts store. another important factor is the weather. check online  on tv  or in the newspaper for details on the weather.

daughter  no matter the weather. make a snow fort  have a snowball fight  make snow angels  or make a snowman. if your daughter likes sports  go skiing  sledding  or snowboarding. and don t fret if it s raining. go to a movie theater  a restaurant  an indoor pool  the library  museum  really anywhere indoors.    this is a great activity if it s raining out. watching movies can also really bring you closer. look through your movies together and find one that you and your daughter want to watch. make sure it is appropriate for her age  funny family movies are good for all ages and will always make you and her smile. there are still other choices  though. some movies you and your daughter might like are pretty in pink  drop dead fred  and my girl. if you don t have good movies at home  go to a theater and see one. another good choice is to watch tv. you can find a tv show that the both of you would like  and make sure you have time to watch it. it will most likely come on at the same time every day  which will be good for your schedule. if neither of you are home at the time  record the tv show.    as a mom  it s important that you should support your daughter in her education. always try to help her with homework if she asks for it. don t give her the answer  help her. for example  if she is struggling on a math problem  don t just say  32 . say   you have to           while still having her interact. go through the steps with her  for example   then you multiply. what is 9 times 13   so she ll know what to do next time. also try to help her if she doesn t ask for it  but you get a hint that she needs help. if she s been doing homework for a long time  ask her if she needs any help she can always come to you. same with if your daughter got a poor grade on a test.   make learning fun. turn studying for a spelling or vocab test into a game of jeopardy. or  have your daughter be the teacher  teaching you about it. study with her. there might be an important test coming up  so it s your job to help her study. she ll probably tell you what to do e.g. give me the word and i ll say the definition.    another way to interact with your daughter is through playing a great game. have a game night with the two of you on a certain day  or just ask her if she d like to play a game. some good family games you might want to play are sorry  monopoly  life  scrabble  taboo  and snakes and ladders  but you could really play any game. card games are also fun. play bluff  war  go fish  or uno if you have a spare deck.    another fun way for the two of you to bond is through cooking or baking. it s also a good way to start teaching them how to cook if they are older. bring out some cookbooks and look through them with your daughter to see what to make. you can make cookies  a cake  cupcakes  cookies  brownies  or any dessert. you could also make your own bread or bagels  make a tart  crisp  smoothies  soup  stew  or even your own ice cream    remember that you are cooking together. let your daughter do some things  like cracking eggs  helping whisk the batter  pouring liquids  and decorating. expect things to not be done perfectly   this is how children and teens learn. however  do not let her use the oven until you believe she is mature and responsible enough to deal with working around heat on her own  by the same token  don t mollycoddle her forever   children should be able to deal with cooking with heat around the age of 11 or 12 .    of course  your daughter already knows that you love her  but do you really show it  although playing a game or watching tv is spending time together  is it really quality special time  you may not know how to do this  but it s the little things that count. go for a nice walk together  talk  and enjoy the nature. cheer her up on a bad day with a hug or a small gift  like a book or a stuffed animal. give encouraging messages often  like  you can do it    i believe in you   or  you are a very talented artist swimmer soccer player  . be sure to praise her efforts above all  as it is important to let her know that it is in the trying and the doing  including learning to deal with failure  that she is going to succeed in life. with support from you  she ll be left with a positive attitude. laugh and smile with her.    it s important for your daughter to know that she can always come and talk to you if she needs anything. when you talk to your daughter  make sure that you look at her  and she does the same. tell her   i need you to listen  but in a calm  friendly way. try to stay short and sweet  or your daughter will get bored  not focus  and think that they are in trouble or being lectured. leave the key point for the first sentence  and keep it simple  using non confusing and or shorter words. you should also occasionally talk casually. when the two of you talk  it shouldn t all be serious. talk about school e.g. what s going on in school  how was school today  but  you should also go deeper than that. ask her about her future  sports  or hobbies.    not only should your daughter listen to you  but you must listen as well. if you don t  she ll think it s okay to not pay attention  also be aware that children know when their parent isn t truly listening and it isn t a pleasant feeling because it is dis empowering. to listen  stop what you are doing to look at her. have good eye contact with each other so you can listen. to show that you are listening  ask her questions that you have. also  paraphrase. paraphrasing is putting something in your own words. say  for example   so you re saying          or  you mean that            so you can clarify what your daughter just said to you.   listen to what she wants to do. for example  if your daughter wants to go to a movie  don t just say  no  right away. see what you can do  look at what movies are playing  or ask her what movie she wants to see. you might not want to do it  but once in a while you should let your daughter get her way.    you need to always be there  whether it s through presence at an important event  advice  or by words of encouragement. if there is a sports  musical  school  or any important event that your daughter wants you to attend  really try to see if you can go. if not  see why. try to cancel whatever it is that s on the same day  but some things you absolutely cannot miss  so be sure to tell your daughter. but it s okay if you can t actually be present at an event. there are lots of more ways to be there for your daughter.   offer help. if you see your daughter struggling in anything  like school  sports  or an instrument  help her. listen to her play her flute  contact the teacher or help with her schoolwork  or play basketball with her.  be encouraging. it may be hard for her to do something  so you must cheer her on and use encouraging words and actions. say  good job  when you truly mean it  and maybe get her a gift that says  way to go    such as a book. compliment her. say  for instance   that s a nice shirt  or  i like what you did to your room .    this is another form of encouragement  and it will make your daughter feel so happy inside when you recognize her talents. ask her if she would like to try out for a school play  strings solo  or softball team inside or outside of school  but don t be forceful   and she might agree. see if you can get her into a class or team  too. another thing to do is to participate in the activity she s trying out elsewhere. play a game or soccer  hold a concert at home  or have her teach you some dance moves. it will make her feel great  you ll learn something new  and the two of you will bond more.    this may go without saying  but your kindness has a huge impact on your relationship together. don t yell at her right away when things don t go accordingly. instead  remain calm and nice when explaining that she has done something you don t like or don t want her to do again. try saying   i want you to do this  or  please do this  instead of  do this  or  do this now . she s more likely to do what you say  anyway  if you address her kindly. moreover  give real reasons  not just  because i said so.  she will be more responsive if she realizes there are dangers  social pressure or poor health outcomes etc. likely to occur as a result of certain choices she makes. also  hug and kiss her before she goes to bed  or in the morning before she leaves  always end everything on a good note.   respect her. she is an individual  and you must remember that. there may be some things about your daughter that you may not quite agree with or understand  but still be respectful  she can have her own opinion.    it may be hard to do this  but you have to be trusting. the reason why you may not trust your daughter is because she might lie often. this may be because you lie. she ll think it s ok to lie if you do  so it s time to start being a good role model for her  and for everyone else . be honest yourself  keep promises  and don t break them. however  if something comes up  be sure to tell her that. say the reason  as she probably would be wondering. when you see your daughter do something responsible  like homework or band practicing  or an a on a test  you can trust her more.   share your feelings. tell your daughter that she can always come to you if she needs to  and that she should be honest. you should share your feelings with her as well. tell your daughter how you really feel about something  and sometimes  you can ask her for advice. also ask her if anything is wrong and how her day was

search for the perfect outfit    pick something that you can easily take off. don t pick something with a thousand unwieldy buttons that will take an hour to remove  or something that s so tight that you need a forklift to remove it from your cleavage. pick something that s sexy  but not so provocative that you leave nothing to the imagination.    your undergarments need to be just as sexy as your actual outfit. pick a bra that makes your cleavage stand out  and tight black underwear or a thong. consider underwear that s lacy or slightly see through.   stockings with garters are a must for a striptease. you can go for classic fishnets  garters with a sexy pattern  or even garters with a racy seam up the back.    choosing a pair of shoes should be simple. the higher and thinner the heel  the better your calves and legs will look. black shoes work best for a strip tease. just make sure that the shoes are something that you can actually walk in. if you bought a new pair for the occasion  break them in a bit first.    your face and hair should look just as sexy as the rest of your outfit. let your hair hang down your back  or pull it in a loose bun that you can unravel during the striptease. your hair should look slightly messy and sexy  but still clean enough for any man to want to run his hands through it.    wear dark shadow that brings out your eyes  black mascara  and a

query	26	come terms of endearment write a letter to a friend of the opposite sex  open communication is key. if your friend is single and looking for a relationship  it is important to know this. likewise  if you or they are in a committed relationship  it is important to know one another s boundaries. if you clearly understand one another s intentions and goals  you can be aware of potential missteps.    according to researchers  men and women share 99  identical genetic code. however  this 1  difference can cause differences in perception and communication. for example  on average  women talk faster and use more words daily. being aware of differences in conversation pace and your volume of words can help bridge a gap between inter gender communication styles. this can also help your friend feel more at ease. a recent study showed men and women viewed their inter gender friendships differently. for example  men are more likely to be attracted to a female friend  and think the attraction is mutual. knowing these perceptual differences can help avoid unwanted advances and create awareness that each friend may potentially view the relationship differently.    if your friend is using language or gestures that make you feel uncomfortable  make sure to tell them. this sort of open communication can do wonders to saving your friendship over the long term.   although you want to communicate open and freely with your friend  be aware that friendships with the opposite sex have added complications  such as potential tension or physical attractions. in order for it to work  both friends need to be aware that you see one another as siblings or good friends and nothing more. do not put anything in your letter that might be suggestive of physical attraction or any other lines that cross friendship lines. avoid flirting. although many guys and girls flirt with one another  for the good of your friendship you should avoid this.    filling one another in on what is happening in your life will not only help you forge a closer friendship  it will also help avoid any miscommunications about your intentions. this sort of exchange also helps build up your friendship and reaffirm the value of platonic involvement in one another s lives.   let them know if you ve met someone special. one way to create an awkward moment is for you to keep a new romance from your friend. let him or her know that you re going on a date  or that you had one that was successful and hope this one will be a keeper. not only does it keep your friend in the loop of your life  but it also cements the notion that you are friends and only that.    you and your friend no doubt have built your relationship on a history of interactions. it will make for a nice letter if you reference things you both have in common  whether it is a hometown  college  or anything else. it will also be helpful in reminding them why your friendship has lasted and show an intimacy only friends can have.    if there are any doubts about your intentions  you can clear them up by communicating why you are happy to be friends. tell them they give great advice  or that you feel comfortable telling them things so that they know what aspects of your friendship you value.   inter gender friendships can have benefits that intra gender friendships do not. you may talk to your girl boy platonic friend about things that girls or guys do not typically talk to one another. for example  maybe you and your guy friends talk a lot about sports  but not feelings. your letter is a chance to focus on things that make your friendship special.    if you have a significant other  try to keep complaints about them to a minimum. while relationship griping is part of a normal friendship  inter gender relationships should be aware of potential implications. your friend may interpret your relationship as unhappy and mistake your availability.if you re having relationship problems  talk to one of your same gender friends about it and leave it out of the letter. if you do talk about it with your friend of the opposite sex  it would be best to do in person where you are less likely to miscommunicate.    language is very important. do not use language that is reserved for relationships such as terms of endearment like  honey   or  dear . also avoid any suggestive or sexual language that may make your friend think you have interests beyond platonic friendship.    after saying hello to your friend  you should be sure to fill your letter with interesting tidbits about your life. this will help keep your friendship strong by creating a bond on involvement in one another s life. be sure to avoid ambiguous language and also ask questions and make comments showing you are interested in their lives.    don t gush or get overly sentimental  even if you are really missing your friend   keep it positive and light.  miss you  buddy   is great. or  xoxo   even  but just make sure you don t leave the letter ambiguous with a sign off of affection that could be interpreted the wrong way.

query	29	watch movie with english subtitle the incredible hulk add subtitles to a movie  if you current dvd does not have certain subtitles  found under the  settings  or  language  headers on the dvd menu  you will not be able to add them without advanced software and equipment. dvd s are protected and cannot be re written  and your dvd player will not be able to add new languages. your computer  however  is a different beast entirely  and you can add any new subtitles you can find to a movie watched on your computer.   if you re watching on a dvd players  try the  titles  or  subtitle  button on your dvd player s remote.    find the folder or movie file in finder or windows explorer. more likely than not it will be a .mov  .avi  or .mp4 file. luckily  you do not need to adjust the movie file at all  however  you will need to find it and link it to a new subtitle file. subtitle files will usually end in the extension .srt  and are simply the words and the times that each title needs to play during the movie.   you need the movie in it s own file  with the .srt file  for it to read the subtitles. some older subtitle files might end in the extension .sub.  go on your favorite search engine and search for the subtitles in your language. if  for example  you want indonesian subtitles for x men  first class  you might search for  x men  first class indonesian subtitles.  the first site you find is likely good enough  as these files are small and not likely to contain viruses.  download an srt. file from a website such as subscene  moviesubtitles  or yifisubtitles. make sure you avoid any pop ups and only download .srt or .sub files. if you feel unsafe on a site  leave and find another.    if the movie is bestmovieever.avi  your subtitle needs to be written as bestmovieever.srt. find you newly downloaded file wherever you put it  often in the  downloads  folder  and make sure you rename appropriately. the .srt file name must be the same name as the movie.  make a new  dedicated folder for you movie if there isn t one already. place the .srt file in the same folder as your movie. this will automatically link them in most video players.   the easiest video player to use is the free vlc player  which handles most file formats.    after clicking captions  click on  add a caption track  and find your .srt file. make sure that you have  caption track  enabled and not  transcript track.  click the  cc  button when watching your video to enable captions.    subtitles are translations  and as anyone who has ever used google translate can tell you  translations are as much an art form as a science. if you re subtitling the scene itself  there are several considerations you need to come up with for each line    what is the goal of the dialog  regardless of the words they use  what feeling is the character trying to get across  this is your guiding principle when translating. how can you fit the subtitled words within the time the character is speaking  some writers will display a few lines of dialogue at once  starting a little early and ending late to give viewers a chance to read everything. how do you handle slang and figures of speech  they often do not translate well  so you ll have to substitute slang or figurative language from your native language. this  however  requires you to look up the meaning of foreign expressions and slang.  sites like dotsub  amara  and universal subtitler let you see the movie while you write out the subtitles  eventually spitting out an .srt file that fits with your movie. while all subtitling sites work differently  they all follow a similar format    choose when the title starts. write the title out. choose when the title disappears. repeat across the movie  marking  complete  when finished. download the .srt file and place it in the same folder as your movie.  you can write out subtitles by hand if you want though the process is greatly expedited by a program. to do so  open up a text editor like window s notepad or apple s textedit  both free and pre installed   and make sure you know the proper format for a subtitle. before beginning  click  save as  and title it after  yourmovie.srt.  then set the encoding to  ansi  for english subtitles and  utf 8  for non english.then write out your titles. each of the following parts goes on its own line  so hit  enter  after each one     the number of a subtitle. 1 would be the first title  2 the second  etc.  the duration of the subtitle. this is written in the format hours minutes seconds milliseconds     hours minutes seconds milliseconds  example  00 01 20 003     00 01 27 592     the text of the subtitle  this is simply what the title will say.  a blank line. leave one blank line before the number of the next title.  this method lets you see the titles as you add them and adjust their placement  color  and style by hand. open your movie file in your favorite film editor  such as premier  imovie  or windows movie maker  and pull the film into your timeline  the work section . from here  click on your programs  titles  menu and choose a style you like. write out your title  drag it on top of the appropriate section of the film  and repeat.   you can right click on a title and copy and paste it to keep your same settings on every title  saving you tons of time. the only drawback to this format is that the movie will need to be saved as a separate file. you will not be able to turn the titles off  as they will now be part of the movie.

everything you have on her  pick the right moments to let her know you care and it ll mean a lot more than having your arm around her for four hours.   giving her a little kiss on the cheek or a squeeze of the hand is another way to be affectionate. if holding hands isn t your thing  you can put your hand on the small of her back when you re walking.    if you want to love your girl  then you

should be there to lift her up  not put her down  and let her know you think she s amazing and capable of anything she puts her mind to. this doesn t mean you have to follow her around and be her cheerleader at all times  she should support you too  but it does mean that you should let her know that you will help her succeed in any way she wants.   sometimes  this may mean just supporting her when she is upset  sad  or confused. you have to be there for her during the good times and the bad.    you don t have to transform your whole personality and start throwing your jacket over puddles

gift. she might say   i can t believe you remembered that   now  that s love.    if you want to love the girl  then you have to be understanding of the fact that she s only human and has flaws  needs  and desires  just like everyone else. you can t expect her to be perfect or to live up to some unreasonable expectations. if she makes a mistake  don t spend weeks being resentful and being dismissive of her. if she flakes on you once  don t sulk about it for days. obviously  if she mistreats you constantly  then you should reevaluate your relationship  but if she has a few bad days here and there  don t act like it s the end of the world.   think about it  maybe she s having a really hard time adjusting to a demanding new job. maybe she s suffering emotionally because her grandmother or mother recently passed away. try to see things from her perspective before you get angry or start a fight.    part of loving a girl is knowing when you should back off a little bit. maybe she s had a bad

s not flirting with some other guy. if you don t smother her  she ll feel your love more  and she ll love the fact that you respect her individuality.   however  it can be tricky. you have to recognize whether she really doesn t need your support  or if she s just saying that because she doesn t want to be a burden. you have to figure this one out on a case by case basis.    if you want to love a girl  then you have to make some romantic gestures to let her know that you really care about her. don t do anything that feels forced or just completely unnatural to you  but make an effort to

some other ways you can be romantic    write her a sweet message in a card just because. make her a delicious home cooked meal. tell her you love her at the right moments. write or recite her a poem. take her dancing. go on a moonlit walk. have an impromptu picnic. take her to a jazz concert. write love notes to her. serenade her with love songs.    if you are used to keeping your thoughts and feelings to yourself  try speaking up more often. maybe you don t open up because that also means opening yourself up to being teased or rejected  but by being more open  your relationship with this girl can become more intimate  and love thrives on intimacy. you don t have to tell her every little thing about yourself right away  but you should work on being more open and telling her things you don t normally tell anyone. this will show her that you love her and that she stands out from the rest.   being open relates to being honest. though you don t have to tell her about how you saw a cute girl walking by that day  you should be as honest as you can without needlessly hurting her. if she s opening up to you a lot and you don t give her a lot to work with  then she may feel like you re not as invested in the relationship. of course  some guys are a lot less open than others  but you should work on being as open as you can with her while still feeling like you re being yourself.

her or text her to check in so she knows you re thinking about her. if she s away for the weekend for something big like a wedding or tournament  make sure to see how it went. let her know that you don t just stop thinking about her the second you re apart.   on the other hand  don t make her feel smothered. if you know she s going to be super busy  you have to be comfortable with letting her do her own thing instead of getting in her way.    sometimes  when she says she doesn t want to talk about it  she really means it. if something bad happened to her  she may just need some time for it to sink in. don t bother her or pry too much if you can tell she s really just not in the mood to talk about it. this can make her more agitated and even less likely to want to talk to you. you may feel like the best way to show your love is to keep bothering her to talk  but sometimes the best way to show your love is just to back away a little bit.    if you want to love a girl  then you have to

happy. it means listening to your girl without interrupting. and it also means picking your battles. you should work on having much more positive interactions than fights  and on letting her know how

live  or really anything that makes you both happy and that you love doing together. while you shouldn t have all of the same interests  you should have at least a few things that you both care about so you can make your love last.   as relationships progress  it s easy for couples to feel like they have nothing in common anymore. that s why it s important to find things that you always love doing together. if both of you are getting sick of one of your favorite interests  don t just drop it. find something to do in its place.    though it s important to find a comfortable routine of doing a few things that you love together  it s equally important to mix things up and to do new things as often as you can. maybe you ve been playing pool together for years  and it s time to switch to darts. maybe you ve been vacationing in tahoe every summer  it could be time to try yosemite. make an effort to do new things together so you can love your girl forever.   be spontaneous. though planning is great  so is taking a surprise last minute trip  or buying tickets to a concert at the last second.    if you want to love your girl  then you have to love her and yourself as individuals. make sure you don t lose sight of who you are as a person and she ll love you even more and see that you love her more for it. if you continue to follow your own interests  spend time with your friends  and do some things apart  you ll actually be loving your girl even more because you ll be showing that you re comfortable enough with your relationship that you don t have to spend every second together.   and make sure she maintains her independence  too. if you re both going out into the world and doing your own thing  you ll have more to talk about when you re together. if you re spending 24 7 together  then you ll quickly run out of things to talk about.    it doesn t matter if you ve been together for 8 or 80 years. you always have to make the effort to tell your girl you love her  whether you just say it  or you write it in a card. never think that you don t have to say  i love you  because your girl should know how you feel. that s just never the case. tell her you love her in the morning  in the evening  or whenever the moment strikes you. just don t let a day go by without saying it.   there s a difference between saying   love you   and   i love you.  make the effort to really say it.    if you want to love a girl  then you have to keep the passion and romance in your relationship alive. even if you re living together or even married  it doesn t mean you have to stop being romantic because you ve been together so long. remember that the chase is never over and that you have to work on setting a romantic mood  making your girl feel special and loved  and taking the time to pay attention to your girl.   stick to your date nights. don t let anything get in the way of that weekly time you spend together. you should both really dress up and go out for a nice  romantic dinner once in a while just to keep your love strong  no matter how busy you are. never stop trying to charm or romance your girlfriend. if you want to make love last  then you should both always continue to make an effort. never interrupt her while she is talking or talk back to her. it is rude and disrespectful.

want him.    this is the most important thing of all. men hate being around a woman who emasculates them  and a good man won t take long to leave such a woman. don t be afraid to help your man feel good about himself. a little known secret is that men are just as insecure as women. if he s with his friends or family be open to opportunities to let your man look like  the man . it will win his love and respect.    let s be real  a good man doesn t desperately need any woman  he would like to meet a good woman. if he s a good man  he will appreciate the compliment to his attractiveness  at

the field  and is up front and honest about it  but you re looking for an exclusive relationship . don t be uncomfortable saying yes  either. if you feel the time is right  believe in your worth and don t worry that you re  giving yourself away.  you respect yourself and you re confident that he ll come back for more  a man who doesn t respect you in the morning never properly respected you to begin with  and a man who doesn t respect your wishes to wait is too impatient to make a good partner. either way  find someone else.    that means apply the same rules to yourself that you d apply to others  including him. real men do in fact notice this  they just don t scream it out. for example  if he tells you he has a girlfriend and things are not working out  stop  and think ladies that this could be a  test  on how you would handle the situation  so stand your ground and cut off communication  hint   golden rule  . second example  if you do want to try finding his ticklish spots  then don t complain one bit if he tries finding yours in return. don t go on about how you  don t need no man   or about  men this  men that  if you don t want him treating you the same way. do  on the

you to one     this means  don t show that you love this person by being near them all the time. they need their space and they need to know that you don t need to follow them everywhere they go. most

joint or shared trust includes all property that belongs to you and your spouse. while you and your spouse can create two individual trusts  this can cause complications with shared assets. a joint trust  however  can dispose of both individual and shared property.    you can use your list to decide how you want to distribute the assets you place in your trust.keep in mind that you don t necessarily want to have all of your property in your trust. if you have retirement or investment accounts that allow you to designate a beneficiary  leave these out of your trust. including them or designating your trust as the beneficiary only adds an unnecessary layer of complication.use your list as you work on your trust so you have a good picture of your total estate and can figure out how you want it distributed.    you will need information such as account numbers and locations to transfer title in your assets from yourself to the trust.you also want to make sure that you have accurate information about your property in your trust documents.    the people you want to inherit your assets when you die will become beneficiaries of your trust.if you ve included children as beneficiaries  you also should name someone to manage that property for them until they reach adulthood. you also should consider naming alternate or back up beneficiaries in case your primary beneficiary is either unavailable or refuses to take the trust property.    while you are alive  you will be the trustee of your trust. however  someone else will have to take over after you die to distribute the trust s assets.most people choose a spouse or adult child as their successor trustee. you also may want to choose a back up in case the person you ve chosen as a successor has predeceased you or is otherwise unavailable or incapable of taking on the trustee s duties. talk to the person you choose before you draft your documents  and make sure he or she is able and willing to be your successor trustee. you may want to name an additional alternate successor in case the person you name is unavailable or incapable of acting as trustee.you can name a bank or trust company to manage your trust after your death as well  but keep in mind there probably will be fees involved. unlike with a will  your successor trustee doesn t have to live in the same state as you  or the state where your real property is located. for this reason  trusts often are preferred if you want a friend or relative who lives out of state to distribute your property after your death.    although generally you can make a simple living trust by yourself  you may need assistance if you have complex or significant assets.you also may be able to buy a book or use an online trust preparation service  either of which typically cost less than  100. however  if you hire an attorney to prepare your trust documents for you  expect to pay upwards of  1 000. keep in mind you can always draft your documents and then have an attorney look over them to make sure you ve met your intent. typically attorneys charge less to review documents than they would to prepare them. each state has its own requirements for creating a living trust. while most forms will be sufficient  an experienced estate planning attorney licensed in your state will be able to determine immediately if your trust documents meet your state s requirements.    if you want to draft your trust documents yourself  you should be able to find free templates or sample living trusts on the internet.make sure the form is approved for use in your state  and that it will cover the assets you plan to include in your trust. some forms may not work if you have a large estate that exceeds federal estate tax exclusion limits.    the first sections of your trust include your name  the name of your trust  and the type of trust you are creating.since you are creating the trust for your property  you will list your own name as the grantor. the name of your trust doesn t have to be fancy. just use your own name and identify the type of trust it is. for example  the name of your trust could be  the sally sunshine revocable living trust.     if you re using a form or sample as a guide  you can largely copy this language   but read through it and make sure you understand what it means.while you are alive  you are considered the trustee of your own living trust. after you die  your successor trustee will take over and distribute your property to the people you ve listed as beneficiaries. as trustee  you have the same rights and abilities to use  transfer  or sell your property as you did before you created the trust. after you die  your successor trustee will manage and distribute that property to the beneficiaries you ve named. your successor trustee will be responsible for reporting any income earned from the trust assets and transferring property ownership from the trust to your listed beneficiaries.    the trust s beneficiaries are the people who will inherit the assets you place in the trust after you die.you can list the property separately on your declaration  or you can create a separate schedule of property and refer to that document. for example  you might write  at the death of the grantor  the trustee shall distribute the trust property in accordance with schedule a  attached.     to list the property and assets included in the trust  write a separate document and attach it as a schedule to your declaration of trust.by creating a separate document  you can easily amend it later on without having to execute an entire declaration all over again. you generally have the ability to change the assets in your trust whenever you want. if at any time you decide to take something out  or if you acquire a new asset you want to add  just update your schedule and change the property ownership documents to reflect the trust.    typically you must sign your declaration of trust in the presence of a notary.you typically can find a notary public at your local courthouse  but expect to pay a small fee. many banks provide notary services free of charge to their customers. you may want to sign and have notarized more than one copy of your trust  so you have multiple originals. that way you can have an original copy for your records and you can provide another original copy to your successor trustee.    although you typically aren t required by law to file your trust with a court or government agency  you do need to keep it safe.if you have a home safe  you can keep your trust there. you also may want to use a safe deposit box at a bank or post office. in addition to your personal copy  make sure your successor trustee has his or her own copy  or knows where your copy is located and how to access it. unlike wills  trusts don t have to be filed with the court  and there will be no public record. for this reason  trusts are preferred by people who have privacy concerns.  your trust isn t finalized until you actually put the trust s assets in the name of the trust.typically the property will still be in your name  but you must add language indicating that you are now holding it in trust. if real property is included in your trust  you will have to execute a new deed that includes the trustee language. for example  your new titles or deeds might read  sally sunshine  trustee of the sally sunshine revocable living trust dated july 4  2016.  just use your own name and the date you executed your trust. when you sign any documents related to the property  remember to add  trustee  after your signature.  an ein is necessary to file a tax return for the trust.although the irs doesn t require you to file a separate tax return for your trust while you are still alive  a tax return may be required after your death if you have assets in the trust that earn income. since you can get an ein relatively easy for free  it s easiest to just go ahead and do it ahead of time rather than leaving it for your successor trustee to do. you can apply for an ein online at https   www.irs.gov businesses small businesses   self employed apply for an

magazines and comb the internet for styles that really stand out to you. after you ve scrapbooked for a while  you ll notice that a clear picture of what you really want your dress or tux to look like is beginning to form in your mind.   try to narrow things down as specifically as possible  even down to particular color choices. bring your scrapbook with you when you go shopping. it will help you stay focused on the look you re going for and make shopping a little easier.    give yourself plenty of time to search for the right dress. this is not a choice that you want to rush  start looking about 3 or 4 months in advance. hit all of the stores in your area and if possible  have a parent take you shopping out of town  as well.   remember  all of the other girls are shopping just like you are. they are most likely going to the same shops and looking at the same gowns. shopping out of town will help you feel secure that whatever dress you choose  someone else won t be wearing it. don t forget to hunt for a dress online. it s not an ideal situation  since you won t be able to try it on before you buy it. however  if you find something that you really love online and it s still relatively early in the game  you can have it tailored to fit you perfectly once it arrives.    while tuxedos aren t quite as variable as dresses  there are still a lot of details you ll want to get just right. start hunting for your tux about 3 or 4 months in advance.   prom is a black tie affair  so you really want to go with either a tuxedo or a very dark and dapper suit.try to narrow down which one you want before you go out shopping  so that you can stay focused. at the very least  nail it down super early in your hunt. most choose to go with a tux  but there s no reason why you can t do your own thing  you want to ensure that you are able to find your ideal tux in plenty of time to also have it tailored before prom. tuxedos and suits  right off the rack  are generally cut to fit male model prototypes. gender presentation  personal style or sexual orientation aren t usually addressed right off the rack.  bring someone that you know will be completely honest with you. whenever you find a dress or tux that you are definitely considering  don t just try it on alone in the dressing room. come out and get their honest opinion.   when you try on a gown or tux that you really like  ask your shopping companion to snap a picture of you wearing it with your phone. that way you ll have a mini archive of everything that you really liked to reference later  when you re ready to start narrowing it down. don t make a snap decision. try on lots of dresses or other ensembles and collect at least 10 to 15 pictures of possible choices for your mini archive before even considering making your final decision.    avoid shopping for fads and choose a dress style and fit that suits your particular figure and coloring.not only will you look better  but you will ultimately feel more confident wearing a dress that you know suits you as an individual.   fads are great  but some gowns and styles are timeless and will always be beautiful. when you look back at your prom pictures years later  you want to feel proud of the way you look  not slightly embarrassed because you re wearing a fad that passed quickly and didn t look good on you.    if you find the absolute perfect dress but it s too small when you try it on  do not buy the dress with the intention of going on an intense crash diet. that is far too much pressure to put on yourself  and worse   if you fail  what will you wear instead  you ll have to rush to find a back up at the last minute  which you definitely want to avoid.   you look great the way you are right now and there are plenty of beautiful

when you try it on  talk to a store associate about the possibility of tailoring it. some gowns are made of materials that aren t suitable for tailoring  and others are just too fragile or stylized to be changed  so get a good  clear opinion from an expert.    when it comes to choosing jewelry and shoes  base your selections around your dress. not just the color of the dress   you want to go beyond that. look for options that suit the style of your dress. a particular necklace may look gorgeous in the case  but clash with your dress.   for instance  if you decide on a vintage looking gown  you don t want to wear modern jewelry with it. you ll want to pick things that have a vintage flair  to coordinate with the dress style. focus on achieving an overall look  rather than finding individual pieces that you like that may or may not end up looking good together.    traditionally  prom couples coordinate their ensembles by choosing matching and complimentary accessories to tie their look together as a unit. find out the color of your date s dress in plenty of time to find your accessories.   choose a long tie  bow tie  and or cummerbund that match your date s dress as closely as possible. you can also have your date provide her dress to a tailor  who can then dye your accessories to match hers almost exactly. if you aren t able to match your date s dress  go with neutral choices that match your tux or suit. long tie or bow tie  the bow tie is the traditional choice  especially with a tuxedo.if you go with a suit  opt for a long tie instead.    don t accessorize with something that doesn t immediately make you feel pretty or handsome when you put it on. accessories are meant to accent and highlight your ensemble and you. select them with care and be very choosy.

a particular person.   if you are going with a group  consider coordinating your looks as a unit.    yes  your shoes should be totally awesome  but they also need to be relatively comfortable to wear. prom isn t just standing around   you ll be dancing  getting in and out of cars  and navigating obstacles. if you choose your shoes based on looks alone  you may end up being miserable on prom night because you can t dance in them  or because they are squeezing your feet too tightly.   try them on before you buy them and walk around the store until you get a sense of how they ll perform on prom night. be honest with yourself  if you love them but it s obvious that the heels are too high for you  keep looking. you ll find the right pair eventually. on prom night  when you re cutting a rug on the dancefloor and having a blast  you ll be glad you took the extra time to find the right shoes.    don t be afraid to try something that you normally wouldn t wear. it s prom  so live the fantasy a little  for instance  maybe you find a breathtaking tiara that perfectly mirrors your dress and hairstyle. or maybe it s an unusual set of cufflinks to go with your tux or suit. ordinarily you d never wear a tiara or those particular cufflinks  but it s prom night  if it looks good on you  then rock it.   make sure to get a few opinions before you commit to anything unusual. you want to stand out  but not for the wrong reasons.    start scrapbooking a few months in advance  just like you did for your dress. in fact  you can start matching makeup looks to dress styles as early as the scrapbooking stage    by the time you get to the hair and makeup part of your prom deliberations  you ll already have your dress and accessories picked out  as well as a book full of images to review. you can t go wrong when you prepare that well     start experimenting with the looks you find very early to get a clear picture of what does and doesn t work for you. don t be afraid to try a daring hair or makeup style  it might be absolutely perfect for your dress and suit you wonderfully. on the other hand  it may make you feel uncomfortable or anxious on prom night  and that s no fun.

pictures and be recognizable to your date and friends  essentially  you want to look like the best version of your everyday self  with a little extra pizzazz thrown in.    after you ve experimented with a few looks and you nail it down  practice recreating your hair and makeup look multiple times before the big night. you don t want to spend 3 hours on the afternoon of prom trying to perfect winged eyeliner or some other detail that you aren t used to creating   that will definitely stress you out.   if you practice ahead of time you can perfect the look and when prom comes  you can recreate it without a hitch. after applying your makeup  always set it with a translucent powder as your final step. this will help your makeup last through the night and also control any oil and shine  which will keep you looking fresh and matte for photographs.    that could be anything from a dashing side part  slicked back completely  or even a messy  tousled  do  depending on what kind of look you are going for.   get short hair cut or trimmed a day or two before prom  not the day of. if you want a straight razor shave  visit a barbershop on the morning of prom. if you want to look really unique or do something very different from everyone else  consider dying your hair. you could even consider dying streaks into your hair that coordinate with your date s ensemble  don t be afraid to stand out or embrace a look that truly represents you.    if you aren t that savvy with makeup or hairstyles  consult your hairstylist. most stylists studied makeup along with hair when they were training at cosmetology school  so they are invaluable sources of information and can help you create the perfect look.   express to your stylist that you want your hair to look great  but you also want a fairly uncomplicated  do that you can maintain easily on your own throughout the evening. don t get talked into something that you don t like by an over zealous stylist.    you want to

vitamins and nutrients to keep you healthy and glowing. drinking lots of water will keep you looking dewy and fresh and help you keep your complexion clear.   don t starve yourself before prom. you

your skin doesn t react well to them. make sure to exfoliate with a gentle product every few days. don t overdo it  you don t need to exfoliate every day   that is too harsh on your skin. do any eyebrow plucking and waxing several days before prom  not the night before or the day of. otherwise  you might end up having some unsightly skin irritation to cover up.  getting ready for prom can be stressful. there are so many decisions to be made and you want everything to be perfect  which is understandable. but don t take it too far  it s too much pressure to put on yourself. yes  you want to look great  but you also want to have fun at prom.   if you stress yourself out to the max  you ll do nothing on prom night except worry over little details that no one even notices except you. prom

lipstick or fret in general. get out there and have fun     in the weeks leading up to prom  make sure you get a full night of sleep every night.  beauty sleep  isn t just a myth  during sleep  our

little complicated  but don t worry  once you start trying to practice the sounds  you ll be able to feel the difference between voicing and not voicing.voiced consonants are pronounced by vibrating your vocal cords.for example  voiced consonants in english include z in  zoo  and g in  good .  unvoiced consonants are pronounced without vibrating your vocal cords. for example  unvoiced consonants in english include s in  snap  and k in  kitten .    hindi consonants also fall into two basic subcategories  unaspirated and aspirated. you can have unvoiced unaspirated consonants  unvoiced aspirated consonants  etc.aspiration is another term for a burst of air released through your mouth. the only way to really understand how this works in hindi is to listen to recordings.    the hindi alphabet may look a little alien to you  especially if you are a native english speaker  but with some practice  you ll be able to understand how to make all the hindi letter sounds yourself.a video recording of the hindi alphabet is here  https   www.youtube.com watch v xyg 594woje.   once you have listened to the recording a few times  pause the recording and try to mimic the pronunciation of the speaker. take your time and work your way slowly through alphabet.    you may find it easier to learn the devanagari script if you can see how it is written. there are several tutorials available online  but the one at hindibhasha.com is widely recommended by university language departments.    nouns are words for objects  places  emotions  animals  and people. in hindi  all nouns have a gender  masculine  m  or feminine  f . the gender of hindi nouns is essential for proper grammar and communication  so when learning hindi nouns  you must also learn their genders so you can use the nouns correctly.a very general rule to determine the gender for a noun is words that end with the vowel   aa are usually masculine and words that end with the vowel   ee are usually feminine. however  there are many exceptions to this rule  so it s important to still learn the gender of every noun through memorization and practice.for example  the noun for boy is        larkaa  m  and the noun for girl is        larkee  f . so in the case of these nouns  the general rule of gender applies. on the other hand  nouns like      kelaa   banana  m  and      mez   desk  f  or    ghar   house  m  are all exceptions to the general rule of gender.    simple pronouns like  he  she  i  we  they  are key to communicating in any language  including hindi. the pronouns in hindi are first person singular      main   i first person plural     ham   we second person singular     too   you  intimate  second person plural      tum   you  informal      aap   you  formal   a note on informal and formal pronouns  each pronoun is used based on the level of politeness in a conversation. use the formal    aap when meeting someone for the first time  talking to someone older than you or simply to show respect to the person you are addressing. use the informal     tum when chatting with your friends or close relatives. use    too when you are in a very informal or intimate conversation  such as talking to your partner or to young children. it would be considered extremely rude in hindi to use    too when talking to a stranger or someone you barely know.   third person singular     yah   he   she  it   this third person plural     vah   he   she  it   that  in spoken hindi these words are pronounced slightly differently     is pronounced yeh and    is pronounced voh. use    yeh when talking about someone or something close to you  so if someone is standing right next to you  use    yeh. use    voh when talking about someone or something further away  so if someone is standing on the other side of the street  use    voh. when in doubt  use    voh.   third person plural     ye   these   they third person plural     ve  those   they  you will often hear    ve being pronounced as the singular  voh . the third person plural pronouns follow the same rules     ye for people   things close to you  in the distance sense  and    vo for people   things further away. note that both    yeh or    voh could mean either  he  or  she   so there is no difference based on the gender of how you are talking to. you must rely on the context of the sentence to determine if a person is talking to a  he  or  she .      verbs describe an action  occurrence  or state of being. learn hindi verbs in the infinitive form  in english   to        as verbs are conjugated by dropping the infinitive ending and adding other suffixes. hindi infinitives end in    naa.examples of hindi infinitives include       honaa   to be        pahrnaa   to read or to study        bolnaa   to speak        seekhnaa   to learn       jaanaa   to go.  like nouns  verbs in hindi must be conjugated to reflect grammatical categories such as number  gender  tense  and mood.for example  the infinitive verb      honaa  to be  conjugated for number becomes           main hoon   i am        ham hain   we are       too hai   you are  intimate         tum ho    you are  informal         aap hain   you are  formal        yah hai   he she this is       voh hai   he she that is        ye hain   these they are        ve hain   those they are   there are three conjugations for gender in the present verb tense   for masculine singular subjects  drop the infinitive ending    naa and add    taa. for masculine plural subjects  drop the infinitive ending    naa and add    te. for feminine singular or feminine plural subjects  drop the infinitive ending    naa and add    tee.   because hindi verbs have many tenses  you ll want to use a textbook or other reference materials to learn verb conjugations beyond the basic present tense. a good reference dictionary will also help you conjugate new verbs.    once you become more comfortable with hindi nouns  pronouns  and verbs  you can move on to studying other elements of hindi.  oxford university press publishes the gold standard of dictionaries  the oxford hindi english dictionary.while smaller pocket dictionaries are fine if you just need to look up a

query	40	win emmy law & order: special victims unit deal with a jury duty scam  sometimes  phone scammers can utilize call spoofing technology to make you think that you re getting a call from your local police department or the local courthouse. and sometimes  scammers can dupe their victims into thinking the call is real by either already having your personal information or by using the name of real court law enforcement officials to have their victims believing the call is real.   court officials and or law enforcement officials will never contact you asking for confidential information or money. furthermore  they ll never give a head s up phone call warning of an impending arrest  about missing jury duty or any other infraction.  authentic jury duty notifications  as well as  no show  summonses  are  always delivered by mail to your legal address. in rare instances  you may be telephoned by legitimate courthouse employees  but that s if the courthouse sent you a jury duty summons  but the postal service had it returned to sender because it couldn t be delivered   and you won t be asked for personal information such as your social security number  birth date or driver s license number when they call you.  most of the time  scammers traditionally call when most businesses  such as courthouses are closed for the day because they know they have a better chance of reaching their intended victims.  if you fail to show  the court will contact you via the postal service. from there  if you still don t respond to the letters  an official from your local sheriff s office will show up at your door to remind you of your civic duty as a juror. and finally  you can be held in contempt of court  which can result in a fine of several hundred dollars. sometimes  the judge can issue a  bench warrant   which means an officer can arrest you if you are pulled over for a traffic stop. but they ll never show up to get you arrested for missing jury duty and they ll never demand you pay a fine on the spot.

query	44	happen chernobyl disaster help children cope with a disaster  how a child copes with disaster or emergencies is often tied to the way parents cope because children can detect adults  fears and sadness. parents are almost always the best source of support for children in disasters. one way to establish a sense of control and to build confidence in children before a disaster is to engage and involve them in preparing a family disaster plan. after a disaster  children can contribute to a family recovery plan.    parents can build their own unique social support systems so that in an emergency situation or when a disaster strikes  they can be supported and helped to manage their reactions.   nan  in the absence of severe threat to life  injury  loss of loved ones  or secondary problems such as loss of home  moves  etc.  symptoms usually diminish over time.    clarify misunderstandings about risk and danger by listening to children s concerns and answering questions. maintain a sense of calm by validating children s concerns and perceptions and with discussion of concrete plans for safety.    if a young child is asking questions about the event  answer them simply without the elaboration needed for an older child or adult. some children are comforted by knowing more or less information than others  decide what level of information your particular child needs. if a child has difficulty expressing feelings  allow the child to draw a picture or tell a story of what happened.    following a disaster  children are most afraid that the event will happen again  someone close to them will be killed or injured  and that they will be left alone or separated from the family.      personal contact is reassuring. hug and touch your children. spend extra time with your children such as at bedtime. calmly provide factual information about the recent disaster and current plans for insuring their safety along with recovery plans. encourage your children to talk about their feelings. re establish your daily routine for work  school  play  meals  and rest. involve your children by giving them specific chores to help them feel they are helping to restore family and community life. praise and recognize responsible behavior. understand that your children will have a range of reactions to disasters. encourage your children to help update your family disaster plan.    you can get professional help from the child s primary care physician  a mental health provider specializing in children s needs  or a member of the clergy.    news coverage related to a disaster may elicit fear and confusion and arouse anxiety in children. this is particularly true for large scale disasters or a terrorist event where significant property damage and loss of life has occurred. particularly for younger children  repeated images of an event may cause them to believe the event is recurring over and over.   if parents allow children to watch television or use the internet where images or news about the disaster are shown  parents should be with them to encourage communication and provide explanations. this may also include parent s monitoring and appropriately limiting their own exposure to anxiety provoking information.  
query	45	become a f1 driver formula one become an f1 driver  this is the quickest way to find out if formula 1 is right for you. it is ideal for older racers that are new to the sport. you will get to get behind the wheel of a formula 1 race car and learn some of the basics of racing.these classes may have a substantial fee for a few hours of racing knowledge  but it is the most affordable way to gain knowledge about formula 1 racing before you decide to make a larger financial commitment.   you must have a valid standard driver s license to take these classes  and if you are a minor you will also need parental consent. you must be capable of driving a car with a manual transmission to take racing classes.    these programs will involve approximately 1 2 weeks of advanced classes to hone your racing skills. since your goal is to race in formula one  you likely want to select a school that is approved by the licensing organization.    upon completion of the required courses your school will send a letter of recommendation to a racing organization. this will enable you to register and compete in a racing school event.    these entry level race events are a great opportunity for amateur drivers to showcase their skills and get the attention of potential sponsors. some schools hold their own races and will even provide you a car for these race events. you can win scholarships and race points towards getting your next level license.    this method is the best way for younger racers to get involved in the sport. most of the top formula 1 drivers all started off racing carts. buying a kart can be costly  so you may just want to visit a local kart track and try it out first.    some organizations will give any beginner that applies a license so they can start entry level races to learn the sport. to get into more serious races  you will need to continue to apply for higher licenses. you may need to pass a test given at an accredited school  or show proficiency at racing at your current level before being allowed to move up.    if you are going to race you need some wheels. there are different vehicles for different levels of race  and you will probably need to buy or rent several karts before you move up to racing cars.  placing well in races is a big part in how quickly your racing career advances. the better you perform the sooner you will reach the next level. if you plan on getting to formula 1  you will need to race as much as you can and always be looking to move up to the next level.    formula 1 requires drivers to have a good deal of experience driving similar vehicles. while there are many possible race series that can be your path to formula 1  all racers must go through one or more of the junior levels to move up.  formula 1 racers must all be a minimum age to hold a license. some younger racers are good enough to be considered for formula 1  but will not be eligible until they reach the proper age. if you are still too young  look at gaining some more experience in any of the junior single seater race series to add to your race points.    these points are acquired based on performance and placement in junior race series events. 40 points must be acquired over a 3 year period to be eligible to get your formula 1 license.    to be eligible to hold the racing license you need to have a good handle on driving the car. these hours can be logged doing practice laps or test drives for car manufacturers.    if you have performed well as an amateur an owner might ask for you to drive for their team. these teams are often owned by car companies and have their own sponsorships to cover costs. they usually sign their drivers on a season to season basis.    most formula 1 drivers have some sponsors that require additional work off the track. to attract sponsors you need to have success on the track and a positive public opinion. you may have to do appearances or photo shoots for your sponsor in addition to your on track work. racing is a very expensive sport  so drivers must look to add to supplement their racing income whenever possible.    pay drivers are common in many levels of motorsports  including formula 1. instead of being paid by the race team  the driver uses money from sponsorships or their personal fortune to fund the racing operations.while this isn t practical for most new racers in formula 1  it is an option if you have the ability to pay for it.

query	48	apply for citizenship immigration obtain dual citizenship  were you born in a state whose right to citizenship you have never exercised  if so  then you might be eligible for citizenship through an unrestricted right of soil  also known as unconditional jus soli. this means that you have an automatic birthright to be a citizen of that country because you were born there. for example  if you are currently a british citizen who was born in the united states  you are entitled to american citizenship through unrestricted jus soli.research the immigration laws of your country of birth. most countries do not grant citizenship through right of soil  so it is important to research the laws of the country in which you were born.30 of the world s 194 countries practice unconditional jus soli.of these 30 countries  canada and the united states  as of 2010  are the only countries among the world s advanced economies that practice unconditional jus soli and grant citizenship to most children born on its soil  including children born to persons present in the state illegally.however  children born in the united states to foreign diplomats and foreign heads of state do not acquire citizenship through right of soil.    you may find that your country of birth  which is not the country whose citizenship rights you exercise  grants you a right to its citizenship through a right of soil. if so  discover how you can exercise that right.   one way to exercise a right to citizenship is to apply for a passport. you can apply for a passport through the state s embassy or consulate in your current country of citizenship and or residence. you may be asked to present an original or certified copy of your birth certificate to the consulate or embassy as evidence. for example  if you apply for a canadian passport  then you can present a birth certificate issued by the canadian province or territory in which you were born. this serves as evidence of your canadian citizenship because canada practices unrestricted jus soli.  find out the laws regarding dual citizenship of both the state of your current citizenship and of the state whose second citizenship you are trying to obtain. consider whether enforcing your right of soil citizenship may require renouncing your current citizenship. this is important because not all states that practice unconditional jus soli permit their citizens to hold dual citizenship.   for example  pakistan practices unconditional jus soli  with a few minor exceptions  but only permits dual citizenship with a select number of states.examples of countries that both practice unconditional jus soli and permit dual citizenship are the united states and canada.  most countries in the world grant citizenship on the basis of right of blood or jus sanguinis. under the jus sanguinis principle  you acquire one or both of your parents  citizenship upon birth.this means that the child acquires the parents  citizenship regardless of where she is born  and her only citizenship is the one acquired through right of blood if she is born in a country that does not practice jus soli.   for example  if you were born in the united states  but your parents are both british citizens  then you are also a british citizen.    find out if obtaining a second citizenship through the jus sanguinis principle of a state would require you to renounce your prior citizenship. if that is the case  you cannot become a dual citizen.   both the united states and the united kingdom permit dual citizenship. however  there are other countries that grant citizenship on the jus sanguinis principle and do not permit dual citizenship.singapore  for example  practices jus sanguinis but does not allow dual citizenship.  the process that you will need to follow to gain citizenship through parentage will vary by country. check with the country s consulate to determine what you will need to do.   for example  if you are currently an american citizen who was born to british parents  and you are under the age of 18  it is your parents who must apply on your behalf to register you as a british citizen. the application form and guidance on how to register as a british citizen in this scenario are available here.    many countries issue resident visas or permits to individuals who are willing to invest in the country s economy  and those resident visas can make you eligible for citizenship after a few years. this can be an expensive route as the minimum investment amounts range from several hundred thousand dollars to several million dollars.for example  the united states requires an investment of  1 million  or  500 000 if you are investing in a high unemployment or rural area   and in return you receive a conditional permanent resident permit.  this path to citizenship can take a long time  so research the amount of time that it will take you to become a citizen before you decide to invest.   for example  the united states and belgium grant citizenship after five years of holding a resident permit of this type. however  malta  whose minimum investment requirement is eur 1 million  grants citizenship after only 1 year.    some states that grant investor visas also require that you remain a resident in that state before you can become a citizen. however  not all countries have residency requirements.   for example  cyprus does not have a residency requirement but the united states does.  not all countries permit dual citizenship. you may be required to renounce your prior citizenship in order to acquire citizenship by investment. if that is the case  you cannot become a dual citizen in this way.    if you are married to someone who holds a citizenship that you do not  then you might consider whether your spouse s country of citizenship grants you citizenship by marriage. this process involves applying for a resident permit that you would qualify for based on your marriage. you would also need to meet any residency requirements.   if you believe that you can acquire a second citizenship through marriage  research the laws of your spouse s country of citizenship regarding citizenship by this route. the laws about the application process and amount of time involved to obtain citizenship will vary by country. for example  if you are married to a british citizen  you must meet certain requirements before you can apply to become a british citizen by marriage. you must be 18 years of age or older  of sound mind  of good character  e.g. you don t have a serious criminal record   you must meet english language requirements and show knowledge of life in the uk  you must have been granted indefinite permission to stay in the uk  and you must meet a residency requirement.  note that entering into a sham or fake marriage for the sole purpose of acquiring residency and  subsequent citizenship  of your spouse s country is considered fraud and is a serious criminal offense in most countries. do not attempt to enter into a sham marriage for the purpose of becoming a dual citizen  as the legal consequences of this can be severe.  not all countries permit dual citizenship  and your spouse s country of citizenship may be one that requires you to renounce your previous citizenship. if that is the case  then you cannot become a dual citizen through marriage.    you may also gain citizenship by applying for a job in another country. some countries allow individuals who have legally entered the country on a work visa to convert their visa status to permanent residency and then to citizenship.   for example  in australia you can apply for a number of categories of employment visas that have their own requirements. one type is called a skilled independent visa and it allows you to enter australia with the intention of working in australia as long as you meet the criteria. if you spend four consecutive years in australia under the visa  then you become eligible for australian citizenship.  in many countries  the first step to becoming a citizen is to apply for residency. once you become a resident  you may then apply for citizenship through naturalization. eligibility requirements vary from country to country.   for example  in the united states you can qualify for permanent residency through the diversity immigrant visa program. this program randomly draws from a pool of individuals who are from countries with low rates of immigration to the united states.check to see if the country in which you are interested in acquiring a second citizenship has a similar route to acquiring residency. once you acquire residency and meet any other criteria  then you can apply for citizenship.    keep in mind that not all countries permit dual citizenship. if you acquire citizenship of a state through a work visa  visa lottery  or other program  then you may be required to renounce your prior citizenship. if that is the case  you cannot become a dual citizen by following this route.  
query	49	issue indictment islamic terrorism help stop terrorism  while large scale  transnational terrorism has more wide reaching effects  domestic terrorism is a more frequent occurrence in the u.s. and many other nations. look for suspicious activity in your community to help thwart local terrorism attempts. alert local authorities if you witness individuals amassing a large quantity of weapons  chemicals  or other potentially harmful items individuals who are not authorized security officials conducting surveillance  e.g. with binoculars  video cameras  individuals trying to gain information about secure facilities  in person  by telephone  or via email  individuals attempting to breach secured entrances    to truly be vigilant and observant of suspicious behaviour  avoid narrowing your scope to a specific demographic or profile of terrorism. violent extremism is not unique to any one social group or religious belief system  and should not be regarded as such. make a point of being aware of suspicious activity regardless of the race  age  appearance  or social standing of the person s  involved.  individuals who commit terrorist acts generally go through a period of radicalization that leads to their violent behaviour. be on the lookout for alarming behavioural changes in colleagues  acquaintances  friends  or family that might indicate radicalization. these changes might include suddenly dropping relationships with family and long time friends unexplained dropping of commitments  e.g. school  work  a drastic change in dress  eating  sleeping  money management  or spoken language becoming antisocial and withdrawing from everyday life expressing radical or extremist views  or participating in social media networks that promote these views    be sure to contact your local police department immediately if you witness suspicious events or behaviour in your area. be sure to provide a clear  accurate account of what you saw  exactly when you saw it  where you saw it  and why you are concerned. include concrete details about the person or persons involved  as well as any vehicles or other objects involved.for instance  report a suspicious event by calling local authorities and saying   i am calling to report something suspicious that i just witnessed on the corner of 45th avenue and center street. a man was pulling on a chain lock on the gate of a secured building and appeared to be trying to gain access. he was about 5 11  was wearing black pants and a black jacket  and appeared to be between 30 40 years old. he seemed agitated and nervous so i thought it best to report what i saw.     if you have strong suspicions that terrorist activity is taking place  submit a tip online to the federal authorities. online reports will be viewed by an agent or another professional staff member of the organization and handled accordingly. to report an immediate threat  find the number for your local federal security office and contact it as soon as possible.   in the u.s.  visit the fbi website at https   tips.fbi.gov  to fill out a form for tips and public leads  which will require your name  location  contact information  and a detailed description of the suspicious activity that you witnessed.  if you suspect that a breach to cyber security has occurred  e.g. an attempt to gain unauthorized access to a secured system or its data  report it to local authorities. finance and power systems are especially vulnerable to cyber terrorism  but security fixes and upgrades are increasingly being mounted to lower the risk of such attacks. reporting potential threats may aid with these measures.if you are a u.s. resident you may also report your suspicions to the united states computer emergency readiness team  a division of the u.s. department of homeland security. visit the organization s website at https   www.us cert.gov forms report to submit a report.    extreme poverty can cause a low standard of life  a sense of disenfranchisement  and a lack of opportunities. this lack of choices and hope sometimes creates a feeling of desperation that leaves young people vulnerable to recruitment by terrorist groups. support charities that fight poverty on a global level  such as unicef k.i.d.s.  kids in distressed situations  interaction action against hunger    discrimination can cause unrest  distrust  and anger  all of which may create an environment where terrorism becomes more likely. do your best to fight discrimination within your community on a day to day basis by being aware of it  denouncing it  and declining to associate with individuals who perpetuate hate against specific demographics of people. be considerate in your dialogue and treatment of others.for instance  if you observe discrimination of a client or customer by an employee of a business or other organization  report the incident to their superiors as soon as possible to ensure that they will be held accountable for their behaviour.    while terrorism might seem like a huge  overwhelming phenomenon  efforts to make small scale social improvements can help in the larger fight against it. radicalization cannot be traced to one common cause  but it is attributed to both  push factors   e.g. marginalization  inequality  discrimination  and  pull factors   e.g. the appeal of extremist groups  who offer a feeling of inclusion and an outlet for grievances . reach out to marginalized colleagues  peers  and acquaintances who may be feeling isolated to help foster a stronger  more inclusive sense of community.for instance  invite marginalized colleagues out for group lunches or other activities. reach out to uneasy or isolated new neighbours by making a kind gesture  bringing over a gift or offering to help with an outdoor task  e.g. shovelling the driveway .    the goal of terrorism is to spread fear  so help overcome its paralyzing effects by keeping terror statistics in perspective. the odds of a u.s. citizen being killed in a terror attack are approximately one in twenty million  taking into account both home and overseas incidents. keep this information in mind and share it when family  friends  or colleagues express anxiety about the threat of terrorist attacks.  to really make an impact in the war against terrorism  pursue a counterterrorism career. government agencies provide a wide variety of job opportunities in the field  while public and private organizations offer numerous positions in counterintelligence. the jobs may include criminal investigators intelligence analysts

by the soviets.    the western front was the site of many conflicts between germany and other western european countries like denmark  norway  luxembourg  belgium  france  the united kingdom  and the netherlands.the first phase of the war in the western front involved many of these western countries fighting germany in attempts that culminated with the battle of britain. the second phase saw a lot of ground combat between the two sides that began with the landing in normandy and lasted until the german defeat in 1945. the major battles fought on the western front include the normandy d day landing  the battle of the bulge  the battle of britain  and the battle of arnhem.  after the japanese attack on american s military bases at pearl harbor  the us launched a counterstrike against the

query	53	pevent flood help flood victims  chances are you already have a specific flood trajectory in mind  but if you don t or aren t abreast with smaller scaled floods happening throughout the world  the first step is to find out which regions have suffered floods and need help.   depending on where the flood occurred  different humanitarian organizations will be involved in coordinating relief efforts. if the flood occurred in the united states  chances are the american red cross and salvation army will be marshalling aid and leading relief efforts. if it is an international natural disaster  check to see if unicef or americares are providing aid in the affected area. visit the organization s website or call to find out what kind of aid they are providing and how you can best get involved.    as the needs change  so will the ways you can help    some ways might be more inline with your abilities or resources over others.   different needs will arise at different moments in the crisis. for instance  there will be emergent needs in the immediate aftermath as well as long term rebuilding needs for years to come. sometimes an organization will reach maximum capacity with certain types of donations  like clothing   but have a deficit in another area. the best way to know what is most needed is to frequently check in with the status of their aid efforts and need by calling or looking for updates on their social media accounts.    there are several ways to get involved  and each has their own pros and cons as detailed below in and in the following sections.   if you have extra funds or goods  you might consider making monetary donations. if you have time  skills  or other supportive resources to offer in lieu of monetary donations  you can offer these to those in need. there are pros cons for each this type of involvement  for donations  a pro is that you can act quickly and put resources in the hands of organizations who can decide how to best help the victims. a con to making donations is that you don t necessarily know if all of your money will go directly to the victims  be sure to research how organizations administer donations before you give to them . one of the biggest pros of volunteering instead of donating money is that you get to feel like you really providing hands on helps while interacting with people. a potential con is the danger and risk of injury associated with traveling to flood zones.    sending money is an easy and effective way to help.   be sure that you are donating to a reputable organization like the salvation army  american red cross  or unicef. unfortunately  some sham organizations can crop up in the aftermath of disasters as ploys to steal well intentioned donations.ask if you can make a donation via text message. a recent trend among aid organizations is to provide a phone number and keyword for people to make a donations. the amount you give will show up on your next mobile phone bill. it s as easy as sending a text message  and much more meaningful   if you have extra or unneeded items laying around  consider donating them to flood victims in need.gently used clothing  socks  shoes  bedding  and blankets are almost always in need after a devastating flood. you can also help the children affected by floods by sending them books and toys. purchase and donate new  non perishable food items and bottled drinking water. first aid kits  tents  mosquito netting  soap  and hygiene products might also be needed.    floods can cause serious injuries and there may be a need for more blood after a the disaster. if there s a blood drive in your area  and if you meet the health age requirements  consider becoming a donor.  some large companies  especially governmental agencies or offices  allow people to donate their unused sick time or vacation leave to others in need. contact the human resources representative at your work and ask if you can transfer some of your leave time to those unable to work as a result of the flood.  if it s safe enough to travel to the afflicted area  see if aid organizations are looking for volunteers to help on the ground.   if you meet height  weight  age  fitness  education  and u.s. citizenship requirements  consider joining the national guard. the national guard is a part time  locally organized branch of the u.s. military that responds to natural disasters  both in the u.s. and sometimes abroad  as part of their call of duty.after completing basic training  you can chose a short term enlistment  three years  and then continue to be a member of the individual ready reserve  irr  who are called up in the event of emergencies like natural disasters.consider volunteering with habitat for humanities or other organizations whose mission is to clear debris  help homeowners salvage their personal belongings  and rebuild damaged homes.   your time and talents are a valuable resource and can help those in need.if you are a health care professional  see if you can donate your medical services or supplies. if you are a contractor or work in construction  volunteer your manpower  supplies  and other resources towards rebuilding efforts. if you are an educator or child care worker  offer to provide support and assistance with displaced families and their children. if you are a business owner  especially in the area surrounding the flood  offer discounts or gratis goods services to those affected by the flood.    even if you can t be there on the ground  you can still make a big difference by volunteering.   get in touch with the local branch of the aid organization working with flood victims and see if they need help in their call center  hotline  or donation processing facility. you can also become a community liaison by collecting local donations and bringing them to the regional sorting facility.    if you live nearby the flood area and your house is intact  consider fostering a displaced family who may have lost their home and everything they own in the disaster.  many people rely on their faith during times of crisis and draw emotional and spiritual strength from the support of church and religion.   if you are part of a church or religious organization  encourage your leaders to reach out to flood victims with support as well as tangible aid. some large religious organization  like the billy graham rapid response team  send crisis trained chaplains into areas impacted by natural disasters to coordinate relief efforts and provide further emotional and spiritual support for those affected.if you are a spiritual person  pray for the flood victims and or reflect for a moment on the situation. open your heart to ways you can help  and be a comfort to those in need.  in additional to other forms of help  you can make some basic  caring gestures towards those in need.ask how you can be most helpful to those affected by the flood. they might need a hot  home cooked meal  help taking care of their pets  or photographing flood damage for insurance claims. be a good listener and remember that sometimes its best to just listen and not offer your own opinions or solutions without being asked for them. remember that people need support in the days  months  and even years following natural disasters. be sensitive to the fact that new issues and difficulties can continue to arise  even after the flood waters subside.  
query	54	create an anti gravity propulsion system anti-gravity learn and understand the physiology behind the inhibition of the acetyl choline esterase enzyme  this enzyme is a convenient target of chemical warfare agents due to its important role in removing the immediate effect of the acetylcholine molecule at the neuromuscular junction between neurons and muscle cells.   nan  therefore  the neurotransmitter acetylcholine molecules accumulate at the neuromuscular junction between neurons and the muscle cells which continue to function un endlessly by inducing the process of muscles contraction in the autonomic and involuntary muscles of the body.    the most dangerous effect of this muscles contraction is manifested in the muscles of the lungs and the muscle of the diaphragm. the continuous never ending contraction of these muscles can hinder the normal process of breathing. this leads in turn to suffocation of the individual and subsequently to his unavoidable death.    this ammonium group bears a positive charge that imparts hydrophilic properties to this compound. the immediate consequence of this typical chemical structure of this compound is its unique physiological effect of signaling the contraction of the muscle cells.    its main signaling function is by binding to receptors on the outer cellular membrane of muscle cells.    the secretion of this neurotransmitter is reported to occur based on the accumulation of calcium ions in the inner side of the neurons. it is postulated that calcium ions have a role in inducing the secretion of this neurotransmitter into the neuromuscular junction.    this opening of ion channels can induce an action potential in these muscle cells which can lead eventually through a sequence of events to the contraction of muscles primarily of involuntary type of muscles such as muscles of the gastrointestinal tract and the muscles of the lungs and the diaphragm.    contraction of the muscles of the intestine by the effect of this neurotransmitter leads to the so called peristaltic motion of the muscles of the intestinal wall. this in turn causes the propulsion and movement of food content in the stomach along the gastrointestinal tract. this neurotransmitter has many other functions that are related to its effects on muscle contraction in the body.    also secreted by this branch of the nervous system are the neurotransmitters epinephrine and norepinephrine. these two neurotransmitters have completely different roles in the autonomic nervous system that are unrelated to the function of the acetylcholine neurotransmitter.    in both cases the principle of action is very similar. it involves the inhibition of the particular enzyme by specific molecules that have potential of binding either reversibly or irreversibly to one amino acid that is located in the active site of the particular enzyme that is the target of inhibition by the drug.

query	57	teach english grammar teach grammar  in order to teach effectively  you need to know who your students are. you should also know what they want or need to learn from you. this will affect your teaching approach  as well as what you actually teach.   for example  if you are teaching elementary school kids  you might focus on basic grammar rules that are easy to grasp. if you are teaching adults who are learning english as a second language  you might find these students to be older and highly motivated. they also may need immediate language skills.    people learn in different ways depending on how they process information most effectively. think about different styles of learning as you begin to plan how to teach grammar. some of these learning styles include visual learning  these learners prefer reading and want to see what they re learning. auditory learning  these learners prefer to listen to instruction. conversations and interactions are effective ways of teaching this learning style. tactile learning  these learners prefer to touch and manipulate objects in order to learn about something. kinesthetic learning  these learners move around a lot and benefit from getting up from a desk frequently.    take some time to go through a grammar guide or textbook. even if you think you know grammar really well  spend some time refreshing your memory about different rules.    you might choose to use a textbook as a guide for teaching. choose one that is geared toward the same type of students that you will be teaching.    the deductive approach of teaching grammar focuses on teaching certain grammar rules and then giving examples of that rule.it can be useful if you want to quickly explain grammar. it may be more useful with adult students.   this approach can minimize student interaction and involvement. clearly state what the rule allows and limits. give a clear and brief explanation about what the grammar rule allows. also describe what the rule does not allow. for example  always use  you were  and never use  you was.  then follow up with an example of the rule. illustrate the grammar rule with an example. you can use a simple sentence to illustrate it once. then you might choose a more complicated sentence to demonstrate how the rule applies. describe the rules with simplicity. boil down the grammatical rules to simple terms. try not to point out too many exceptions to the rule when you first introduce the rule.    the inductive approach allows students to discover how language and grammar works. students learn grammar by making connections with their pre existing understanding of language. for example  students learning english as a second language will learn to link english grammar rules to their native language grammar rules.   this approach may allow for better memory retention of grammar. in addition  students are more autonomous learners. don t choose the inductive approach if you don t have lots of time. students need to work out a rule on their own by going through examples. figuring out the rule may be at the expense of using the rule in practice. give sentence examples that demonstrate differences. in order to help students pick out the rules  start with two sentences that have slightly different meanings.for example  write   i have read every stephen king book   and  i read stephen king s latest book last week.  ask the student to identify the difference between these two sentences.    the functional approach focuses on teaching grammar so that the students can function in their everyday lives. for example  what will they need to know so that they can go grocery shopping  how will they greet someone beginning students can learn complex concepts and use them in conversation. in this approach  it can be difficult to determine what aspects to focus on first.    use examples of literature and popular writing to illustrate how grammar is used. this can be an effective way to teach grammar.students can choose their own texts or stories that they d like to use. this will make the lesson more interesting for the students. students will also benefit from increased vocabulary. the texts can be difficult if they are too advanced for the student s language level.    a singular noun is a word that describes one thing. plural means that there are more than one thing. in most instances  add an  s  to the end of the singular noun to make it plural.when teaching basic rules  mention that there are exceptions. but you don t need to go into them at this point.    pronouns are words that replace someone s name. for example  mary will become  she  and harry will become  he.  these two together will become  they.  continue with the other pronouns  such as  i    you    we    us   and so on.    conjugating verbs is an essential skill to understanding how to make sentences match up. this involves making a verb match the subject. for example  when you have the verb  jump   it will be conjugated as   i jump    you jump   he jumps   and so on.   start with the present tense first and give the student lots of practice using this tense. move onto past and future tense one at a time.    there are some irregular verbs that don t follow the regular verb conjugation rules. one of these is  to be.  teach this as   i am    you are    he is   and so on.   start with teaching the present tense first. irregular verbs can be tricky. in addition   to be  serves as a foundation for many other types of verb phrases. it s important to master it before moving on.    if the student wants to disagree with something or say she did not do something  she will need to know how to construct that sentence. show the student where to add  not  in a sentence. for example  you might say   i am not jumping  or  i am not eating.     diagramming a sentence is a useful exercise to help students understand how sentences are constructed.find the subject and predicate  verb  of the sentence. find direct objects and indirect objects. discuss which words alter the meaning of other words.  identify dependent and independent clauses.    once your students have grasped present  past and future verb tenses  introduce them to other types of verb conjugations. these might include present perfect simple  past progressive  present progressive  present conditional  past conditional  and so on.  when you re teaching beginning grammar  it might be better to use simple terms to describe concepts. as you teach more advanced grammar  you may choose to start introducing the proper terms that describe grammatical concepts.    periodically  assess your students  learning with quizzes. this will give them a chance to put their knowledge to the test. this also gives you a chance to see how well they are learning the concepts. you will also see if concepts are confusing to students.    take examples from sentences so that they make sense to the student. it is helpful to see how grammar rules are put into practice in different types of conversations or writings.    explain grammatical rules by using concepts that the student already knows.for example  students will likely be familiar with verb tenses  such as past  present and future. use these as ways to explain more complicated verb tenses.    reinforce your lesson by giving the students lots of time to put their grammar knowledge to use. the point of learning grammar is to improve communication skills. give your students the opportunity to practice frequently.    it is important to take note of your students  learning levels  interests and styles. when you tailor your instruction to their level  they will be more invested in learning grammar. this will also reduce frustration and confusion for both the students and yourself.  grammar can be a dry subject if the teacher doesn t engage the students effectively. play games  plan conversation scenarios and do other activities that are appropriate and fun for the students.    do not discourage your students by correcting their grammar in a way that reduces their desire to speak. instead  correct errors by continuing the conversation and asking questions using the correct grammar.for example  your student says   i catched the ball.  don t respond with  you mean  you caught the ball.  instead  say   you caught the ball  did you score a point   continue the conversation with a gentle correction and an added question or comment.  
query	58	apply free education get an affordable college education  applying to as many schools as you can will greatly increase the chances of getting a lower cost or even a free college education. while it can get expensive to apply to dozens of colleges  you should look at the average cost to submit an application and apply to as many places as you can afford.studies have shown that if you

credits you can transfer. find out whether four year colleges and universities in your area accept transfer credit and how much they re willing to let you transfer.    while you may prefer to move away from home  staying within your state can save you a lot of cash. consider applying to state universities to take advantage of your in state residency  or establish residency somewhere else before applying to schools in that state.residents of a state can get tuition rates significantly cheaper than out of state students would get. at the university of texas at austin  for example  in state tuition is almost  24 000 cheaper than out of state tuition. public state universities are the most likely schools to offer deep discounts for in state residents. if you re planning on moving out of state  either for a better school or for unrelated reasons  establish your residency at least 12 months before classes would start. some states and schools require even longer to establish residency  so check online well in advance.    some colleges and universities will help you earn your degree as quickly as possible. there are a number of ways to do this  though it will typically require more vigorous work on your part to make it happen.some colleges will accept advanced placement credits from high school. most schools let you opt to take summer classes  which can help shave off a semester or two from your estimated completion time. if you take heavy course loads during the regular school year  you can also trim off some of the time it would typically take to complete your studies.    when you ve settled on a school  you should apply for any and all scholarships and grants that you re eligible for. these can help significantly defray the cost of tuition  and may even be applicable to other expenses like books or room and board.apply to any and all scholarships offered by the school you choose. you may also be eligible for outside scholarships from various foundations and organizations.  you may find yourself disappointed with the amount of funding being offered after getting some financial aid offers from a couple of schools. if this happens  try reaching out to the financial aid offices at those schools to see if they can offer you anything better. it may not always work  but it never hurts to try petitioning for more financial aid.write a letter to the financial aid office at any school s  you re considering and describe your finances  family situation  and any other important factors affecting your ability to pay for college. let the financial aid office know about any other offers you ve received from other schools  and stress that you d really prefer to attend their institution if they can offer you better funding. don t be rude or demanding  but offer a genuine request with courtesy and sincerity.    whether you get a scholarship or not  you should still apply for federal student aid. the free application for federal student aid  fafsa  is available online and will help determine your eligibility for additional sources of funding  such as work study programs and student loans.make sure you complete your fafsa application before your chosen school s priority deadline to ensure you get the most financial aid possible.in addition to your school s deadline  you ll need to make sure you meet both state and federal deadlines for completing and submitting your fafsa materials.  depending on your chosen career path  you may be able to knock out some or all of your student debt through public service programs. the amount of time you ll have to spend in public service may vary  depending on the program you enroll in and the type of work you ll be doing.many teachers are able to pay off their student debt by working post graduate teaching assignments with in need school districts. some law school graduates may be able to join a public service program where student debt is paid off by working as a staffer for a member of congress. find out more about these and other federal programs by searching online or contacting a representative of the program.    military service has been a long standing means of getting an affordable college education for many individuals. you can get a tuition free college education and living stipend in exchange for a commitment to military service  and you may be able to customize your military career to meet your professional goals.the terms and length of your service will vary  depending on the branch you enlist in and the program of study you choose.    depending on your ability to multitask  you may be able to work while you attend school full time. however  this can easily get in the way of your studies and make it difficult to balance your time. if that s the case  you can still work during summer and winter break to make a little extra cash between semesters.   find work nearby so that you don t have to worry about commuting from school to work or vice versa. look for jobs with flexible hours. let your employer know up front that you re a student and that your education comes first.    if you re really in need of money for college you can always ask other family members for assistance. some people may be reluctant to ask for help. however  if your family is well off it can reduce the amount of aid you re eligible for  so it may not hurt to ask your parents or grandparents about the possibility of getting some assistance.ask tactfully and politely. never demand money or assistance from anyone. say something like   you know i hate to have to ask for help  but it would really mean a lot to me if i could attend       to study       and become a      . is there any way you might be able to help me go to college      living away from campus is usually cheaper than living in a dorm or on campus apartment  but not always. in some high rent cities  the on campus options may be more affordable. the tradeoff is that you re not on campus for all the convenience and socialization that comes with living in the dorms  but you can save hundreds or even thousands of dollars by renting your own place.assess your living options  both on campus and off campus  by comparing dorm costs to the average advertised rent price off campus. then choose the less expensive option. you can find apartment listings online or in your local newspaper. look around at different neighborhoods and different types of housing to get a feel for what s available in your price range.    one easy way to make living off campus a little cheaper is to find alternate ways of commuting. the biggest downside to living off campus is the commute  so by making it cheaper  or free  to get to and from class  you can pocket that extra cash and put it towards your rent  tuition  or book expenses.walk  bike  or take public transportation whenever possible. if you live with or near other students  ask them about carpooling together. you can take turns driving or chip in gas money to a designated carpool driver so that everyone shares transportation costs.    having roommates can help defray the cost of renting an apartment or home. however  living with other people also has its disadvantages  including a loss of privacy and a potentially noisy living situation. if you need a cheap place to live  though  splitting the cost with one or more other people may help you save.find roommates you can trust. you ll want to know that your roommates won t throw wild parties during finals week or invite untrustworthy people into your home. if you have people you re already friends with  ask them about living together. if not  make sure you meet your potential roommates in advance and try to get to know them a little before moving in together.    even if your tuition is paid for  you ll still have to worry about the cost of textbooks. some books cost over  100 each and will only be used for one semester. instead of paying out hundreds of dollars for your course texts  find ways of getting your books cheaper or even for free.   buying used textbooks is a great way to cut down on costs. you can get the same textbook for significantly less than a new book would cost   just make sure it s the most up to date edition that you need for class. consider renting books instead of buying them. some bookstores and online retailers allow you to borrow textbooks for a semester and then return them  and you can also find textbooks for rent at the school library.    it may sound obvious  but the most expensive way to get an education is to leave college without a degree.if you re going to be saddled with any kind of debt  you might as well get your money s worth by earning a degree. that degree can unlock many career opportunities for you in the future  and you ll be more likely to escape debt by landing a higher paying job than if you don t get a degree.   talk to career counselors and other specialists on campus if you re having trouble keeping your grades up or staying in school. these professionals can help you develop and stick to a plan that leads to graduation.

query	60	say belief develop your own beliefs  it can take time to become aware of the beliefs that drive your life. you can more effectively do this by backing off from others for a time. if you want to develop your own beliefs  you will need some distance from others so that you can more adequately tune into your own mind.   take a weekend getaway to a quiet place where you can think. or  if you can t afford a vacation right now  simply isolate yourself at home or in your room for a day or so.    the development of beliefs doesn t happen consciously. therefore  if you wish to form your own  you will need to bring consciousness to those that already guide your life. you can audit your current belief system by training yourself to pay close attention to the relationship between your thoughts and actions. use the abc model.a stands for the activating event. example  your professor scolds you for submitting an assignment late. b stands for the belief. example  you think   i can t do anything right.  c stands for the consequence  or subsequent actions . example  you don t try as hard to get things turned in on time.    tuning into your thoughts and their underlying beliefs is like a muscle the more you use it  the more it grows. journaling is a great way to recognize your thought patterns. begin a free writing practice each day in which you simply write down whatever is on your mind. once you have dumped out all those thoughts  review what you wrote.train yourself to find the thoughts and core beliefs that drive your behaviors.    previously  when you had no awareness of your thoughts  many negative beliefs went unchallenged. take the time to challenge your interpretation of various belief systems. ask yourself whether your core beliefs are helpful and rational. discard the beliefs that do not positively influence your life.for instance  you believe   i can t do anything right.  such a belief certainly does not serve your life. you can search for other possible explanations behind it  like  i need to work harder  or  i need to develop better time management skills.  by challenging and reframing beliefs like this  you can ensure that your current belief system is positive and growth oriented.    one of the most powerful ways to expand your worldview and develop your own beliefs is by seeing new places. oftentimes  your pre existing belief system is built around your own narrow experience. when you see the world beyond your own community  your experience broadens  and so do your beliefs.plan to explore as much as you can. depending on your budget  this might include visiting new states  countries  or continents. however  you don t have to travel far to get a new perspective. consider taking a foreign culture course at your local college or visiting a museum in your area.    when you engage with people who are different than you  you can learn more about their belief system. in turn  you may better inform yourself on what beliefs suit you best. strike up a conversation with someone whose background is different than your own.they could have an alternative political perspective  be from a different culture  or have been raised with a unique lifestyle. if you are too nervous to chat with others  you might start out reading books about people who lead different lifestyles.    exploring new activities and ways of being can push you out of your comfort zone. as a result  you may develop new beliefs about yourself and the world around you.   challenge yourself to learn a new skill like salsa dancing. learn another language. eat in a foreign restaurant. include different colors or prints in your wardrobe than usual.  many people s belief systems are grounded in moral decisions of right and wrong. you can empower your own belief system by experimenting with different spiritual practices or religious beliefs.visit a different church or place of worship. start a meditation practice. or  spend more time in nature. this might be challenging if the ideas are drastically different from what you were raised to believe. take your exploration slowly by finding small ways to explore  e.g. reading a book versus attending a worship service  until you feel more comfortable.    after you have reviewed your pre existing beliefs and explored alternatives  it can help to try to define your personal values. an important part of developing a belief system is figuring out what you stand for  and your values are basically the causes you consider important.   you can pinpoint your personal values by reflecting on times when you felt the happiest  most proud or satisfied. what was happening during these times  try to label the factors that contributed to these feelings.in addition to reflection exercises  you can also complete a values inventory like the personal values assessment.  a big part of establishing your own belief system is making your ideas known to others. each time you share your beliefs with someone else  you affirm them. also  you can make your position clear with others who try to influence your beliefs.for instance  if your belief system has changed from that of family or friends  you might inform them. say something like   well  actually my views on that have changed   then  briefly share your new position. when you share your beliefs with others  avoid doing so defensively. simply speak with polite confidence.    if your new belief system is drastically different than that of your family members or friends  your disclosure may be met unfavorably. prepare yourself for negative reactions  but don t allow their disapproval to make you doubt your decisions. remember that everyone is entitled to their own beliefs  even if those closest to you don t agree.a good way to respond is with open mindedness and honesty. you might say   i know this may come as a shock to you. but i m happy to answer any questions you have.  give them  and yourself  time to come to terms with a change in beliefs. over time  your loved ones may come to support your beliefs  or at least not actively oppose them.    once you have confirmed your new belief system  regularly audit your everyday actions to be sure they are in line with your beliefs. you are happiest when your daily actions and choices support your core values and beliefs. plus  when you live by your beliefs  you are able to be your most authentic self.  even after you have developed your own belief system  expect it to morph over time. as you travel  learn new things  meet new people  and have new life experiences  your perspective on various beliefs will likely change. this is completely normal  and okay.
query	61	teach tagalog language teach your children a second language  the very first thing in teaching a child how to learn something is lowering yourself down to the child s age. in short  your understanding mentality should be of that age of the child. children s brains are fairly different to adult brains   not just in size but also in processing. so when teaching a child  take it slow. it is tempting to just jump right in and try to teach them big phrases and ask them to recite them back to you. this is called mimicking. all the child is really doing just repeating what you have said without knowing what it means.    a good thing to do is buy little toy animals or show pictures of animals to help teach the child what they are called.    the younger the child is  the more likely they ll forget what you taught them yesterday. so  this stage of the child s learning is all about repetition. you do not have to do a lot of it. once the child can repeat the object s name or can retrieve the item you might have ask them to bring  then you are good to go on to the next stage.    one fun game is to hide the toy animals or pick random objects around the room you are teach them in  and ask them to bring it to you. but it is best to switch it up once in a while  kids are quick to pick up on patterns.    at this point you can either do both teaching them how to read  can do this also in beginning  and speak or just speak. start out with small phrases then go up to step by step.    it will be best if the child is taught to talk to you in the language only versus just using the language when needed. this way the child will not forget it  even if they only talk to you.   nan  one way children learn language is by being social with people who also know the language. this way  it helps promote good conversation skills.    don t frustrate your child by doing this early on  though.

query	66	receive property insurance file a car insurance claim  the most common type of situation in which you d need to file an insurance claim is when your car is involved in an auto accident. however  you should also file a claim if your car is vandalized or stolen.    the explanation and fine print of car insurance policies appear to be long winded and often seem extremely complicated.

is in the event of an accident or other automotive mishap  and what your insurance company s responsibility is in such an incident.   you might need to pay a deductible    a fee to help cover the costs of the accident    if you re found to be at fault. if you re not at fault  your insurance company might be able to help you recover the deductible from the driver who is at fault.  you might also be able to find it among your insurance policy documents or on the insurance company s website. contact the insurance company as soon as possible so you can find out what their specific claims

query	68	allow separation of church and state file for separation  while any attorney would technically work  you should look to hire a lawyer who specializes in family law. family law is a field of practice that focuses on marriage  divorce  child custody  and other issues related to the family. specifically  you should try and find an attorney who is experienced with separations and divorces.

about your situation. let them know what you are going through and ask them for advice. they may be able to recommend a good divorce or separation lawyer. if you get some ideas about lawyers from your friends and family  be sure to ask about their experience.   ask them what side the attorney represented  i.e.  plaintiff or defendant   whether the attorney was transparent and honest about their fees and services  whether the attorney was punctual and professional  and whether the attorney seemed informed about the legal issues at hand.    after talking to friends and family  you may want to broaden your search to include online sources. often  attorneys will have their own websites or will have profiles with professional referral services. check these sources and make a list of possible choices.   to start this process  do an online search for divorce and separation lawyers in your area. click on some websites that seem reputable and professional. some examples include avvo  findlaw  and lawyers.com.    every state has their own bar association. these organizations help manage the lawyers within their jurisdiction  and they often have a referral service or a list of attorneys that practice in a particular area of the law.   in addition  these websites will often tell you how long an attorney has been practicing  their areas of expertise  and if they have ever been in trouble.    after talking with those close to you  looking online  and checking with your local bar association  narrow your results and come up with three to five top choices. the factors that help you narrow your choices will depend on your personal situation  finances  and your  gut feeling  about an attorney.if you ve asked for references from others and researched those references online  you should have a decent sense of who will be good candidates. however  you should definitely arrange to meet with at least three attorneys in person before you make a final decision. it s important to test your

states offer self help information online. for example  california s government website offers guidance to people wishing to go through the separation process on their own.  not every state recognizes legal separation. states that do not do so include delaware  florida  georgia  louisiana  mississippi  pennsylvania  and texas.even if your state does offer legal separation  you need to check with your local laws regarding any special conditions  procedures  or qualifications.   in states that do not offer legal separation  you will likely be able to enter into a specific contract called a post nuptial agreement.a post nuptial agreement allows you and your spouse to split property  create a child custody arrangement and agree to spousal payments. however  if you have to go to court  a post nuptial agreement will be dealt with under normal contract law  not under family law doctrines.    in order to file for separation  you will need to meet your state s residency requirements.if you and or your spouse have lived in the state long enough to meet these residency requirements  you will be able to file for separation in that state.   for example  in ohio  either you or your spouse must have lived in the state for at least 6 months prior to filing for divorce. additionally  you must have been a resident of the county where you file for divorce for at least 90 days prior to filing.   in most states  permissible grounds for separation will be identical to the permissible grounds for divorce.generally  valid causes include incompatibility  abandonment  adultery  and cruelty.in california  you must base a separation on incurable insanity or irreconcilable differences.  before starting the formal separation process  you need to sit down and talk with your spouse. talk about how you both see the separation going. if you and your spouse both think the separation can be completed amicably  consider putting together a separation agreement. however  if you and your spouse are having trouble agreeing on the terms of your separation  you will need to file a formal complaint with the court. have this discussion at the beginning of the process so that you can make the best decision possible.    if you and your spouse are on the same page  sit down and prepare a separation agreement. a separation agreement is a written contract between you and your spouse resolving issues about property division  debts  custody  and support.there are usually no court forms available for a separation agreement. such agreements are typically drafted in the same manner as any contract between parties.the separation agreement becomes legally binding when signed by both parties and notarized. it can be enforced if the terms are violated by the other spouse.   be clear and concise when providing information. for example  instead of writing   respondent will have visitation on weekends   you may want to write   respondent shall have visitation with the parties  minor children every other weekend from 6 p.m. friday to 6 p.m. sunday.  if you want  you can find a document preparation service online. online preparation service providers allow you to have your legal documents prepared without ever having to leave your home. generally  once you and your spouse have prepared the separation agreement  you will still need to file for legal separation. when you get to your court hearing  you and your spouse will present the judge with the separation agreement and you will have the judge make it a part of the separation order.  whether you have created a separation agreement or not  you will still need to fill out a petition for legal separation. a petition is a formal request asking a court to grant a particular action  in this case a separation . within a legal separation  you will need to tell the court about your marital situation and the type of relief you want.   for example  in california  you will need to download and fill out fl 100  the petition for dissolution and separation.when you fill it out  you need to check the box marked separation.then you will need to explain you and your spouse s legal relationship  how you meet the residency requirements  any children you have  the grounds for your separation  and how you want the court to handle property division  child support  spousal support  and child custody.  once you have filled out your petition  you will need to file it  along with any other required documents  with the clerk of courts in the county where you reside. bring two copies of everything when you personally file your papers. when the original and all of the copies are presented to the clerk  he or she will stamp them all  filed  and will return the two copies to you   one for your records and one for you to serve on your spouse.   in california  if you have children under 18  you will also file a declaration under uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act.this form tells the judge who your children are and where they have been living.  when you file your petition  you will be required to pay a filing fee. every jurisdiction has different fees  so be sure to check with your local court before filing. if you cannot afford the filing fee  you may be able to get a fee waiver. in order to do so  you will need to convince the judge of your inability to pay.   for example  in new york  the filing fee is  210.00  payable by cash  certified check  money order  or credit card.  personal service of process on your spouse is the formal delivery of your court papers in order to officially notify them that they are a party in a lawsuit and that a response is required. you must have a third party serve the petition. you can make the service of process as follows    personal delivery   this entails using a third party service that specializes in delivering court papers. substituted service   this method requires two separate steps. first  you must deliver the papers to a person of suitable age and discretion  who is willing to accept the papers  at an acceptable location  e.g.  your spouse s house  business  etc. . next  you must mail the papers by first class mail to your spouse at their last known residence. you may also mail them to your spouse s actual place of business.  you must mark the envelope used for the mailing  personal and confidential.  also  you must not show in any way that the envelope contains papers about a legal action against the person being served.      once your spouse has been served  he she will have a certain time period within which they must respond. if they fail to respond within the time limit  a judge will likely enter a default ruling in your favor. if your spouse agrees with all of your requests  he she might not contest the separation. if your spouse disagrees with things that were said in the petition  he she will contest the separation.    in some states  you may be able to attend court ordered mediation before a judge will entertain your separation request. during mediation  a neutral third party will sit down with you and your spouse and discuss your separation. you and your spouse will try to work out the details of your separation amicably. if you can do so  you and your spouse will put together a separation agreement with the help of the mediator. the mediator will then present that agreement to the court  along with their own recommendation.   if you and your spouse have already formulated a separation agreement on your own  you do not usually need to go through this process. if this is the case  tell the judge that you have already reached an agreement.    you must appear in court for a hearing unless you and your spouse have reached an agreement that resolves all issues concerning the terms and conditions of separation. at the hearing  the judge will review evidence and listen to testimony before ruling on the contested issues.    after the hearing  your judge will sign their ruling. the ruling will set forth the conditions of your separation. it will be legally binding and you and your spouse will be required to obey its terms.   in some states  once the judge has issued their ruling  you may have to obtain a copy of the ruling and file it with the clerk of courts. once you file the judgment  it will become official.

query	70	watch history of television watch less tv  at some point in recent history  it became popular to put televisions in every room of the house. but having access to tv everywhere you turn only leads to unnecessary viewing. limit your tv watching to one room of your house to reduce temptation and ultimately watch less tv.  using a television recording device  like tivo or dvr  can allow you to save the tv shows that you like. having your favorite tv shows saved will reduce the time you spend aimlessly browsing and flipping channels  causing you to watch less tv.  keeping your tv in a cabinet  with a door that closes  or simply placing a tapestry over it when it is not in use can lead to a reduction in your tv time. when you can t see the tv  you are much less likely to turn it on.  many people today are ditching their cable in favor of internet television services  like netflix or hulu. once again  this practice eliminates the ability to mindlessly flip channels and leads to less time in front of the tv.  if you make it more difficult for yourself to watch tv  it gives you a better opportunity to exercise some willpower. one way to achieve this is to unplug your tv when it s not in use. keeping your tv plugged in actually wastes quite a bit of energy  so pulling the plug is also a great choice for your pocketbook and the earth.  you have probably heard that the first step to tackling a problem is to admit that you have one. if you suspect that you might be watching too much television  take a week to prove it. for one week  watch as much television as you normally do  but keep a log. at the end of the week add it up  and astonish yourself with how much time you ve been wasting in front of the screen.once you have your weekly amount  think about all the other things you could have done with that time. it could have been 10 hours studying  15 hours at the gym  or 20 hours practicing guitar.    one popular tactic is to allow yourself only a certain number of hours  or minutes  of tv time per day. start by limiting yourself to one hour per day. then  once you are comfortable with that amount  maybe try to do half an hour per day  or one hour every other day.  rather than simply giving yourself tv time each day  for free   you may want to use tv as a reward. for example  if you work out for 45 minutes  maybe this earns you 45 minutes of tv time. if you finish that letter you ve been meaning to write  maybe this earns you another 15. this way  you re still getting your hour to unwind in front of the tv  but you ve also completed some important tasks in the process.you may want to create a list that details the number of tv minutes certain tasks are worth. you may still want to enforce a daily cap  such as 1 2 hours .    eating in front of the television is an addicting habit. not only has this been shown to have negative effects on your waistline  but it encourages longer and more frequent tv watching. break the habit  focus on eating your food when its time to eat  and pay close attention to the tv when it is time for tv.  you can use any trick in the book  but ultimately your choice to watch less tv is going to come down to willpower. willpower is like a muscle  the more you exercise it  the stronger it becomes. watching less television is an important lifestyle adjustment that can have very positive benefits for you. try to be strong and follow the goals you have set for yourself.  exercise seems to be the answer to everything  right  well studies have actually shown that people who exercise regularly have a lowered desire to watch tv  so not only will getting active distract you and give you something else to do  but if you commit to do doing it regularly  it will lessen your tv addiction.  it is common for people to flip on the television anytime that they feel lonely. if you find yourself in this position  turn off the tv and phone a friend instead. that conversation will definitely be more uplifting and better at countering feelings of loneliness than another episode of mad men.    if you and the people you live with are huddled up around the tv every night  try changing the scene and pull out some board games. board games can be a lot of fun for people of all ages. depending on the game  they encourage interaction  cooperation  strategy  critical thinking  and having a sense of humor. start up a game and then look around  you are sure to see a room full of smiles.  if you really craving some form of passive entertainment  try listening to a podcast. podcasts exist on almost any subject and in a variety of genres  comedy  storytelling  non fiction  etc.  but listening to podcasts still helps you reduce your screen time. best of all  podcasts are totally portable  you can tune in from your car  the bus  or walking down the street.find podcasts through a podcast app  the itunes store  or through a basic internet search.    if you really have the itch to take in some audio visual entertainment  take yourself to the movies instead of lounging on the couch. going to the movies is a great way to get out of the house  it s a fun activity to do on a date or with a friend  and it creates a much more immersive experience than watching tv at home. plus  a movie is presented in a limited quantity  you ll only watch those 90  or so  minutes  and then you ll be done.

query	72	improve apgar score read an apgar score  even though apgar refers to the designer s name  it can also be used as an acronym   apgar  can stand for appearance  skin color   pulse  grimace response  reflexes   activity  muscle tone   and respiration. this test is used to measure the overall well being of the baby by looking at the major indicators of wellness.  the first category is appearance. in this part of the test  the medical staff will look at the baby s skin color. the skin color can indicate whether the baby is receiving enough oxygen or not.a zero in this category means the baby is blue all over. a one means the baby is mostly a healthy color but may be bluish at the hands and feet. a two means the baby is a healthy color all over  including pink at the hands and feet.    the next category on the apgar test is heart rate. a nurse  doctor  or midwife will check for the baby s heartbeat. the medical staff will also determine the pulse rate to see how the baby is thriving.if the baby doesn t have a heart rate  the score is zero. a score of one indicates a heart rate under 100 beats per minute  which is not quite as fast as it should be. a score of two indicates the baby s heart rate is over 100  which means the baby is thriving in this particular category.    the grimace response is how the baby reacts to mild stimulus. for instance  the baby may be lightly pinched to see if the baby responds a lot or if it doesn t respond at all to the stimulus.a zero indicates no response. a one means the baby pulls a face  grimaces  but doesn t sneeze or cough. a two means the baby pulls a face and either cries  pulls away  sneezes  or coughs in response.    next comes a check of muscle tone. muscle tone just measures the baby s activity to see if it is moving around on its own. an active baby indicates that they are doing well.a zero indicates the baby is limp or not moving much at all. if the baby is given a one  it means they are moving with smaller or less active motions  but they are not as vigorous as the doctor would prefer. a two means the baby is actively moving around.    the last category on the apgar test is breathing. a person on the medical staff examines the baby to see how they re breathing  then assigns a number to the breathing effort from zero to two based on what they observe.a zero means the baby is not breathing  while a one means the baby has irregular breathing. a two means is the baby is breathing just fine  which usually means the baby is both breathing and crying with normal effort and at a normal rate.    the score from the apgar is generally taken as a whole rather than in individual categories. in other words  all the scores from each category are added together to get one number. the best possible score is ten  which means the baby is doing as well as they can be. however  most babies don t score a ten at birth.a score from seven to ten means the baby will just need standard care. if the score is under seven  the baby will need more monitoring and possibly interventions  such as help breathing.  while a low score may seem scary  it usually doesn t mean the baby will have long term health effect. rather  it just means the baby needs a little extra care right after birth to help stabilize their health.certain factors can cause the apgar score to be lower. often  it s caused by a c section  premature birth  or a birth that s a bit more difficult than other births. a low score can also be caused by fluid in the airway.    if the baby has a low score  generally one of two things will happen. with the first intervention  the baby s airway will be cleared out if it has fluid  and the baby will be given oxygen. a second option is the baby may be given stimulation to get the heart beating more rapidly.keep in mind that if these basic interventions do not work  the medical team will do whatever is necessary to improve the baby s condition. this can vary based on the causes of the score.    generally  the baby will be placed somewhere warm while the test is performed. that can either be on a parent s belly or under a warmer. keeping the baby warm is important.  as the name implies  the one minute test is performed a minute after the baby leaves the mother s body. it tells the medical staff how well the baby did during the birthing process and accesses the baby s need for assistance.  the five minute test  as it sounds  is given five minutes after birth. this test is the same as the one minute test  but it s given to measure how the baby is doing out in the world  out of the womb .this test also helps evaluate whether any interventions are working.  while the test is usually just performed twice  it may be given a third time if the baby has a low score. usually  it s given at the ten minute mark to see if the baby has improved any from the five minute test.

to do when your asthma is flaring.everyone will have a different action plan as everyone experiences asthma differently.for instance  if the person suffering from asthma is a student  his action plan would include permission to take his medicine at school.the action plan should include emergency phone numbers  a list of triggers to avoid  flare up symptoms and what to do when they appear  plus how to prepare before exercise so you don t have an attack.    medication is usually the foundation of asthma treatment. medication prescribed by your doctor can help keep the disease under control and prevent asthma attacks.there are two types of oral and inhaled asthma medication your doctor may prescribe  and most people take both at the same time    anti inflammatories that reduce swelling and mucus in your airways. this can make breathing easier. bronchodilators that relax the muscles around your airways to improve breathing rate and the amount of oxygen in your lungs.  oral or inhaled medications that control inflammation can be the most important for a person with asthma. they reduce swelling and mucus in your airways and can help control or prevent asthma symptoms if taken daily.your doctor might prescribe an inhaled corticosteroid such as fluticasone  budesonide  ciclesonide  or mometasone.it may take daily use over a longer period of time for these medications to have their full effect and they come with few side effects.your doctor may prescribe leukotriene modifier such as montelukast  zafirlukast  or zileuton to help prevent and relieve symptoms for up to 24 hours.use these drugs carefully  however  as they are linked to psychological reactions including agitation and aggression.fortunately  these reactions are rare. your doctor may also give you a mast cell stabilizer such as cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium.for severe symptoms not controlled by other methods  your doctor may prescribe short or long courses of oral steroids. these have more possible side effects  so are only used when other treatments aren t effective or when acute symptoms are severe.    bronchodilators come as short  or long term medications. short term bronchodilators  which are often called rescue inhalers  relieve or stop symptoms and can help during attacks.long term bronchodilators help control symptoms and prevent attacks.for some people  pre treating with medication before exercise can reduce asthma symptoms caused by exercise. your doctor might prescribe a long acting beta agonist such as salmeterol or formoterol.these can open your airways  but may also increase your risk of a severe asthma attack. you will usually take them with a corticosteroid.you may also use a combination inhaler such as fluticasone salmeterol  or mometasone formoterol.ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic drug that can help control acute or new asthma symptoms. theophylline is a long acting bronchodilator which is rarely used for asthma anymore except in certain situations.    studies have shown that allergy medications can alleviate asthma symptoms  especially if they are a result of allergies.talk to your doctor about taking allergy meds for asthma.allergy shots may decrease your body s reaction to allergens over the long term.nasal steroids such as fluticasone may reduce allergy symptoms and thus reduce asthma triggers. oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine  cetirizine  loratadine  and fexofenadine may reduce or relieve your asthma symptoms. your doctor can prescribe or recommend an antihistamine for you.    this treatment  which uses heat to limit the ability of airways to tighten  is not widely available. speak to your doctor about bronchial thermoplasty if you have severe asthma that doesn t improve with other treatments.bronchial therapy requires that you undergo three outpatient hospital visits.the treatment heats the insides of your airways  which reduces the amount of smooth muscle that can contract and limit your air intake.the results of bronchial thermoplasty last for up to a year  which means you may need repeat treatments in subsequent years.  asthma is often worse following exposure to environmental factors that trigger symptoms. limiting or avoiding triggers can minimize your symptoms or prevent attacks.add avoid exposure to very hot or cold weather. cover your face if you are out in the cold or wind. keep your immunizations up to date  especially a yearly flu shot  to reduce infections that can trigger an asthma attack. avoid smoking and secondhand smoke if you have asthma  as smoke is a significant trigger of asthma symptoms. use an air conditioner to reduce airborne pollen circulating indoors. reduce the dust in your home through daily vacuuming or removing carpeting. cover mattress  pillows  and box springs in a dust proof cover if you are allergic to pets  keep them out of the house  or at least out of your room. clean regularly to remove dust  pet dander  mold spores and pollen.avoid exposure to pollens or air pollution by limiting the time you spend outside.reduce psychological stress.  keep yourself healthy with diet  exercise  and regular doctor s visit to help relieve symptoms of asthma. conditions like obesity and heart disease may exacerbate or cause asthma.exercise regularly to strengthen your heart and lungs. this may also help manage your weight.eat a healthy  balanced  and regular diet. consuming recommended daily amounts of fruits and vegetables may even help lung function and reduce asthma symptoms.  there is some evidence that heartburn and gerd  or gastroesophageal reflux disease  may damage airways and make asthma worse. speak to your doctor and treat both conditions  which may help any symptoms of asthma you experience.  there is some evidence that using deep breathing exercises in conjunction with medication can help control symptoms and reduce how much medication you need.it can also relax you  which may relieve psychological stress that exacerbates asthma.   deep breathing helps distribute oxygen in your body. this can reduce your heart rate  normalize your pulse  and relax you  all of which may help control asthma.inhale and exhale completely through your nose. you may want to breathe to a specific count. for example  you can inhale to a count of four and then exhale for the same number.to optimize your deep breathing  sit upright with your shoulders back. breathe slowly and evenly  pulling in your belly to expand your lungs and rib cage.  some studies have shown that herbal and natural remedies may help control asthma. speak to your doctor before using these remedies.look for products containing black seed  caffeine  choline  and pycnogenol  as these may help relieve asthma symptoms.mix three parts tincture of lobelia with one part tincture of capsicum. take twenty drops of this mixture in water to help a severe asthma attack.eat ginger and turmeric  which may help decrease inflammation.  doctors don t know what causes asthma  but they are aware that certain factors increase your risk for the disease.learning whether you are at risk for asthma can help you identify symptoms and get treatment.risk factors include having a blood relative with asthma having allergic conditions like atopic dermatitis or allergic rhinitis being overweight being a smoker or exposing someone else or yourself to secondhand smoke working with or being exposed to exhaust fumes or other pollutants    asthma has a variety of signs and symptoms ranging from mild to severe. recognizing potential symptoms have can help you get proper treatment.some of the symptoms of asthma include shortness of breath tightness or pain in the chest sleeping difficulties coughing  especially with exercise  acute attacks  or during the night whistling or wheezing sounds when breathing    if your think you might have asthma  see your doctor. if she thinks you may have asthma  she may order tests after examining you. the following kinds of tests may be the only way to confirm asthma spirometry  which examines how much your bronchial tubes narrow and how much air you can exhale after a deep breath. peak flow meter tracking  to determine your ability to exhale.methacholine challenge  which uses an asthma trigger to see if you have asthma. nitric oxide testing to measure the amount of nitric oxide in your breath  which can confirm asthma.scans like x ray  ct  or and mri to look at the tissues of your lungs and nose cavities that can make asthma worse. allergy tests sputum eosinophils  to look for the presence of certain types of white blood cell called eosinophils.  depending on the results of your tests  your doctor may confirm a diagnosis of asthma. speak to her about the best treatment for your specific case.

query	76	suffer carpal tunnel syndrome treat carpal tunnel syndrome  the carpal tunnel within your wrist is a narrow passageway made up of small carpal bones and ligaments. the tunnel protects nerves  blood vessels and tendons that go into your hand. the main nerve that innervates your hand is called the median nerve.avoid activities that compress and irritate the median nerve such as repetitively flexing your wrist  lifting heavy weights with your hands  sleeping with bent wrists and punching solid objects.   wearing tight bracelets and watches may be a risk factor also  so make sure to leave ample space. in many cases of carpal tunnel syndrome  a single cause is difficult to identify. often it involves a combination of factors  such as arthritis or diabetes combined with repetitive strain in the wrist. the wrist anatomy of people can make a difference   some have naturally smaller passageways in their wrists or have carpal bones that are positioned oddly.    stretching your wrists on a regular basis can be effective at reducing or minimizing carpal tunnel symptoms.in particular  wrist extensions can help make more room for the median nerve in the carpal tunnel by stretching the ligaments that attach to the carpal bones. the easiest way to extend and stretch both wrists at the same time is the  prayer pose  with your palms together. put your palms together in front of your chest and raise your elbows until you feel a nice stretch in your wrists. hold for 30 seconds and repeat 3 5x daily.   you can also grab the fingers of the affected hand and pull backwards until you feel a stretch at the front of your wrist. you may feel more temporary tingling in your hand with this stretch  but don t stop unless you feel pain. in addition to hand tingling  other symptoms commonly associated with carpal tunnel syndrome are  numbness  throbbing pain  muscle weakness and color changes  too pale or too red . the only part of the wrist   hand typically spared symptoms is the little finger   it s not innervated by the median nerve.    the symptoms of carpal tunnel are often related to having inflammation   swelling in the wrist  which either directly irritates the median nerve or crowds  pinches  it. as such  taking otc non steroidal anti inflammatories  nsaids   such as ibuprofen  motrin  advil  or naproxen  aleve   can be very helpful to reduce symptoms short term.painkillers such as acetaminophen  tylenol  paracetamol  can be used for carpal tunnel also  but they don t impact swelling  only the pain.   anti inflammatories and analgesics should be considered short term strategies for pain control. there isn t any evidence that these drugs improve carpal tunnel syndrome in the long term.taking too many nsaids or taking them for too long significantly increases your risk of stomach irritation  ulcers and kidney failure. taking too much acetaminophen or taking it for too can cause liver damage. as an alternative  rub an ointment that contains a natural pain reliever into your sore wrist   hand. menthol  camphor  arnica and capsaicin are all helpful for relieving mild to moderate pain.    if your wrist is sore and looks or feels swollen  then apply a small bag of crushed ice  or something cold  to it in order to reduce inflammation and numb the pain. doing so may also reduce hand symptoms. cold therapy is most effective for soft tissue injuries that involve some sort of swelling because it reduces blood flow.apply the crushed ice to your wrist for about 5 10 minutes 3 5x daily until the symptoms subside.   compressing the ice against your wrist with a stretchy tensor or ace bandage is even more effective for fighting inflammation. always wrap ice in a thin cloth before applying it skin   it prevents skin irritation or frostbite. if crushed ice isn t available  use a large ice cube  frozen gel pack or small bag of frozen veggies instead. in some cases  cold therapy may aggravate the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. avoid ice if that s the case with you.    wearing a rigid brace or splint that holds your wrist in a neutral position during the day may reduce the compression or irritation of the median nerve and help with carpal tunnel symptoms.splints or wrist braces can also be worn during activities that aggravate symptoms  such as working at the computer  bowling or carrying groceries. wearing splints while you sleep can help relieve nighttime symptoms of tingling and numbness in your hands  especially if you have a habit of curling your wrists.you may need to wear a splint for several weeks  day and night  to get significant relief from carpal tunnel symptoms. for some sufferers  splints and braces provide negligible benefit. splinting at night can be a good idea if you re pregnant and have carpal tunnel syndrome because pregnancy tends to increase swelling  edema  in the hands and feet. wrist splints and braces can be purchased at most pharmacies and medical supply stores.    some sleeping postures can aggravate the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.sleeping with your fists clenched and wrists tucked in  flexed  is the worst position  but having your arms extended above your head is not great either. instead  sleep on your back or side with your arms at your sides  and try to keep your hands open and your wrists in a neutral position. wearing a wrist splint or brace is very helpful in this regard  although it takes a little getting used to.   don t sleep on your stomach with your hands   wrists compressed under your pillow. people who do this frequently wake up with numb and tingly hands. most wrist splints and braces are made of nylon and fasten with velcro  which can irritate other parts of your body. consider covering your splint with a sock or thin cloth to reduce irritating other body parts.    your carpal tunnel problem may be caused or aggravated by a poorly designed work station. if your computer keyboard  mouse  desk and or chair isn t positioned properly for your height and body proportions  it can put strain on your wrists  shoulders  neck and mid back. make sure your keyboard is low enough so that your wrists are not constantly bent upwards while typing.consider getting an ergonomic keyboard and mouse  designed to take the stress off your wrists and hands.   putting cushioned pads underneath your keyboard and mouse can lessen the impact on your hands and wrists. have an occupational therapist review your body positions while performing your job. people who work on computers for many hours each day are at higher risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.  if you are feeling any carpal tunnel symptoms in your wrist and hand that persist for more than a few weeks  then see your doctor for an examination. your doctor may take x rays and blood tests to rule out other causes of wrist   hand pain  such as rheumatoid arthritis  osteoarthritis  advanced diabetes  hairline fractures or vascular problems.   electrodiagnostic studies  emg and nerve conduction  are usually done to confirm the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome.your doctor will see if you can perform certain tasks that are difficult with carpal tunnel syndrome  such as  making a tight fist  pinching your thumb and forefinger together and manipulating small objects with precision.your doctor may ask about your profession  as certain jobs are at high risk  carpenters  cashiers  assembly line workers  musicians  auto mechanics and people who work on computers for long hours.    your doctor may recommend injecting the carpal tunnel area of your wrist with corticosteroid medication  such as cortisone  to relieve the pain  inflammation and other symptoms.corticosteroids are strong and fast acting anti inflammatories that can quickly decrease swelling in your wrist  which relieves pressure on the median nerve. taking oral corticosteroids  by mouth  is another option  but these drugs are not considered as effective as injections and they come with significant side effects.   other common corticosteroid medications used for carpal tunnel syndrome are prednisolone  dexamethasone and triamcinolone. potential complications of corticosteroid injections include local infection  bleeding  tendon weakening  local muscle atrophy and nerve irritation   damage. as such  injections are limited to 2 per year. if corticosteroid injections fail to significantly reduce the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome  then surgery should be considered.    if all other remedies and treatments fail to give you relief  then your doctor will likely recommend carpal tunnel surgery. surgery should be considered as a last resort  although it can completely relieve your symptoms for good with minimal risk  so it should not be considered as a long shot. the goal of surgery is to relieve pressure on the median nerve by cutting the ligament pressing on it.however  carpal tunnel surgery can be performed in two different ways  endoscopic or open surgery.   endoscopic surgery involves uses a telescope like device with a tiny camera on the end  endoscope   which is inserted through a small incision in your wrist or hand. the endoscope can see inside the carpal tunnel and cut the problematic ligament. endoscopic surgery typically results in the least amount of pain and the quickest recovery. open surgery involves making a larger incision in the palm of your hand and over your wrist in order to cut through the problematic ligament  which frees the nerve. surgery risks include  nerve damage  infection and scar tissue formation.    following the surgery  it s done on an outpatient basis   you ll be asked to often elevate your hand above your heart and move your fingers  which reduces swelling and prevents stiffness.mild pain  swelling and stiffness in the palm and wrist can be expected post surgery for up to 6 months  and complete recovery may take a year. for the first 2 4 weeks  you may be required to wear a splint or brace  although using your hand is encouraged.   most people s symptoms get much better after surgery  but recovery is often slow and gradual. on average  hand strength returns to normal 2 months after surgery.carpal tunnel syndrome can occasionally recur  about 10  of the time  and may require additional surgery.

query	78	diagnose hepatitis c recognize hepatitis c symptoms  since hepatitis c is a disease of the liver  some of its earliest and most prominent signs indicate a lack of liver function. urine that is especially dark in color may indicate your liver is not filtering out bilirubin properly.dark urine means colors that range from orange  amber  brown  or even cola colored urine. there are other things that can cause discoloration in urine such as certain vitamins in large amounts  medications  a kidney infection or even dehydration. if you notice a consistent change over the course of many days in your urine color and your medication or vitamin intake hasn t changed  make sure to get checked out by a doctor to understand the cause.    jaundice is a yellowing of the skin. it is most commonly seen in parts of the body like face  fingers  and a yellowing of the whites of eyes. much like darkly colored urine  jaundice is caused by a concentration of bilirubin  indicating that the body is not properly filtering. since hepatitis c is a liver disease  it can directly affect the liver s normal function of filtering bilirubin. if you notice your skin yellowing  you should quickly have your blood checked to make sure you do not have too much bilirubin in your body.just like dark colored urine  there are more benign explanations  such as gilbert s disease  an inherited condition with no associated complications.    clay colored stool can indicate there is a biliary system issue  the liver being a major culprit. the liver typically releases bile salts into your stool  giving it the normal brownish color. when stool does not turn brownish and remains pale  this indicates a problem that may be affecting the release of bile.   this is particularly important if you notice this in conjunction with other symptoms  such as jaundice and or dark colored urine.    although this can many times just be the flu or a common sickness  it can also be an indication that your body is in the early stages of fighting off hepatitis c. if you notice symptoms such as mild fever  fatigue  vomiting and a loss of appetite accompanied with any indication of liver malfunction  this can be an early sign of the disease. even if it is just an ordinary sickness  a doctor will be able to run simple tests to narrow down what s making you feel ill.   other common symptoms include fatigue  the most common complaint   nausea  loss of appetite  muscle pain  weakness and weight loss. several non liver related conditions are associated with chronic hepatitis c infection  including diabetes mellitus  autoimmune disorders and kidney disease.    as many as 70   80  of those who contract the disease may be asymptomatic. this early phase  known as the acute phase of hepatitis c  is often mild and can go unnoticed. it may just seem like a common ailment  with nothing too serious developing.  over time symptoms of hepatitis c can become severe. the development of cirrhosis is a common progression of hepatitis c. this is when the liver becomes so scarred and hardened by the disease it is no longer able to heal itself. the most common symptoms of cirrhosis is fluid retention in the abdominal area  jaundice  and even abnormal bleeding  particularly in the stomach or esophagus. by the time these symptoms take hold  urgent medical care is needed.between five and 30  of patients with chronic hepatitis c go on to develop cirrhosis over a 20   30 year time span. in the later stages of hepatitis c  full on liver failure may take hold. this may also bring on mental symptoms like confusion. sometimes a liver transplant may be needed but recurrence of the disease is common.  you will want to make an appointment with a primary healthcare provider who can move forward with testing  whether you re in the early or latter stages of the disease. they may refer you to a specialist in liver disease  infectious diseases  or a specialist in stomach and intestinal problems.  this test screens for infection by testing for the presence of antibodies of the disease  indicating your body is trying to fight the virus. this test is useful because it can tell whether you have an active bout of the infection your body is dealing with  or whether you previously had the disease.there is recent evidence that a weak positive may set off a false positive of the test. so depending on the level of the antibodies  you may want to be retested.most patient that contract hepatitis c develop antibodies two to six months after exposure to the virus.    this is a test that looks at genetic material  rna  of the virus. this is used to measure the viral load in your body. this is a very accurate test and is typically only done if the hepatitis c antibody test is positive  unless acute infection or recent exposure is suspected.   other types of viral load tests include  tma  transcription mediated amplification   pcr  polymerase chain reaction   and bdna  branched dna   with the latter being the least sensitive.  there are seven different genotypes of the hepatitis c virus. the genotype is important because it will dictate the type and length of treatment  as well as the likelihood of a cure.    many of the symptoms of hepatitis c can mimic other liver ailments  however  some may not appear at all. you can gain a better understanding of your risks by evaluating behaviors that may have increased the likelihood of you contracting the disease.   actions that involve the transference and exchange of blood put you at risk to contract hepatitis c  particularly if it s done carelessly. sharing drugs or needles and being stuck with an infected needle are two particularly risky behaviors. using shared tattoo needles is a sometimes the cause of hepatitis c infection  particularly in the prison population. if you have a disease that requires the legitimate use of needles  always take the utmost care to use sanitized  new needles. make sure to only use needles once and dispose of them properly. never share needles  even for medication.    blood transfusions and organ transplants done before 1992 did not adhere to standards that screened hepatitis c. if you received a transplant or blood transfusion before this date  you should get tested if symptoms appear.people with hiv can also have a greater chance of contracting hepatitis c. since their disease was likely contracted due to bodily fluid exchange   in some cases blood   the risk is higher. those who routinely receive long term kidney dialysis are more susceptible than others. hepatitis c can be passed from women to their children during childbirth. if you are a woman and your child has symptoms of hepatitis c  it may be a good idea for both of you to be checked. similarly  if you later find out your mother had hepatitis c you will want to get checked if the timeframe is possible.    hepatitis c can be contracted through unprotected sex with a carrier of the disease. avoid having unprotected sex with multiple partners  particularly if you do not know whether they may carry the disease.

feelings down in a journal.    regular physical activity during the daytime can help regulate your sleep cycle at night  which is a good strategy for combating insomnia. it can give you a boost of energy and invigorate you initially  but the strenuous effort and increased breathing of oxygen makes you tired and sleepy at night. if you don t have a regular exercise routine already  strive for at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity  walking  hiking  biking  swimming  per day.establishing an exercise routine takes effort. try to be active at the same time each day  either early in the morning  during your lunch break  or right after work before you eat. exercise also promotes weight loss  which can reduce annoying aches and pain  make you more comfortable in bed at night  and reduce the risk of snoring and other breathing problems. don t engage in vigorous exercise too close to bedtime because your body produces adrenaline and it will prevent you from falling asleep quickly. make sure your workouts occur 5 6 five hours prior to bedtime.  while alcohol may help some people fall asleep faster  it can disrupt sleep patterns and reduce the quality of your sleep. you may even find yourself waking up in middle of the night and struggling to fall asleep again. cut down on the amount of alcohol that you drink  and stop consuming any alcoholic drinks at least an hour before you go

transitioned into full blown insomnia  despite your efforts with lifestyle changes   then make an appointment with your doctor. your doctor will try to determine if you have an underlying medical condition that s causing or contributing to your insomnia. if so  then treatment should focus on the underlying heath condition first and the sleeping difficulty should then fade away secondarily.   common causes of insomnia include  chronic pain  depression  restless leg syndrome  sleep apnea  severe snoring   bladder control problems  arthritis  cancer  hyperthyroidism  overactive thyroid   menopause  heart disease  lung disease  and chronic heartburn.ask your doctor if any of your prescription drugs can potentially trigger insomnia   problematic drugs include those used for depression

your insomnia.  if your doctor thinks it s necessary or helpful  they may prescribe medication to help you get to sleep. some drugs are better for short term insomnia  recently acquired   whereas others are more powerful and better for long term  chronic  insomnia. most doctors don t prescribe drugs for insomnia in conjunction with different drugs to treat other underlying medical issues.mixing different drug classes increases the risk of side effects  see below .   first choice sleeping pills for short term insomnia include eszopiclone  ramelteon  zaleplon and zolpidem.additional prescription medications used to treat insomnia include diazepam  lorazepam  and quazepam. note that some insomnia medications can be habit forming and may come with unpleasant

list of cbt providers through your insurance.    if you have chronic  long term  insomnia that s not going away after implementing the above mentioned advice  then get a referral from your doctor to a sleep clinic. sleep clinics are run by doctors  nurses  psychologists and other health professionals with specialized training in sleeping disorders and remedies. you ll sleep overnight in the clinic while hooked up to various devices  such as a polysomnogram  that monitor your brain waves and level of consciousness.people with chronic insomnia usually don t experience much or any time in the rem  rapid eye movement  phase of sleep compared to people who sleep normally. rem sleep should occur about 90 minutes after falling asleep   intense dreams happen in this stage. people with insomnia also have difficulty initiating non rem sleep to start with  but once there  often don t transition to deep non rem and finally rem sleep.    there are many plant based remedies or natural supplements that act as mild sedatives and help to cure insomnia if there isn t an underlying medical condition. natural herbal medicine is generally very safe in terms of toxicity if you follow instructions on the

participating in a paired exchange donation  which means you will donate your kidney to a stranger on the condition that a compatible stranger also donates a kidney to your loved one.some kidney transplant centers allow you to be a good samaritan donor  which means you can initiate a chain of donations by donating your kidney to a stranger. when you donate your kidney  the recipient s loved one will donate hers  and so on and so forth. this will probably not directly impact anyone you know personally  but it will help a lot of people. if you don t want to donate your kidney while you are still alive  but you want to help someone after you die  you can register to donate all of your organs or specific organs by signing up on your specific state s registry or indicating your preferences on your driver s license.    once you have decided that you would like to donate a kidney  you must contact a transplant center in order to initiate your application. the transplant center should have a nurse available to answer all of your questions and help you decide if donation is really right for you.if you are donating to a specific person  you must contact the transplant center that has approved them for a transplant. if the person has not yet been approved  you will not be able to proceed with donating your kidney until that happens.if you are not doing a direct donation  you have a choice regarding which facility you work with. contact multiple facilities and ask questions regarding their success rates  their policies for matching donors and recipients  and the financial assistance they offer in order to choose the right one for you. consult the u.s. department of health and human services  organ procurement and transplantation network for a complete list of transplant centers in the united states.  if you want to donate to a specific person  you will need to undergo blood testing to determine if you are a match. the initial screening involves a simple blood test.you must have a compatible blood type in order to donate your kidney to a specific individual. people who have type a blood can accept blood from donors with type a or type o. people with type b blood can receive blood from people with type b or type o. people with type ab blood can receive blood from someone with any blood type. people with type o blood can only receive blood from a donor with type o blood. the antibodies in your blood must also be compatible with those in the recipient s blood. in general  the more antibodies that recipient has  the more difficult it will be to find a match. doctors also consider antigen matching. you do not need to be an exact match in order to donate  but research has found that an exact match does increase the success rate of the transplant. if you have passed all of the other tests  doctors will then perform a cross matching test  which may actually be a series of several tests. doctors will collect cells and serum  blood without the cells in it  from both the donor and the recipient and mix them together to see if the recipient s body is likely to reject the donor s organ. if these tests come back negative  you will be considered a match. keep in mind that if you are not a match for your loved one  you still have the option of participating in a paired exchange donation program  which will greatly increase the chances that your loved one will receive a kidney in a timely fashion.  in order to donate a kidney  you must be healthy enough to undergo surgery and to do well afterward with only one kidney. you also must have a sufficiently low risk of developing kidney problems in the future.your doctor will likely perform blood tests  urine tests  x rays  an ekg  and a ct angiogram to check your overall health and look for any abnormalities of your kidneys.certain chronic conditions  such as diabetes and liver disease  may disqualify you from donating your kidney. if you are a smoker  you will be required to quit at least one month before undergoing surgery to have your kidney removed.you may also be disqualified from donating a kidney if you have certain diseases that could be passed on to the recipient  such as hiv or hepatitis. you will also be required to undergo a psychological examination in order to confirm that you are aware of the risks of donating your kidney and are choosing to do it of your own free will. if you have any health conditions  you might require a pre surgical clearance from your treating doctor in order to be approved for surgery.    donating a kidney requires that you undergo major surgery  and this is not without risks. make sure to talk to your doctor about the risks before you agree to undergo surgery  and always ask if you have an increased risk of complications for any reason. although rare  some risks of surgery include the following bleeding infection blood clots in the lung  pulmonary embolism  death    kidney donors do not usually have shorter lifespans or a diminished quality of life as a result of the surgery.there are  however  some long term risks to keep in mind.   while your body is perfectly capable of functioning normally with only one kidney  you will be at a disadvantage should your remaining kidney fail. if you end up needing a kidney transplant  you will be given preference as a prior donor.kidney donors may have a somewhat higher chance of developing high blood pressure.having only one kidney may prevent you from being eligible for certain military  police  and fire fighting jobs.  most of the time  your medical expenses will be covered by either the recipient s insurance or by the transplant center if you choose to donate a kidney. make sure to find out if you will be responsible for any costs. also  keep in mind that the surgery may have many hidden costs that are not covered. the following expenses are typically not covered  although you may be able to get help with them by contacting a nonprofit agency expenses for travel to and from the transplant center childcare lost wages during your recovery period medical expenses related to long term surgical complications    there are two different surgeries your doctor may perform to remove your kidney  an open incision removal and a laparoscopic procedure. the laparoscopic procedure is much less invasive  which means there are fewer risks involved and the recovery time is shorter.a laparoscopic procedure means that instead of making a large incision and the surgeon using their hands to do the surgery inside your body  a very small set of incisions are made and instruments with long handles are inserted into the holes. the surgeon uses the instruments to do the surgery without ever opening up the abdomen. the laparoscopic procedure may not be an option for all patients  depending on their surgical histories and the anatomy of the individual s kidney and whether it can be accessed and removed with the laparoscopic instruments alone.    your doctor will give you specific instructions that you must follow prior to surgery. most commonly  you will be restricted from eating and drinking in the hours leading up to your surgery  usually beginning the night before. this is to prevent aspiration of food into your lungs when you are under anesthesia. it is very important to follow these and all other instructions  as they are meant to reduce your risk of surgical complications.make sure your doctor knows about all of the medications you are taking. you may be required to stop some medications prior to surgery.    depending on the type of surgery and a host of personal factors  recovery typically takes anywhere between one and six weeks. you should expect to experience pain  discomfort  and fatigue while you recover.it s a good idea to have a caretaker available to help you with daily activities  like preparing meals and you may have to spend a few days recovering in the hospital before you are sent home. people who are in good shape tend to recover from surgery faster than people who are out of shape  so you might want to begin an exercise regimen before your surgery.moving around in the days following your surgery will help you avoid complications  such as blood clots.  your doctor will probably have you come in for at least one post surgical check up. the purpose of this is to make sure you are healing properly  so be sure to go to all scheduled appointments.it is also important to continue getting regular medical checkups throughout your life. your doctor may want to monitor your kidney function to make sure your remaining kidney is functioning properly.    when you are released from the hospital  your doctor will give you a list of activities that you should avoid for certain periods of time. these restrictions are meant to help you heal and to protect you from injury  so it is very important that you follow them.you should not do any heavy lifting in the weeks following your surgery. your doctor will provide you with specific guidelines. depending on the type of work you do  you may not be medically cleared to return to work for several weeks. the more strenuous your job  the longer you will be out of work. women are typically advised not to become pregnant for six months after donating a kidney. some doctors recommend that kidney donors avoid contact sports like football and wrestling  due to the potential for injury to your remaining kidney.  
query	81	increase naproxen treat a back spasm  this method often works to reduce a lot of painful muscle spasms. before moving  rolling over  or getting up  place all four fingers or fingertips close to the spine and over the spasm. press down. try to move  if the muscle spasms  press harder and wait for the spasms to stop before trying to move again. when you have moved or stood up completely  wait a few seconds.          try walking with your fingers on the muscle spasms.    in the shower  turn on the hot water and focus it on your back for 2 3 minutes. alternate with a blast of cold water on the back for 30 seconds. repeat until pain has somewhat subsided.           stretching the muscle fibers can help them relax and further soothe the back spasm. always stretch before performing physical exercise.           if you are a bodybuilder  make sure to balance your back muscle training with other muscle groups.          pull ups work the upper back and biceps  but don t neglect the scapular retractor muscles. when you do exercises to work your upper back  make sure that you squeeze your shoulder blades together to strengthen these muscles. do any type of light rowing exercise  1 dumbbell  cable  elastic tube or machine  using a full range of movement. those stabbing pains between your shoulder blades will quickly disappear. rearward fly exercises can also work well if you only have light weights. doing rows with a 1 pound dumbbell may take too many repetitions  so do flys instead to save time.    whether you are lifting 25 pounds or 1 pound  follow these steps           approach the object that you plan to lift. place your feet on either side of the object  slightly behind it. bend at the waist and knees. try not to round out your spine. pick up the object. make sure you have a good grip. stand up using your thigh and butt muscles. tighten your abdominals to support your back as you stand up.    apply ice for 20 minutes  remove for 1.5 hours  then re apply for 20 minutes. repeat this cycle as often as possible during the first 2 to 3 days after a back spasm begins.          use a thin barrier between a chemical ice pack and your skin  such as a towel  so that the ice can be effective and prevent conditions such as frostbite. ice will reduce the inflammation that can cause spasms  and can effectively reduce the use of dangerous and addictive painkillers.    moist heat  such as damp heating pads  hot showers or hot tubs is usually recommended. heat helps to promote healing by drawing healthy blood cells to the area of the back spasm. heat also relaxes the nerves and muscle fibers.          try an ice heat cycle after the first 72 hours. some physical therapists suggest using heat applications before stretching and ice after stretching.  acetaminophen is a very popular otc drug for back pain  and generally has few  if any  side effects.acetaminophen  unlike non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  relieves pain by lessening its perception in the brain. there is little chance of addiction to acetaminophen  and patients tend not to develop a tolerance to the drug.           you don t have to go on strict bed rest  but you should avoid any activity that aggravates or causes back spasms including heavy lifting or certain exercises.          get plenty of rest both at night and after periods of intense back muscle use.    prolonged bed rest can be more harmful than helpful when treating back spasms.           some patients report feeling better after they elevate their legs. as you elevate your legs  try diverting the mind from the pain of the spasm and try focusing on relaxation techniques.          use pillows as simple props. lie down of a stiff mattress  or the floor  with your legs propped up or a support  or chair   maintaining a 90 degree bent on the knees. prop your feet or lower legs onto a footstool while sitting down.    since back spasms are often associated with dehydration and electrolyte loss  it s important to get enough water to drink.be especially vigilant about water intake if you live in a warm environment or are nursing an illness with fever or vomiting.           back spasms are painful  exhausting  and debilitating. know when to stop trying to treat yourself and solicit the help of a professional. call a doctor if           your back spasms are severe and unbearable. back pain and back spasms occur frequently  or have a history of occurring frequently. back spasms can be an underlying symptom of other problems. your back spasm or pain has lasted for longer than two weeks.    doctors commonly recommend over the counter naproxen or ibuprofen.          for more severe pain  your doctor may prescribe muscle relaxants or short term narcotics regimens. typically  muscle relaxants are prescribed early on in treatment  and on a short term basis. in some cases  certain tricyclic antidepressants are helpful in treating spasms. tricyclic antidepressants are commonly prescribed for pain even when a patient doesn t demonstrate depression. in most cases  your doctor should prescribe you some nsaids  or non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs. otc varietals of nsaids include ibuprofen and naproxen  but your doctor should be able to give you stronger drugs for more extreme cases.    in the beginning  these professionals will use treatments like heat  ultrasound and muscle release techniques to fight spasms. then  they should provide exercises to increase flexibility and strengthen back muscles  which can prevent pain from recurring.   some people have reported improvement of chronic back spasms after acupuncture.look for a licensed  reputable acupuncture practitioner who has experience in relieving back spasms.    a cortisone injection may provide pain relief for a few months  especially if the spasms are causing pain to radiate down your leg.
query	82	break pubis break up with your boyfriend  before breaking up with him  try to imagine your life without him  and be prepared for the possibility that you might not be able to maintain a friendship. even if you break up  realize you made a mistake  and get back together  you will have caused irreversible damage to the relationship by breaking up in the first place.   consider the advantages and disadvantages of single life. on the one hand  you will be free to date and flirt with whoever you want  but on the other hand  you will probably be spending more holidays and evenings alone. if you are truly unhappy with the relationship  don t let the thought of being alone prevent you from breaking up with him. one of the worst things you can do to both yourself and your boyfriend is to stay with him when you are unhappy. staying with him will only delay the breakup  and the longer you wait  the more damage you will do to your relationship.    asking for a break is just a bad way of saying that you want to break up. if you think you need a break from your boyfriend  then chances are that you want to break up with him but are too afraid of being single again.   remember that asking for a break isn t any easier on him than telling him you want to break up  because it still connotes the fact that you are unhappy with the relationship.    sometimes it s not the breaking up  but rather  the method by which you chose to break up that truly hurts.   don t break up with your boyfriend while he is dealing with a difficult personal problem like a death in the family  trouble at work  or other emotionally straining situation. this will be like kicking him while he is down. don t break up with him in the middle of an activity that neither of you can leave. for example  don t break up with him while you are dining at a restaurant  at the movie theater  or on a vacation together. remember that immediately following the breakup  he will probably need to be alone for a few hours to compose himself. don t break up with him in front of other people. while this may seem like common sense  you should be careful that nobody can overhear the breakup conversation while it is happening. this will add unnecessary humiliation to the situation. don t break up during a fight. you might do or say things in the heat of the moment that you will both regret later. wait until you can have a rational  adult conversation.    regardless of how long or short your relationship has been  your boyfriend deserves to be told in person. don t send him a text  facebook message  or email telling him that you want to break up.   while text or online messages may seem easier  remember that these messages don t allow you to convey emotion or tone. as a result  break up texts come across as way more  harsh  than spoken words  even if you type out what you would have said word for word. if you are in a long distance relationship  then doing it over the phone or computer might be the only option. if this is the case  then write a heart felt breakup letter that shows that you have given the breakup some thought. don t keep it too short  as this shows carelessness  but don t make it too long  as this could be torturous for him.    by this stage  beating around the bush will only confuse things and make it harder to say what needs to be said. instead  be ready beforehand with some handy phrases that will explain just what you need to say. some examples include     we ve had some great times together. but lately i ve not been feeling it and we ve also had some pretty rough patches. i ve come to the conclusion that our relationship isn t right for me and while you re a great guy  i just don t think we re destined for a long term relationship. i d like us to end on a good note today.   you re an amazing person  with so much going for you. i want you to know that i respect you and have had some great times with you. it s just that i don t feel the connection with you as a girlfriend that i d like to feel and while i ve tried to feel this  i ve finally decided that it isn t going to work. i have had a great time  i d love to stay friends but i can t honestly stay with you as your girlfriend anymore.   i m feeling unhappy in our relationship and this has not changed for weeks months. i ve tried to make things work but now i just feel that it s not going to get over the hurdles and i don t want to drag things out any further. i d like to end things between us today.     it s tough to break up and too much discussion about feelings and needs can open doors to him fighting for the relationship and having you give in to trying again. respect the things he has to say and expect him to fight for the relationship  unless he also sees it as a moment of relief  and be ready to keep it simple by repeating that it just isn t working out for you.    show that his feelings do matter but that you re not budging from your position about the relationship ending. he needs to know that you re serious and mean what you say.   be careful about saying that you ll stay friends. sometimes it s appropriate  but other times it just strings along his hopes. you will need to judge the worth of this from the context of who you both are and how the break up talk proceeds. if you re dumping him because somebody else has attracted your eye  don t tell him this. if he asks whether that s behind the break up  reassure him that it s because you don t feel the compatibility and that you re just not feeling this is a long term relationship for you. there is no need to bring a third party into the break up.    every relationship is different  but regardless of your unique situation  you should spend some time apart immediately after the breakup. continuing to hang out on a daily basis will make it much more difficult for both of you to move on.   consider telling him that you still want to be friends  but only if you mean it. if you do  then respect the fact that it might take him some time to feel comfortable spending time with you again. don t force him to be your friend immediately.  
query	83	evaluate respiratory system prevent respiratory problems in guinea pigs  a well ventilated cage allows fresh air to enter and circulate through the cage. also  a cage with good ventilation prevents the buildup of ammonia  which can irritate a guinea pig s respiratory tract. wire cages provide great ventilation. glass cages  however  do not.  proper cage placement is another prevention strategy. put the cage in an area where your guinea pigs will not feel a constant draft of air.for example  place the cage away from ceiling and floor vents.   a constant draft of air could bother your guinea pigs  respiratory tracts. within the draft free area  make sure the cage is not in the direct path of sunlight.this could warm up the cage too much.    dust can lead to respiratory problems in guinea pigs. yesterday s news cat litter and carefresh  are great low dust bedding choices for guinea pig cages.if you are not sure if the current bedding is dusty  take some of it in your hand  go outside  and toss it up in the air. if you see lots of dust in the air as the bedding falls to the ground  switch to a low dust bedding.sawdust shavings contain a lot of dust. some beddings  such as cedar shavings and pine shavings  contain aromatic  scented  oils that can cause respiratory tract irritation.change the bedding whenever it becomes wet or dirty.    a clean cage is very important for preventing respiratory problems. first  place your guinea pigs in a guinea proof room  no hiding spaces or visible electrical cords  or small travel carrier.next  remove all bedding and accessories from the cage. clean the cage with warm  soapy water and a sponge. let the cage dry completely before putting fresh bedding  cage accessories  and your guinea pigs back in.consider these other helpful cleaning tips make a schedule so you don t forget to clean the cage. wash the food bowl and water bottle with unscented soap. your guinea pigs may not like the smell of scented soap. instead of soapy water  spray a 50 50 mixture of white vinegar and water to clean the cage. clean the cage at least once a week.    because guinea pigs are social animals  it is a good idea to house 2 or more guinea pigs together.however  if the cage is too small  the guinea pigs would be overcrowded and stressed. the stress would weaken the immune system and make respiratory problems more likely.to prevent overcrowding  choose a cage large enough for the number of guinea pigs you have 2 guinea pigs  30 x 50 inches  76 x 127 cm  3 guinea pigs  30 x 62 inches  76 x 157 cm  4 guinea pigs  30 x 76 inches  76 x 193 cm     sometimes  guinea pig cage mates do not get along. they may fight or bully each other. this aggression could increase stress levels.if you notice your guinea pigs are not getting along  place them in separate cages.    rabbits carry a bacteria called bordetella in their respiratory tracts that they can transmit to guinea pigs. a guinea pig with bordetella can develop serious respiratory problems. also  a rabbit can bully a guinea pig  increasing the guinea pig s stress and weakening its immune system.keep your rabbits and guinea pigs in separate cages.   a rabbit with bordetella usually doesn t show signs of respiratory illness. a guinea pig with bordetella  however  can show many symptoms  including difficulty breathing  discharge from the eyes and nose  loss of appetite  and maybe even sudden death.  respiratory infections are very contagious in guinea pigs. if one of your guinea pigs has a respiratory infection  keep it in a separate cage until it fully recovers.this will prevent your healthy guinea pigs from getting sick.    if you have purchased a new guinea pig  keep it separate from your other guinea pigs for 2 weeks. put the new guinea pig in its own cage and do not let it interact with the other guinea pigs. during this 2 weeks  make sure the new guinea is eating and drinking normally and looks healthy.if the new guinea is showing any signs of respiratory problems  e.g.  sneezing  discharge from the eyes and nose   take it to your vet for treatment.   to prevent the spread of illness between the new and current guinea pigs  wash your hands between handling each one.after the quarantine  introduce the guinea pigs gradually. first  put their cages next to each other so they can smell each other. then  introduce them face to face.select a neutral area  such as a large play area  to make the face to face introductions. a gradual introduction can prevent respiratory problems by reducing the stress of introducing a new guinea pig to the home.  vitamin c is an important nutrient for guinea pigs. guinea pigs cannot produce vitamin c in their bodies  so they must obtain it through their diet. feed your guinea pigs vitamin c rich foods like oranges  broccoli  and leafy greens  e.g.  kale  parsley  spinach . you can also feed them vitamin c fortified pellets.vitamin c in pellets can break down quickly. check the milling date  processing date  on the package. feed the pellets within 90 days of the milling date to ensure your guinea pigs get enough vitamin c from the pellets.you could put vitamin c drops in your guinea pigs  water bottle. however  vitamin c breaks down very quickly in water. plus  the drops could make the water taste bad.a guinea pig needs at least 50 milligrams of vitamin c each day to stay healthy.without enough vitamin c  a guinea pig s immune system could weaken.  your good hygiene can prevent respiratory problems in guinea pigs. if you have multiple guinea pigs  wash your hands between handling each one.this is especially important if one of your guinea pigs is sick.    dental problems can lead to respiratory problems in guinea pigs. for example  the tooth roots  located above the gum line  of a guinea pig s cheek teeth are fairly close to the nasal airways.if these roots get pushed upward because of another dental problem  a guinea pig could develop respiratory problems  like a sinus infection.   dental problems require veterinary treatment  such as surgery and antibiotics.

query	85	cause shock spot obstructive shock symptoms  signs and symptoms of obstructive shock begin to show when the heart fails to pump enough blood to the rest of the body.some of the first signs that are noticeable involve the skin  such as excessive sweating  clamminess  reduced temperature and a general paleness.   if the skin looks pale and feels clammy  touch the fingers and toes to see if they re chilly. that s a good indication that there s a circulation problem. a lack of oxygen to tissues can make the skin look pale  but also with a bluish tint   a condition called cyanosis.    another set of signs and symptoms common with obstructive shock are related to brain function and consciousness. reduced blood and oxygen to the brain quickly leads to lightheadedness  confusion  problems concentrating  anxiety  restlessness and loss of consciousness  ultimately .any problem involving a blockage of blood  heart attack  stroke  pulmonary embolism  severe atherosclerosis  will cause similar behaviors and impairments. if you sense any of these symptoms in someone else  carry on a short conversation with them   they won t make any sense if they are experiencing obstructive shock.    as the heart or surrounding major blood vessels  aorta  vena cava  are unable to pump enough blood to the body  the pulse and pressure in the cardiovascular system drops.low blood pressure  hypotension  contributes to lightheadedness and dizziness  especially when trying to stand up from a seated or horizontal position.   although blood pressure varies from person to person  a reading of 90   60 mmhg or less is generally considered hypotension.the best places to feel for a pulse are the inside wrist  inside part of the ankle and the neck close to the jaw line. a strong pulse is obvious  a weak pulse is barely detectable.    due to a weak heartbeat and pulse  the body increases the breathing rate in attempts to get enough oxygen into the blood so the cells  tissues and organs don t start to die.however  the breathing isn t deep like it would be if the person was simply winded   instead it s shallow and rapid. this kind of breathing quickly leads to a dry mouth and thirst.   look at the chest  or lightly touch it  to see if it s rising and falling quickly  which indicates rapid and shallow breathing. hold your ear close to the person s mouth to better detect if their breathing is rapid and shallow. a normal respiration rate for a calm adult is between 12 to 20 breaths per minute   above 25 is considered abnormal.  chest pain is a typical symptom related to problems in the heart or lungs  which are the most common locations for obstructions leading to shock.cardiovascular chest pain can sort of mimic heartburn or indigestion  but usually it s more severe and involves a feeling of fear or impending doom. chest pain from a heart obstruction often involves referral pain to the left shoulder blade and down the left arm also.   chest pain from a heart obstruction tends to be felt a little more on the left side of the upper chest  whereas as lung  pulmonary  obstruction is often felt more centrally or slightly to the right. an obstruction in the lower aorta or vena cava often triggers pain lower in the stomach   intestinal area.    although a person s pulse rate is weak  difficult to feel  with obstructive shock  their heart rate  number of beats per minute  is actually increased or elevated because their body is trying to overcome the shortage of blood around the body.in essence  the heart beats faster  but not enough blood gets to peripheral arteries in the limbs to be easily detected.   a normal pulse rate for a healthy resting adult ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute.levels above this indicate a problem with the heart. put your hand on the person s heart or close to it  such as the base of the neck  to see if it seems to be working harder than normal. it s also not uncommon for an overworked heart to flutter or  skip a beat  with an obstruction.    another symptom of obstructive shock  and one that represents advanced organ failure  is little or no production of urine.as such  urinating is either very difficult or impossible because the kidneys no longer work well enough to filter water out of the blood  produce urine and send it to the bladder.    obstructive shock occurs when there s a physical obstruction that prevents the heart from filling. however  you will probably not be able to determine the cause of the shock. this will be evaluated by medical personal at the hospital using diagnostic tests. common causes of obstructive shock may include heart malformations or lesions tension pneumothorax cardiac tamponade pulmonary thromboembolism aortic dissection vena cava syndrome    obstructive shock requires immediate medical attention because it s life threatening.as such  if you notice any of the above mentioned symptoms with yourself or with friends   family  call 9 1 1 for assistance immediately or transport the person to the emergency department of a hospital. don t drive yourself if you feel any symptoms.   call as soon as any of the signs and symptoms begin to develop   don t wait for them to get better or go away. stay with the person until medical assistance arrives and practice basic cpr while waiting.    while waiting for medical professionals to arrive  make sure the person is conscious and still able to breathe. as long as they are still conscious and their heart is still functioning  check the person s rate of breathing every 5 minutes or so to see if it becomes more rapid.the more rapid and shallow the breathing  the more likely the person is about to have a heart attack and or go unconscious. put your hand on their chest and keep your ear close to their mouth to monitor breathing and heart rate.    if the breathing becomes more labored and shallow  lay the person down so they don t injure themselves if they lose consciousness. help them into the shock position  assuming there s no injury to the head  neck  spine or legs   by laying them down flatly with their feet elevated by about 12 inches  which will help improve circulation.loosen any tight clothing  especially around the neck.   do not elevate their head because it makes it harder for the blood to get to their brain and may make symptoms worse. if there s any vomiting or drooling  turn their head to the side to prevent them from choking. cover the person with a blanket or jacket to keep them warm  as shock causes the person to become hypothermic.    if the person loses their pulse and stops breathing altogether  initiate rescue breathing  mouth to mouth  and other cpr techniques if you are properly trained.if you re not  then it s probably a better idea to just wait with the person until medical help arrives. stay on the phone with 9 1 1 and they will advise you what to do. although keep in mind that initial brain damage can occur in as little as five minutes once a person stops breathing and their heart stops beating.thrusting over the person s heart helps circulate the blood somewhat  and in rare situations  it can  kick start  the heart into beating again. alternate chest thrusting with blowing air into the person s mouth. make sure to elevate their chin  to open the airways  and pinch their nose so the air is forced down into the lungs. give two breaths  then 30 chest compression and then alternate between the two for as long as you can until help arrives.compression only cpr is preferred for less trained rescuers.
query	86	care skin choose a skin care line  knowing your skin type is essential to finding the right products to care for it. the basic types are normal  oily  dry  and combination. your type is determined by the size of your pores  the degree of oil and moisture in your skin  and its sensitivity to environmental irritants.you have normal skin if you have few imperfections  no significant sensitivities  and small pores that are barely visible. oily skin generally comes from large pores. it leads to dull or shiny skin that is prone to blackheads  acne  and other blemishes that arise from clogged pores. you have dry skin if your skin is rough  scaly  or dull. it also may be spotted with red or itchy patches. your pores will be so small as to be practically invisible. combination skin that combines areas of oily  normal  and or dry skin is common. for instance  many people have larger pores that produce more oil on their foreheads  noses  and chins.    besides knowing your skin type  you should also note if you have any significant sensitivities to environmental irritants. if your skin sometimes itches  stings  burns  and or breaks out in a rash when you use beauty or hygienic products  then you have sensitive skin.if you do  you should go for beauty products that are for sensitive skin  hypoallergenic  and free from dyes and fragrances.    besides catering to a particular skin type  many skin care lines are aimed at improving specific  treatable conditions that affect your skin. ask yourself what problems you are trying to correct or prevent so that you can pick products to address them.for instance  do you want to get rid of acne  acne scars  rosacea  dark spots or pigmentation  are there wrinkles or other signs of aging that you d like to address  would you like to minimize large pores or treat blackheads  is the skin under your eyes puffy or discolored     is your skin fair  light  medium  or dark  while this won t make a difference for many products  it s useful to keep in mind when you re buying products that are tinted to match your skin  such as tinted moisturizers . it s also helpful to think about when considering the degree of sun protection that you d like your skin care products to provide.if you have fair skin  it s likely that you burn easily and should go for a skin care line that offers a high spf of 30 . if you re light or medium in complexion  pick products that offer some protection in the 15 30 spf range. if you have darker skin and only rarely burn  you can choose a line with minimal to no sun protection.    make sure that you keep notes about your skin assessments for your reference. many skin care products are made to address specific skin care needs and issues. you want to have your skin type  condition  and tone on hand as you select beauty products to help you make the best choices.   for example  your skin may be dry but also sensitive  so you need products designed for both dry and sensitive skin  as opposed to something heavy that may be hydrating but also irritating. perhaps your skin is combination and patchy in its coloring. you may want products that balance the skin s moisture and tone.    besides knowing your skin needs  it s important to know your budget when it comes to skin care. prices for skin care products can vary greatly  ranging anywhere from a few dollars to a few hundred or more. figuring out your minimum and maximum expenditure is very useful for limiting your skin care options.for example  facial moisturizers alone can run you anywhere from less than  10  like purpose dual treatment moisture lotion  to around  50  like lancome bienfait multi vital sunscreen cream  to more than  100  such as tracie martyn re sculpting cream .as a general rule  product lines carried at salons  boutiques  high end department stores  and spas tend to cost more than those on the shelves of your local pharmacy or discount retailer.    organic products must use all natural materials that have not been genetically modified  synthetically produced  or grown with pesticides or chemical fertilizers. while there is no evidence that they are more effective than other types of skin care products  some people prefer organic lines because of their lack of potentially toxic chemical ingredients and ethical  environmentally sound production standards.the use of the word  organic  on product labels is highly regulated by the usda  so you can be confident that the product that advertises itself as such meets a strict code. however  words like  natural    non toxic   or  hypoallergenic  are not regulated. since they have no set legal definition  it s important to treat them as marketing terms rather than specific factual claims.    when you re looking for a skin care line  you should pick those products that have active ingredients that have been clinically proven to be effective. be sure to check the labels to ensure that the lines you are considering have at least 5 15  concentrations of safe and effective active ingredients.the most important active ingredients are vitamins a  b  c  and e  but they will most likely take on different names on product labels. for vitamin a  which helps with moisturizing  acne  rosacea  and dermatitis  look for retinoic acid  retinol  or retinyl propionate. for vitamins b   b5  which moisturize while addressing acne  itchiness  eczema  and sunburn  look for niacin  nicotinamide  pantothenic acid  or panthenol. for vitamin c  which enhances skin texture while decreasing wrinkles and sun damage  look for l ascorbic acid. for vitamin e  which moisturizes and helps prevent wrinkles  look for di alpha tocopherol. do not use products that include tocopherol acetate  since this form of vitamin e is especially susceptible to degradation from sunlight and can therefore actually cause damage to your skin.    the most basic  line  will pair a cleanser with a moisturizer. if you re looking for a more complete regime that can address more specific issues  you can consider adding on toners  exfoliators  serums  and or specific treatments  for instance  for nights  wrinkles  under eye puffing and discoloration  or acne .the amount of product you get should correspond with both your skin care needs and lifestyle. more comprehensive lines will be more costly to purchase and time consuming to administer.    now that you ve done your homework  it s time to start finding the right products to match your needs and preferences. the best way to do so is to take all of your requirements with you to a pharmacy  beauty shop  department store  salons  or skin care center where you can consult with an esthetician. tell them your needs and preferences  and ask for their advice about which skin care lines would offer the best fit for you.for instance  when you approach an esthetician for advice  you could say something like   hi  i m looking for an inexpensive line of skin care products. i ve got dry  sensitive skin that s very fair. i m looking for products that can address wrinkles and other signs of aging while providing sun protection. do you have any recommendations and samples i could try   or   hello  can you help me  i ve got dark  combination skin that s prone to acne. could you suggest some appropriate skin care products that are under  100   avoid salespeople who represent a particular line. you want advice from someone who is unbiased and knowledgeable about multiple brands. ask for multiple options with a range of price points that fit in your budget. keep your budget in mind when picking where to go for recommendations. over the counter lines at pharmacies and beauty shops will be less expensive than those offered exclusively by salons or skin care centers. however  the latter will be more likely to have qualified experts to guide you. many skin care centers will offer free consultations if you make an appointment in advance.    one of the nice things about consulting with an esthetician in person is that they will likely be able to give you samples of the skin care options that they recommend to you. while you won t be able to judge the long term effects of particular products  there s nothing like being able to test first hand if you like the general look and feel of a product as well as if the skin care routine associated with the line works for you.if you re sampling more than one line  keep notes about your impressions of each as you test them. list any pros and or cons about how the products make your skin look and feel to help you make your final decision. for example  when you re evaluating a cleanser  you may write something like   pros  nice fragrance  good lather  rinses off cleanly. cons  dries out skin.  if you re taking notes on a moisturizer  you might write   pros  pleasant feel and texture  all day hydration  sun protection. cons  makes skin shiny around t zone.     samples will give you a preliminary first hand impression  but if you want to hear more about customers  long term satisfaction with the line  seek out reviews.most online stores that sell multiple skin care lines  such as amazon or sephora  will enable customer reviews to lend credibility to the products on offer. search for a particular product to see how it rates  and read the written reviews to see the volume of reviewers and hear why they gave the ratings they did. there are also some product reviews available from skin care experts. do an online search for your product s name    review  to see if it has been evaluated by an unbiased expert. only consider those reviews that include the author s skin care credentials and indicate that they have no financial ties to the brand being reviewed.    see if the product packaging lists any potential side effects that you should be aware of. besides looking at customer reviews  research the safety of your line through databases that conduct independent testing of skin care products.some skin care products may alleviate a specific problem quickly but may not be best for long term use. see if this is the case for your line before you commit to it. try consumerlab.com  an independent review site that tests health and nutritional products  for reports on your skin care line. search for a particular product and or active ingredient in it to ensure that your line is safe for consumer use.    once you ve found a skin care line that checks out in terms of the samples and reviews  go ahead a purchase its core products. be sure that you re satisfied with the basic components of a line before investing in the whole shebang. if the cleanser  toner  and moisturizer are working well for your skin  start adding on the extras to address your specific needs  such as exfoliants  masks  serums  and treatments.

hard work  but all the dedication does pay off. you will feel so proud once you have made significant improvement and you listen back on one of your very first sessions.    speaking slowly may be frowned upon by some people  but slow and careful speaking is a very effective way to express yourself when you have a speech disorder.you don t have to speak very slowly  merely speak in a pace that s comfortable for you and your listeners. a steady pace is better than speaking in a fast pace  especially if you want to send the intended meaning of your message across.    speech delivery depends on physical body mechanics just as it counts on verbals factors like inflection. if you keep your back bent and hunch your shoulders  you don t allow enough air to exert pressure on your diaphragm or pass through your larynx  voice box . the best public speakers and orators often maintain proper speaking posture  which includes stomach in chest out shoulders relaxed back straight feet steady    the proper standing and sitting posture means that you draw your voice not directly from the larynx  but from the diaphragm. you also relieve pressure on your larynx by relaxing your shoulders  which means that you would talk in your natural pitch. if you keep your feet flat and steady  you also give yourself a very stable vertical base to support your body when you talk.  sometimes  impediments in speech  like stuttering  grow from nerves and anxiety.before you have to speak in front of a group  go through a deep breathing activity to calm your nerves  relax your body  and get you in the right mental state for proper speech.   sit comfortably and with an erect posture. breathe in deeply through your nose. you should use your hand to feel your stomach expanding like a balloon being inflated. hold the breath and then release it slowly  feeling your stomach deflating beneath your hand. repeat this exercise before you have to speak publicly to relieve stress.    another great advantage to proper posture is that you look and feel good whenever you re speaking  whether it s a formal speaking engagement or a chat over lunch. proper posture boosts your confidence  and tells people that you know what you re talking about.    this professional will diagnose your specific speech disorder and discover the causes. then  they will decide which interventions will be most helpful in enabling you to speak correctly. the therapist will determine how much speech therapy you need  and you should regularly attend therapy for the best results. therapists are capable of improving speech impediments in both children and adults.speech therapy is helpful for correcting your impediment. the therapist will point out the part of speech where you re having problems  and will work with you to correct it. private speech therapy sessions do not come cheap  although most insurance policies will fund services needed to treat speech disorders. there s no substitute for learning and practice when it comes to the proper and effective use of language. take every opportunity to speak  to practice and brush up on the correct pronunciation and enunciation provided to you by a professional.    these practitioners can help you overcome your speech impediments if they are caused by emotional distress or learning disabilities. counseling provided by the professional is very useful if you need to break out of your silence and to talk about your problems  your frustrations  or your own personal tragedy. such interventions might help you come to terms with anxiety and learn effective ways of coping that still enable you to speak properly.  if you have misaligned teeth  you may have difficulty pronouncing some words because of a lisp. most malocclusions are corrected through braces. braces pull  push  and adjust individual teeth to correct your bite. the problem with braces is that they often cause a speech impediment  especially when the springs  bands and wires of a set of braces are adjusted every month.every time the dentist adjusts your braces  or even dentures   you need to train yourself to talk and to eat properly. it may be quite painful at first  but remember not to go too far  lest you end up with a mouth injury. most braces are used for orthodontic purposes  although some braces can be used as decorations. braces are rather expensive  and you may need to take out a dental plan or cash in on dental insurance to pay for them. kids and teenagers don t like to wear braces because they re often teased as  metal mouths  or  railroad faces.  the fact is that braces are still the best way to correct a lisp caused by misaligned teeth.    features that present at birth or due to physical injuries may result in medical conditions that limit your ability to speak. many of these physical conditions can be rectified with proper speech and medical treatment.   cleft lips and palates were a major cause of speech impediments until surgery became affordable. now  children born with clefts can have reconstructive surgery and a multidisciplinary team of providers that help with feeding and speech and language development.malocclusion is when the teeth do not have the proper normal bite. malocclusions are usually corrected through braces  although orthodontic surgery is necessary in some cases. individuals with this condition may talk with a lisp  make a whistle sound when certain words are spoken  or mumble.neurological disorders caused by accidents or brain and nerve tumors can cause a speech disorder called dysprosody. dysprosody involves difficulty in expressing the tonal and emotional qualities of speech such as inflection and emphasis.  dyslexia and other learning disabilities can prevent a person from learning how to speak properly. children who suffer from learning disabilities often have speech impediments  although they can be overcome through speech therapy.  people who suffer from traumatic experiences often develop speech problems like stammering and stuttering. a death in the family  a horrible accident  or a crime can often affect the ability of a person to speak clearly.  some speech impediments are permanent  especially when caused by neurological disorders. on the other hand  a speech impediment may be the result of not having been taught how to speak clearly and communicate effectively. if you or your child are not taught proper speech practices at school or at home as a youth  it could lead to a speech impediment. these conditions  however  can generally be overcome.    on the other hand  many people with speech impediments encounter these problems because it runs in their families. in fact  research shows that inherited speech and language impairments are more likely to occur the more individuals in the family are affected. in other words  if both parents and one sibling have a speech disorder  the other sibling has a higher chance of having one as well.
query	88	reduce spinal muscular atrophy build up atrophied muscles  muscle atrophy is the medical term used to denote the condition when a part of the body suffers muscle loss or when muscle tissue wastes away.it s normal for muscle atrophy to occur as we age  but it can also be a sign of a more serious medical condition  illness  or injury. muscle atrophy can negatively impact a person s quality of life because they lose strength and mobility  which can make it difficult to perform basic tasks. people with atrophied muscles are also at an increased risk for falling or injuring themselves. since the heart is also a muscle that can break down  individuals experiencing muscle atrophy face the risk of heart problems.    muscles can atrophy from disuse  or when they are not used regularly at an appreciable level of exertion. this disuse causes the muscle tissue to break down  shorten in length  and waste away. this typically occurs as a result of an injury  sedentary lifestyle  or medical condition that prevents a person from exercising his muscles.disuse muscle atrophy can also result from severe malnourishment. for example  prisoners of war and people suffering from eating disorders such as anorexia may experience muscle loss and the wasting away of muscle tissue. people with jobs that require them to be seated for major portions of each work day or people who are not physically active can also experience this type of muscle atrophy. severe injuries such as those to the spinal cord or brain may leave someone bedridden and result in atrophied muscles. even common injuries such as broken bones or sprains that restrict your ability to move around can also cause disuse muscle atrophy. medical conditions that limit a person s ability to exercise or be physically active include rheumatoid arthritis  which causes joint inflammation  and osteoarthritis  which weakens the bones. these conditions can make it uncomfortable  painful  or even impossible to exercise  leading to atrophied muscles. in many cases of disuse muscle atrophy  the loss of muscle tissue can be reversed by increasing physical exercise.    neurogenic muscle atrophy is caused by a disease or injury to the nerves attached to the muscles. it is less common than disuse muscle atrophy  but harder to treat because nerve regeneration usually requires more than increased exercise. some of the diseases that often lead to neurogenic atrophy include     polio  a viral disease that can cause paralysis. muscular dystrophy  a hereditary disease that weakens the muscles.  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  which is also known as als or lou gehrig s disease  attacks the nerve cells that communicate with and control muscles.guillain barre syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that causes your body s immune system to attack your nerves  resulting in muscle paralysis and weakness.multiple sclerosis  or ms  is another autoimmune disease that can immobilize the whole body.  it s important to recognize the symptoms of muscle atrophy early so you can begin treating your condition. some of the main symptoms include muscle weakness and decrease in muscle size. skin around the affected muscle may seem to sag away from the muscle. difficulty lifting things  moving the atrophied area  or doing exercise that was once easy. pain in the affected area. back pain and difficulty walking. a feeling of stiffness or heaviness in the affected area. the symptoms of neurogenic muscle atrophy can be harder for someone without a medical background to recognize  but some of the more visible symptoms include a stooped posture  a rigid spine  and a limited ability to move the neck.    if you suspect that you are experiencing muscle atrophy  it s a good idea to talk with your doctor or a medical professional as soon as possible. they will be able to properly diagnose your condition and provide treatment for the underlying causes.if the reason for muscle deterioration is an illness  your doctor may be able to prescribe medications that will help you maintain your muscle mass or reverse some damage of muscle atrophy. anti inflammatory medicines such as corticosteroids are sometimes given to patients with muscle atrophy  which helps to reduce inflammation and compression of the affected muscle nerves. this can make exercise and daily activities more comfortable. to diagnose muscle atrophy  doctors often use blood tests  x rays  ct scans  emg scans  mri scans  and muscle or nerve biopsies. they may also measure muscle tone and reflexes.a doctor will also be able to talk with you about whether any kinds of exercise can stop the loss of muscle tissues or if you need to undergo surgeries and other kinds of treatments.    depending on what is causing the muscle atrophy  your doctor might recommend you work with a physical therapist  nutritionist  or a personal trainer who can improve your condition with targeted exercise  diet  and lifestyle changes.    even if the doctor did not find that your muscle atrophy is caused by a specific disease  it s a good idea to talk with your doctor or health provider before attempting to build up atrophied muscles. you don t want to overdo anything or endanger your health  and your doctor may be able to refer you to a qualified trainer or physical therapist.  though you can do some physical activities on your own to reverse muscle atrophy s effects  it is always best to have a qualified instructor or trainer to ensure that you are on the right track.   she will start out by assessing your capabilities and guide you through specific exercises to build muscle in the atrophied areas. she can also gauge your progress and adjust the exercise routine as needed.    since many people with atrophied muscles are beginning exercise again after a long break from physical activity  it s important to start slowly. remember  your body is not as strong as it was prior to atrophy.    swimming and water exercises are often recommended for patients who are trying to recover from muscle atrophy because this form of exercise can dull muscle pain  quickly tone atrophied muscles  rebuild muscle memory  and relax sore muscles. while it s best to work with an expert  here are a few basic steps to get you started   with water at hip  to waist height  try walking around the pool for 10 minutes. this workout is low risk and helps develop the muscles in the lower part of your body.   as you progress  increase the time interval and the depth of the water. you can also use paddles or water barbells for more resistance. these tools will help work your core and upper body.    try a knee lift by positioning your back against the pool wall  and placing both feet flat on the bottom of the pool. then  lift a knee up as if you are marching in place. when your knee is at hip height  extend it outward.   keep doing this for ten repetitions  before switching to the other leg. as you progress  try doing additional sets for each leg.    face the pool wall with your arms resting on the deck of the pool and shoulder width apart. use your hands to raise your body up out of the water so you are about halfway out of the pool. hold the position for a few seconds and then slowly lower yourself back in the pool.   for an easier version  place your hands on the pool deck so they are shoulder width apart. as you bend your elbows  lean your chest toward the wall of the pool.    if you feel proficient doing exercises in the water  add some body weight exercises while on dry land.   a beginner can start with eight to twelve repetitions of the exercise moves mentioned below. these exercises target the major muscle groups. perform this routine three times per week to build up atrophied muscles.    to perform a squat  stand straight and put both hands forward. slowly and carefully bend your knees  as if sitting in an imaginary chair. hold this position for a few seconds before going back to the starting position.keep your weight on your heels and do not allow your knees to go past your toes.    to perform lunges  stand up straight with your hands on your hips. pull your abdominal muscles in.take a large step forward with your right foot. keep your back straight while moving forward. your heel should be raised while the tip of the toe is pressing against the floor. bend both knees at the same time until they both form a 90 degree angle. you can check your position at the mirror to know if you are doing it right. put your heel down and push upwards to stand. return to the starting position and do all of the above with the left leg. remember that your body should not be slouching forward.    to do a triceps dip  prepare a strong bench or a secured chair. sit on the bench or chair and place your hands shoulder width apart along the edge.slowly slide your butt off the seat with your legs extended in front of you. straighten your arms to keep tension on the triceps. bend your elbows carefully while keeping your back close to the bench. upon completing this part  press down on the bench to straighten your arms.    for a basic ab crunch  lie on your back on a mat or a carpeted surface. bend your knees and make sure that your feet are flat on the floor.you can cross your arms in front of your chest or place your hands behind your neck or head. try to pull your shoulders towards the ceiling by making use of the force from your abdominal muscles. hold the  crunched  position for a few seconds  then lie back down and repeat.    make use of resistance tools such as resistance bands or weight machines to help you with your form. you should only move on to these exercises once you can successfully perform the body weight exercises indicated above. it s also a good idea to research specific resistance exercises that target the affected area.bench presses can be done with resistance bands. lay down on a bench and push forward while gripping the bands like you are lifting barbells. start with lighter weight bands. if you feel comfortable with the current weight  fold it lengthwise to increase the resistance. once you feel comfortable  you can move on to heavier weight bands.    in addition to the other exercises described in this article  cardio exercise is a good way to build up atrophied muscles. try establishing a regular walking or cardio routine.start with ten to fifteen minutes of continuous walking per day. gradually increase your speed and try to take a 30 minute walk or jog daily.    after each workout  stretch your muscles to increase their range of motion. do five to ten minutes of stretching after each workout. you can also perform a separate stretching session.make sure to perform stretches that target all of the major muscles  and hold each stretch for 15 to 30 seconds. begin with stretching your back and your upper body. next move on to stretches for your neck  forearms  wrists and triceps. do not forget your chest  buttocks and groin area before moving to your thighs. lastly  perform stretches for instep and hamstrings.    here are some specific stretching exercises for different parts of the body neck stretching  incline your head forward then stretch your neck to the left  right  back and forward. do not roll your head from side to side as this practice is dangerous. shoulder stretching  place your left arm on your chest. grab the forearm with the opposite arm. pull it until you feel that your shoulder is being stretched. push the arm you are stretching in the opposite direction to contract the muscles. do the same steps for the right arm. triceps stretching  start with raising your right arm. bend the right elbow and reach down behind your head and between the shoulder blades. make use of the left arm to reach and grab the right elbow. lastly  pull your elbow toward your head. wrist stretching  simply hold your arm out and slightly pull back your hand with the opposite hand. do this repetitively. hamstrings stretching  start in a cross legged sitting position. put one leg out. attempt to reach and hold the foot for a few seconds. go back to the starting position and do the same thing with the other leg. lower back stretch  lie down on your back. bring one leg up to chest level. do the same with the other leg. leg stretching  lie down on your back and extend both legs in the air. grab the back of your thighs and pull the legs toward your face.    a constant supply of protein is necessary for muscle growth. see the basic guidelines below for daily recommended protein intake based on your age and gender.adult men should eat about 56 grams of protein per day. adult women should eat about 46 grams per day. women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should eat at least 71 grams of protein per day. teenaged boys should eat about 52 grams a day. teenaged girls should eat about 46 grams per day. foods rich in protein include turkey breast  fish  cheese  pork loin  tofu  lean beef  beans  eggs  yogurt  dairy products  and nuts. a nutritionist  personal trainer  or dietician might suggest something other than the recommended dose based on your condition  weight  and activity level.    if you don t eat sufficient carbohydrates to fuel your body  it will start breaking down muscles instead. this can further aggravate the muscle atrophy in the affected area.to build atrophied muscle  your carbohydrate intake should be at least 45 to 65 percent of your total calorie intake.try to select carbohydrates that are also full of fiber and do not have a lot of added sugars. these include fruits and vegetables  whole grains  plain yogurt  and milk.    these good fats stop the breakdown of muscle by interfering with the inflammatory process.foods rich in omega 3 fatty acids include sardines  salmon  soybeans  flax seeds  walnuts  tofu  brussels sprouts  cauliflower  shrimp  and winter squash. the recommended dose for omega 3 fatty acids is 1 to 2 grams daily  when the body experiences stress  it prepares to respond. this preparation is known as the fight or flight response. in this response  many hormone levels shoot up including the stress hormone known as cortisol  which can break down muscle tissue during periods of prolonged stress.since stress cannot be completely eliminated in our lives  take steps to minimize. identifying the source of your stress can help you prevent it from occurring. you can also try stress control techniques such as meditation or yoga. for specific suggestions  talk with a therapist  counselor  or mental health professional about the stressors in your life.    when we sleep  our body builds and repairs muscles  so this is an important step to combat muscle atrophy.try to get seven to nine hours of sleep per day.  
query	89	increase testosterone increase testosterone levels naturally  ask for a detailed analysis of your weight. if you are overweight or obese  this could be the cause of a drop in testosterone.   obese people secrete more aromatase  an enzyme that works to convert testosterone to estrogen. your metabolism will continue to decrease as your body produces more aromatase  making the problem worse. create a weight loss plan with your doctor.    increased weight and obesity can lead to low testosterone levels.changing your dietary patterns can make a big difference not only to your testosterone levels but to your risk for heart disease and diabetes. start changing your diet by cutting out processed  packaged  and prepared foods.    eating  whole  foods means cutting out excess sugars  trans and hydrogenated fats  preservatives  etc. try to incorporate    more fruits and vegetablesmore fish and quality meat. avoid processed food  including grains  lentils  beans  and dairy. more nuts and seeds    this includes sugars added to processed foods  such as high fructose corn syrup   as well as artificial sweeteners.if you need a  sweet hit   try using stevia  a herb that can provide sixty times the sweetness of sugar.    omega 3 fats are healthy fats found in a variety of foods. these include those found in eggs  algae  fish  and mussels  but also plant oils like flaxseed  hemp and walnut oil. healthy fats actually help to build a healthier body.    lots of water is essential to any healthy diet. in addition to hydrating you  water can also stop you from feeling hungry.    cut down on snacking  eating when bored  and other sneaky calories. try to eat only when you are hungry.    restricting calories significantly may send the wrong signals to your body  which will not increase testosterone. instead  cut your calories by approximately 15 percent the first week.   all weight loss goals should be reasonable. aim to lose a pound per week by improving diet and increasing activity levels.    meat  high protein yogurt  and some vegetables can help build muscle. increasing muscle will help burn fat and increase testosterone.    if you have never lifted weights  used resistance bands or used weight machines  hire a personal trainer or physical therapist to teach you the proper form and procedure.if you are very weak  start with resistance bands. this gentle form of strength training allows you to use a rubber strap to train weak muscles before lifting actual weights.do this 2 to 3 times per week for the first 3 to 4 weeks. if you have a joint or back problem  you may want to graduate to stronger bands and stick to this form of strength training. you can increase your testosterone levels by up to 20 percent by lifting weights 3 times per week for 11 weeks. strength training in the evenings can increase testosterone levels in the evening. these effects tend to be brief and smaller the better shape you are in.they can still help.    for men  you will want to choose weights that tire your muscles after only 5 repetitions. do 3 sets. you should feel muscle fatigue after a weight training workout. allow your muscles 24 to 48 hours to rest.   women or people with joint problems may choose to do endurance training. for example  they may choose a slightly lower weight and complete 3 sets of 10 to 15. work half sets in between full sets. this means you should complete half the range of motion  from the bottom up or top down  to work the fast twitch muscle fibers as well as the slow twitch fibers. lift weights slowly. breathe slowly and never drop the weight. control the weight until it is in its original position.    begin doing cardio exercise for at least 30 minutes 5 times per week.   interval training requires you to warm up  sprint or workout intensely for a short period  such as 90 seconds   and then work out at a more moderate  resting  pace for a slightly longer interval  approximately 2 to 4 minutes . repeat these sets for approximately 30 minutes  including warm up and cool down. the different intervals can vary based on the specific cardio activity. if you are new to interval training  consider having a personal trainer suggest a regimen for your experience level. cardiovascular machines  like stair machines  bikes  ellipticals  and treadmills can be programmed to do interval training if you do not want to jog or swim while providing your own interval timing.    while general activity is good  you will need to work your heart more intensely to reach weight loss and testosterone improvement goals. this is true for both strength training and cardio.   do not overtrain. if you are already fit  too much cardio exercise is likely to lower testosterone levels.your goal is to keep your metabolism high while giving the body plenty of time to rest and recover. drink plenty of water before  during  and after exercise. dehydrated people produce less testosterone after a workout. don t forget the other benefits from exercise  including better cardiovascular health  weight loss  increased strength  and endurance.  intermittent fasting combined with moderate to high intensity exercise has been shown to increase testosterone levels.during the fasting period  include moderate to high intensity exercise of your choice. the idea here is that since you are fasting  your body will turn to stored fat for its fuel.  doctors recommend 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night. less sleep can result in 10  lower testosterone levels. less sleep can also make it difficult to lose weight.  moving around more and sitting less will balance your hormones  decrease stress  and result in weight loss.   buy a pedometer. make sure you hit at least 10 000 steps per day during the course of your daily routine.    stress produces the hormone cortisol and interrupts the production of hormones such as testosterone.focus on creating a work life balance. spend 2 hours a day on leisure activities you enjoy. try to bring your workday down to 10 hours or less.start meditation  deep breathing  yoga  tai chi  and or qigong. these activities can reduce stress and help you sleep better. if you don t think you have time  start by taking four 2 3 minutes throughout the day to take 25 deep breaths per break.    if low testosterone has affected your sex life  then consider changing sexual activity to the morning. testosterone levels are naturally higher in the morning.    getting vitamin d requires you to spend some time  15 to 30 minutes  with a good amount of your skin in direct sunlight. keeping vitamin d levels high can produce up to 20  more testosterone. consider talking to a medical professional about vitamin d supplements if you work inside all day and cannot spend time in the sun.  moderate to mild zinc deficiencies have been shown to lower testosterone levels.talk to a knowledgeable healthcare provider about a zinc supplement.    some studies have shown that certain herbal supplements may help to increase testosterone or combat the effects of low testosterone. some of these herbal supplements include    tribulus terrestris  which has shown an increase in sexual activity in animal studies. follow manufacturer s instructions. withania somnifera  ashwaganda   which has been reported in preliminary clinical trials to increase sperm quality.most studies have used up to 450 mg four times a day. ginkgo biloba  which increases testosterone synthesis.dosage was 270 mg of ginkgo extract 4 times a day. follow manufacturer s instructions. yohimbe  which has been used to increase sexual interest and treat erectile dysfunction.doses vary but ranged from 5.4 mg  3 times a day  to 10.8 mg  3 times a day . follow manufacturer s instructions.    men with low testosterone levels may notice a variety of associated symptoms. these may include    erectile dysfunction  ed   including a decrease in the number and quality of erections smaller testes  hypogonadism  decreased sperm counts a decrease in muscle mass leading to decreased strength and endurance changes in blood lipids such as cholesterol levels osteopenia  softening of the bones  and osteoporosis  decreased bone density  hot flashes swollen or tender breasts  gynecomastia     in addition to physical effects  men may also notice mood changes associated with low testosterone. these can include    decreased sex drive  libido  fatigue mood changes  including depression  irritability  and anxiety problems with memory  concentration  or a sudden lack of self confidence    diagnosis involves a blood test along with a physical exam. the test is most often done using blood drawn in the morning. this is usually when testosterone levels are highest.   your doctor will diagnose the condition if your combination of symptoms and lab results indicate low testosterone levels.    under most circumstances  adults who have been medically diagnosed with low testosterone levels can safely increase their levels  and natural methods can be some of the healthiest ways to do so. that being said  you should avoid intentionally increasing your testosterone if you are still an adolescent or if you re an adult with normal or undiagnosed levels.   testosterone levels are usually highest during your adolescent years  but since your hormones fluctuate regularly during this time of your life  it s best to let them naturally adjust themselves rather than attempting to change them yourself.if you re concerned about low testosterone as a teenager  consult with your doctor before making any changes. increasing testosterone when your levels are already normal can negatively impact your health  even as an adult. for women  high testosterone may lead to polycystic ovarian syndrome  infertility  obesity  and thinning hair  among other problems.there s some debate regarding how harmful high testosterone can be for men  but some research suggests that excessively high levels can increase a man s risk of cardiovascular disease.  if you have no known health concerns other than low testosterone  most herbal supplements should be relatively safe to try on a short term basis. certain medical conditions may make these herbal remedies dangerous  however  so you may wish to avoid using herbs to increase testosterone if you have known health concerns.   for women  avoid most herbal supplements if you are  or might be  pregnant or if you re currently breastfeeding. tribulus  ashwagandha  ginkgo  and yohimbe are all considered unsafe under these conditions. for men  tribulus might be linked to prostate problems.ashwagandha may cause problems in people with diabetes  low blood pressure  stomach ulcers  auto immune diseases  and thyroid disorders.ginkgo may cause an allergic reaction if you re allergic to urushiols  like poison ivy and cashews. it could also cause problems if you have blood pressure irregularities  diabetes  hypoglycemia  gastro intestinal disorders  musculoskeletal disorders  nervous system disorders  seizures  skin disorders  psychiatric disorders  or heart disease.yohimbe is dangerous if you suffer from bleeding conditions  schizophrenia  prostate problems  ptsd  liver disease  kidney disease  blood pressure irregularities  heart disease  anxiety  depression  or diabetes.  if you re not currently on any medications  most herbal remedies are likely safe to use. you may need to avoid these remedies if you re currently on medications that could interact with them  however.   avoid tribulus if you re on blood pressure medication  diabetes medications  or steroids.ashwagandha may be dangerous if you re on immunosuppressants or sedative medications.ginkgo could negatively interact with heart disease agents  seizure medications  anticholinergic agents  antidepressants  and cyp450 metabolized agents.avoid yohimbe if you take or may take maois  clonidine  guanabenz  tricyclic antidepressants  antihypertensive drugs  naloxone  phenothiazines  or stimulant drugs.  as long as you do not have conditions or medications that may cause complications  testosterone herbal remedies are likely safe for adults when taken for six months or less.   beyond six months  some herbal remedies may result in complications like excessive bleeding stomach upset  diarrhea  and vomiting.difficulty sleeping may also be a result.  while moderate amounts of vitamin d and zinc can help your body produce more testosterone and stay healthy  excessive amounts of either nutrient can actually be toxic. it s usually best to get both nutrients from natural sources  but if you choose to take supplemental forms  simply make sure you follow the dosing instructions provided on the label.   the recommended dietary allowance of vitamin d is 600 iu  international units  daily. toxicity usually occurs in people who regularly take around 50 000 iu for several months  but this amount may be smaller for individuals with liver problems  kidney problems  or other health concerns.for zinc  the recommended daily allowance is between 8 and 11 mg daily in adults.the upper limit is about 40 mg daily  and toxicity typically occurs when individuals regularly intake more than this upper limit.  making healthier diet and exercise choices can be a great idea  even if you don t need to increase your testosterone levels. to get the most benefit out of your improved lifestyle while minimizing any possible risks  see your doctor before implementing any major changes.   in addition to testing your testosterone levels and notifying you

query	90	produce thyroid hormone study the functions of the thyroid hormone in humans  thyroid hormone is a derivative of the amino acid tyrosine. it has iodine atoms attached to it. therefore  its biosynthesis requires iodide ions that must be supplied in the diet in the form of tablets. otherwise goiter can result in individuals that are deprived of iodine in their diet. in the united states usually table salt is supported with a supplementary amount of iodine to ensure healthy function of the thyroid gland.    there are two types of thyroid hormones that are obtained from each other by biochemical conversions. these are called  thyroxine and tri iodo thyronine. in thyroxine there are four iodide atoms attached to the hormone while in tri iodo thyronine there are only three iodide atoms. most of the thyroxine hormone in the cells is converted to tri iodo thyronine in a biochemical process which involves the removal of one iodine atom from thyroxine. therefore  the most dominant form of the thyroid hormone is tri iodo thyronine.    both of these forms of the thyroid hormone are lipid soluble. therefore  they can penetrate the phospholipid bilayer of the cellular membrane readily. their receptors are located inside the nucleus and they exert their effect by increasing the rate of proteins translation or the synthesis of proteins in the cell.    thyroid hormone secretion is under a positive feedback control from the thyroid stimulating hormone  tsh  of the pituitary gland. namely  high concentration of tsh stimulates high secretion of thyroid hormone and low level of thyroid stimulating hormone leads to low secretion of thyroid hormone.    usually in states of hyperthyroidism in which there is excessive secretion of the thyroid hormone  there is in the blood little of the thyroid stimulating hormone. also in the case of hypothyroidism in which there is deficient secretion of the thyroid hormone to the blood circulation elevated level of tsh are observed in the blood of affected individuals. both of these effects that are observed in hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are direct result to the negative feedback control of the thyroid hormone on tsh or thyroid stimulating hormone.    thyroid hormone unlike other hormones in the body does not have a specific target organ to act upon. instead it acts in a universal manner in which its effect is done on all the cells of the body. its action increases all aspects of metabolism inside the body. in this sense  it has similarity to the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine as far as the increase in metabolic rate in the body is concerned.    thyroid hormone increases all aspects of sugar metabolism including the uptake of glucose by cells in the liver and it increases th rate at which glucose is synthesized by the process of gluconeogenesis. also the thyroid hormone increases the rate at which compounds are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.   nan  lipids  under the effect of the thyroid hormone are promptly mobilized from fats tissue and are readily metabolized in the liver. the thyroid hormone decreases the level of cholesterol in the blood. in addition  it decreases the level of the phospholipids also.    this is so due to the increased activity of enzymes in the body by the effect of the thyroid hormone. for example  the increase in glucose metabolism in the body due to the effect of thyroid hormone renders a need for more of the hormone insulin to speed up the uptake of glucose by the liver cells.  
query	91	stop trichinosis stop at a stop sign  sometimes  you will see a stop sign clearly in the distance as you approach it. in other cases  such as on hills or around blind curves  you may not be able to see a stop sign long before you are close to it. in some of these cases  you will see a separate sign warning you ahead of time that a stop sign is approaching. whatever the situation  be prepared to slow down as soon as you see a stop sign.  the exact amount of time or distance you need to stop will depend upon a number of factors  including your speed  the weather  and the physical conditions of the road. however  you should start slowing down at least 150 feet before the stop sign.if you are traveling at high speeds  if the weather conditions are poor  or if the road conditions are dangerous  for instance  if the stop sign is at the bottom of a very steep hill   then you will need to allow more time and distance to slow down.   if you stay within the speed limit enforced on a given road  you should generally have adequate time to slow down and halt at a stop sign  whether or not you see it long ahead of time.    when you come upon a stop sign  come to a complete halt so that your vehicle has no momentum.do not simply slow down or pause.   try to come smoothly to a stop rather than slamming on the brakes. if there is a solid white bar or a crosswalk painted across the intersection  you should stop before it  so that you don t block it.if there is no painted stopping line  then stop slightly before the stop sign so that you can see in all directions at the intersection. if you cannot see clearly around the intersection  slowly pull forward slightly until you can see  and come to a complete stop again. if another vehicle is already stopped at the stop sign in front of you  you must first stop behind it  then again come to a complete stop at the stop sign once that vehicle moves on.    stop signs may be used at several kinds of intersections  and different traffic rules are enforced at each. it is important to know which kind of stop you are approaching so that you know which rules to follow.a two way stop is used when two roads intersect  but traffic on only one road is required to stop at the intersection. a four way or all way stop is used when two roads intersect  and traffic moving in all directions must stop at the intersection. a t junction is formed when one road dead ends in another perpendicular to it  forming a shape that resembles the letter  t  . t junctions may have a three way stop  in which traffic moving in all directions must stop at the intersection  or they may have only a stop sign for the traffic moving toward the intersection from the road that dead ends. many stop signs will have a smaller sign below the red octagon indicating if the stop is a four way  three way  etc.    even after you stop  you are required to let any traffic moving across your path go by first.if there is no traffic  you are free to proceed through the intersection  or turn  after coming to a complete stop. if traffic is visible but at a distance far enough away that it will not reach the intersection before you cross it  you may proceed.however  you must always move across an intersection at a reasonable speed  and avoid trying to cross when traffic is dangerously close to the intersection.   only cross the intersection if any traffic is a safe distance away. the exact distance will depend on the speed of the oncoming traffic and other concerns  so always use good judgment and play it safe. remember that traffic on the road may include bicyclists  motorcycles  and other vehicles  in addition to automobiles.    if there are pedestrians moving across the intersection  people walking  strolling  bicycling  skating  etc.   you are required to let them go by before crossing it yourself.this is true even if there is no other motor vehicle traffic at the intersection. unless laws in your area specifically state otherwise  you should let pedestrians cross an intersection first even if there is no visible crosswalk.    if there is already another vehicle  car  motorcycle  bicycle  etc.  stopped at the stop sign across the street from you when you come to the stop sign  you are required to let it proceed first.the vehicle may turn to the left or right  your right or left   or move straight across the intersection. whatever the case  let that vehicle go by before proceeding through the intersection.   if two vehicles come to a stop at an intersection at the same time  a driver turning left must yield to traffic going straight or turning right.in all cases  let safety prevail.do everything you can to prevent an accident. for instance  if another vehicle starts to proceed before its  turn   just let it go by and proceed when the roadway is clear.    once the roadway is clear of oncoming vehicles and pedestrian traffic  and you have yielded the right of way to any vehicles already stopped at the intersection  you may proceed across it. move at a reasonable speed  and continue on your way.    when you come to a four way or three way stop  the right of way rules are slightly different.drivers should proceed through the intersection in the order in which they arrive at the stop  regardless of which direction they are moving in   making sure to yield to any pedestrians first. if two cars come to the intersection at the same time  the car to the right has the right of way.    when you see a bus stopped with its stop sign s  displayed  come to a complete stop at a safe distance from the bus  15 feet away is recommended . remain stopped until all children have boarded or exited the bus. even after the stop sign is put away and the bus moves on  double check to make sure there are no children in or next to the road. proceed only when your path is completely clear.    you should stop for pedestrians at a crosswalk  even if the crosswalk is in the middle of a block rather than at an intersection of two or more roads.in some cases you may see a stop sign  a small stop sign icon  or a phrase such as  stop for pedestrians.  whether or not you see such a sign  however  you should come to a complete stop to let pedestrians cross at a crosswalk.    wait until traffic clears on the other side and it is safe to proceed through. if you attempt to cross an intersection when traffic is backed up  you may end up blocking the intersection and increasing the chance of an accident or delay.    coming. let the emergency vehicle go by first before proceeding through the intersection.    follow the official s signal for when it is your turn to proceed through the intersection  regardless of what normal rules dictate.    if you think a stop sign is necessary at a certain intersection  contact your local transportation board  road commission  town council  etc. about your suggestion. however  you must make a good case for why the sign is needed  and understand that stop signs are not really used to control speed. in fact  studies have show that many drivers tend to increase their speed between stop signs. too many stop signs can also increase pollution and cause traffic congestion. the decision about whether or not to erect a stop sign is usually governed by several factors  such as the number of crashes that have occurred at the intersection  traffic flow and volume  and visibility at the intersection.  
query	92	prevent urinary incontinence prevent male incontinence  many of the underlying causes of incontinence unfortunately cannot be controlled. benign prostatic hypertrophy  neurological disorders  stroke  prostate bladder cancer  etc. cannot be prevented. however  you can take steps to minimize your risk of some of these underlying conditions.    one excellent way to reduce your risk of developing incontinence is to stop smoking. the national institutes of health reports that up to 50  of bladder cancer cases are caused by smoking. pressure in the bladder caused by tumors results in incontinence. if you need help quitting  schedule an appointment with your doctor  who can help you quit. there are prescribed medications to help you  and she can also help you find a local support group.  when you are overweight  extra pressure gets placed on your bladder. this extra pressure on your bladder can lead to incontinence. while losing weight may seem like a daunting task  it will be well worth it in the end. start exercising more and make an effort to eat healthy foods. other ways you can lose weight include making sure that you get the right amount of protein  fruits  vegetables  low fat dairy  and healthy carbohydrates each day. your daily intake of each food group will depend on your weight  age  and health. if you should be consuming 2 000 calories a day  you should eat six to eight servings of grains  four to five servings of veggies  four to five servings of fruit  3   6 ounces of protein  two to three servings of low fat dairy  and two to three servings of fats and oils.developing an exercise routine and sticking to it. your exercise routine should include cardiovascular training  like running or swimming   weight training  like doing push ups or lifting weights   and flexibility training  like yoga or stretching . limiting the portions of each meal you have. choosing low calorie snacks like fruits and vegetables.    research has indicated that men with prostate cancer had 62   75  decreased zinc in malignant prostate cells and that zinc plays a role in the progression of prostate cells to malignancy. the recommendation is for zinc supplementation  but amounts are not clear at present. consult your doctor regarding a healthy amount of zinc supplementation based on the present zinc levels in your diet.  lycopenes are powerful phytonutrients and antioxidants shown to fight cancer. five of the foods highest in lycopenes per cup include guava  8587 uq watermelon  6889 uq tomatoes  7298 uq papaya  2651 uq grapefruit  2611uq    some recent findings have suggested that the isoflavones in soy may help prevent prostate cancer.you can increase the amount of soy in your diet with edamame  soy milk  or tofu.    omega 3 fatty acids are present in a wide array of fish and seafood options  including salmon  mackerel  sardines  and bass. studies have shown that omega 3 s protect against cancers of the breast  colon  and prostate.  drink at least eight glasses of water during the day to prevent conditions such as urinary tract infection  constipation  and kidney stones that cause incontinence. you should also consider drinking most of your fluids during the day and limiting the amount of fluids you drink in the evening before going to bed.    if you are afraid that you may develop incontinence  you can train your bladder to some degree. plan particular times during the day to visit the restroom. this is a way to train your bladder  which helps to avoid incontinence.    substances that can lead to incontinence include alcohol  caffeine  acidic foods  spicy foods  and sugar or artificial sweetener.alcohol is a diuretic  an agent that causes your body to lose fluid. it also irritates the bladder  causing incontinence. try to limit your alcohol intake to one glass per night if at all. caffeine is also a diuretic. drink caffeinated beverages early in the day if at all.    kegel exercises are a great way to prevent incontinence because they strengthen the muscles of your pelvic floor. learning how to do them correctly can be a little tricky because you have to isolate your pelvic muscles. your pelvic muscles are the muscles you use when you try to stop urinating midstream. you will see or feel your testicles rising when you squeeze your pelvic muscles.once you ve isolated your pelvic muscles  squeeze them and hold for a count of five and then relax for a count of five. your goal is to do ten repetitions  three times a day.  a diuretic is a medication that gets rid of extra fluid in the body. this is usually prescribed for patients who have heart conditions. sadly  it also has a tendency to cause incontinence. there are several different kinds of diuretics  thiazide  loop  potassium sparing  and quinazoline diuretics. recognizable diuretic medications include    thiazide diuretics  clorpres  tenoretic  thalitone  capozide  dyazide  hyzaar  lopressor hct  maxzide  and prinzide. loop diuretics  lasix and demadex. potassium sparing diuretics  aldactazide  aldactone  dyazide  and maxzide. quinazoline diuretics  zaroxolyn always consult your doctor before taking yourself off a prescribed medication.    a muscle relaxant is a medication prescribed for certain types of injuries to muscles. it may not come as too much of a surprise that the medications that relax your body also cause incontinence. recognizable muscle relaxants include valium  soma  flexeril  skelaxin  and robaxin. sedatives can also cause incontinence.    an antihypertensive drug is a medication used to lower blood pressure. antihypertensive drugs can be a combination of different kinds of diuretics. if you are using an antihypertensive drug  ask your doctor about other medications available that do not list incontinence as a side effect. recognizable antihypertensive drugs include moduretic  minizide  monopril hct  and accuretic.    overflow incontinence occurs due to an outlet obstruction that then  overflows  to cause incontinence. benign prostatic hypertrophy  bph  is a leading cause because the enlarged prostate pushes against and pinches off the urethra as it passes through the prostate. however  other conditions can also cause the symptoms  which include increased urinary frequency urinary hesitancy  trouble urinating despite needing to  nocturia  going to the restroom at night a lot  weakened urinary stream recurrent urinary tract infections  utis  urinary incontinence occasion urinary retention  cannot urinate at all     while bph is one of the most common causes of overflow incontinence  it s not the only cause. see your doctor and describe your symptoms in order to help him or her determine the correct diagnosis for your specific condition.   a tumor in the bladder or prostate can also lead to overflow incontinence  so your doctor will likely perform a screening to rule out these possibilities. tests will include a prostate specific antigen  psa  test of your blood  a digital rectal exam  dte  to feel for prostate abnormalities  and or a cystoscopy  a tube inserted into the bladder via the urethra to check for a tumor . if the doctor finds a tumor in any of these instances  he or she will like perform a biopsy to determine whether it is benign or malignant.    during your appointment  your doctor will also ask about any medications you take since some of them can lead to overflow incontinence as a side effect. diuretics for cardiac problems  sedatives  and muscle relaxants are common medications that can lead to incontinence issues. some antidepressants  sleeping pills  and high blood pressure medications have also been linked to overflow incontinence.since many of these medications are prescriptions to help with much more serious issues than just incontinence  never stop taking a prescribed medication unless under the guidance of your doctor. though not medications  excess consumption of coffee  tea  alcohol  and vitamins b or c can also lead to overflow incontinence. your doctor can run a blood panel to test if your diet is too high in b and or c vitamins.    for mild to moderate bph symptoms  there are several prescription medications that are available for symptom control such as alpha blockers such as hytrin  which does not actually work to shrink the size of the prostate  but will relieve symptoms within a few weeks 5 alpha reductase inhibitors such as avodart work to reduce the size of the prostate but may not improve symptoms for up to six months cialis  which although originally marketed for erectile dysfunction  ed  improves symptoms of bph as well your doctor may prescribe a combination of avodart and hytrin to have both advantages. this is common  safe  and effective approach to control overflow incontinence.    a transurethral resection of the prostate  turp  is the go to procedure for relieving lower urinary tract outlet obstruction due to enlargement of the prostate blocking of the bladder from emptying.this technique uses an endoscope to enter the urethra and clear or ablate the excessive prostate tissue encroaching on the urethra.the procedure can use anything from a laser or microwave to needle ablation or photoselective vaporization. it is minimally invasive and done as an office procedure in many cases.it may require a secondary operation in a decade due to tissue regrowth.  stress incontinence more often relates to leaking urine than some of the more myriad symptoms associated with overflow incontinence. you may notice the leakage when you laugh  cough  sneeze  jog  or lift heavy objects.  increased pressure on the bladder due to obesity or pregnancy is the most common cause of stress incontinence. stress incontinence can also occur due to a lack of bladder sphincter pressure as a result of surgical complications. surgeries commonly associated with this complication include prostate surgery and transurethral resections of the prostate.stress incontinence can results from 10 20  of turp surgeries or higher percentages from prostate cancer surgery.  your doctor will examine your symptoms and run a variety of tests to determine the best course of action for your case. for obese patients  this may include testing for metabolic disorders  such as underlying thyroid conditions  that may have caused the weight gain.  if your doctor concludes that your weight has placed unnecessary pressure on your bladder  he or she will likely suggest that you lose weight as a primary treatment for the condition.   this will include turning to a healthy  well balanced diet in conjunction with a regular exercise routine. you can find more information at how to lose weight and how to eat healthy. you may want to consult a dietician and a personal trainer to develop the best  healthiest plan for you in order to lose weight.    though known primarily for helping women to improve pelvic floor muscles after pregnancy  men can also perform kegels to help with stress incontinence. perform by clenching the muscles that control urination. you may initially have to practice by cutting off your urinary stream midstream to get a good idea of how the clenches should feel when doing them apart from actually urinating.slowly clench while counting to five before using another five count to slowly release. perform kegels in sets of ten up to three times per day.  for morbidly obese patients  their physician may recommend lap band or other weight loss surgery options. in one study  71  of participants who lost 18  bmi  body mass index  points as a result of gastric bypass surgery had regained urinary continence by one year after the procedure.  urination occurs by a complex arc of nerves communicating with the brain and causing muscles within the bladder and surrounding areas to contract and relax. if you have a neuromuscular disorder such as multiple sclerosis  ms   for example you may experience disruptions in these signals  resulting in a neurogenic bladder. people who have had a stroke can also have a resultant neurogenic bladder if the muscles that cause the bladder muscles to contract and relax are affected.    most of those who have a neurogenic bladder will already be familiar with the underlying causes. however  you should still see your doctor for a positive diagnosis. you doctor will also provide you with the best overview of treatment options and weigh in on which is likely best for your specific situation.    also known as timed voiding  physical psychological therapy combines will power and exercise to help treat the incontinence. this combines kegel exercises  outlined in the method on stress incontinence  and a voiding diary to help you avoid incontinence episodes before they occur.   a voiding diary is a daily record of the fluids you ve taken in  the times and amounts you urinated  and the instances of leakage. you can use this record to help determine the best times to stay close to a bathroom  as well as times when you should force yourself to go  to minimize incontinence episodes.    though no drugs currently target the bladder sphincter to help with neurogenic bladder  some drugs do reduce muscle spasms or induce contractions. your doctor will help determine if one of these classes of medications can help with your specific case.    a variety of difference surgical options are available  depending upon the underlying cause for your neurogenic bladder. your doctor may discuss    electrical stimulatory therapy  which involves electrodes and a small stimulator implanted to help deliver the signals disrupted by the damaged nerves an artificial sphincter  which is a cuff that attaches to the neck of the bladder and works in coordination with an implanted pump and regulating balloon to collect the urine.    an overactive bladder  oab  is a syndrome which leads to an immediate and unstoppable need to urinate.common symptoms of the syndrome include urinary urgency  primary symptom  urgency incontinence  not making it to the toilet quickly enough  high urinary frequency and nocturia  getting up at night to go     your doctor will help you officially diagnose oab as the underlying cause. only 2  of men who suffer from oab experience regular symptoms of incontinence  so your doctor will want to exhaust other potential causes.your doctor will likely perform a physical exam  as well as ordering urinalysis to test your urine and potentially even a cystoscopy in complicated cases.findings also suggest the overactivity of the detrusor muscle  which is found in the wall of the bladder.  treatment involves behavioral therapy with a timed voiding regimen. a timed voiding regimen involves going to urinate at set times for example  every four hours whether or not you actually feel the need to empty your bladder.   this is a bladder retraining regimen  and a form of cognitive behavior therapy. trying to train the bladder to empty at certain times to prevent incontinence. a recent report has shown that biofeedback assisted behavioral therapy  timed voiding  was shown to be superior to pharmacologic therapy with oxybutynin or placebo in patients receiving treatment for detrusor instability.biofeedback is when a patient is attached to some electrodes that measure their subjective  unconscious physiologic responses. that way they can see in plain sight when their body is having a physiologic response  such as the urge to urinate  and attend to their needs  versus a  false alarm.  this ability to see factual data rather than guessing increases their accuracy of judging their bodies cues.    there are some pharmacologic interventions  specifically ditropan  which is dosed as 5 mg twice daily or 5 mg extended release tablet once daily. combination therapies  using combination of behavioral  pharmacologic  and biofeedback are common.
query	93	donate blood type prepare to donate blood  each country s blood service has different requirements in place to be eligible to donate blood. these can range from blood disease concerns  to past travel locations  to age and weight. in general  you will be able to give blood if you meet certain criteria.   you have to be healthy  fit  and not suffering from a current illness. avoid donating blood if you have a cold  a cold sore  a cough  a virus  or an upset stomach. certain prescribed medications  such as antibiotics  can make you ineligible to donate blood. you must weigh at least 110 pounds or 50 kg. you have to be old enough. in many jurisdictions  parental permission is required for the ages 16 17 to give blood. check the blood organization in your area if you are around this age. you can only donate blood every 56 days. if you have donated blood more recently than that  then you are not eligible again.do not give blood if you have had simple dental work done within 24 hours or major dental work in the past month.dental work in general can place one at risk for dislodging bacteria. this bacteria can get into blood stream and cause systemic infection.    there are many blood donation centers across many countries. since these centers need time to prepare for you to give blood  you should make an appointment. this also allows you time to make sure that all the eligibility requirements are met for that particular date.you can also look for a blood drive if you don t want to make an appointment. check local advertisements for blood drives in your area.    since blood production requires iron  you should eat iron rich foods for two weeks before your appointment. this will help you have strong blood for donation and help you better recuperate after your donation. iron rich foods include spinach  whole grains  fish  poultry  beans  organ meat  eggs  and beef.having good levels of vitamin c will also help to increase iron absorption. try to consume citrus fruit  juices  or vitamin c supplements.    to prepare your body for the loss of blood  you need to drink plenty of water or fruit juice the night and morning before you donate. the leading cause of faintness and dizziness when you give blood is a drop in blood pressure or blood sugar. the risk of this is greatly reduced if you are well hydrated when you visit the donation center.it is recommended you drink a lot in the 24 hours leading to the donation time  especially when it s warm. this includes drinking four good sized glasses of water or juice during the three hours leading up to your donation.if you are donating plasma or platelets  drink four to six 8 ounce glasses of fluids two to three hours before your appointment.  before you donate blood  you should have proper sleep. this will help you feel better and more alert when you give blood  which will help reduce the risk of any adverse reactions to the process.this means you should get full night s sleep  seven to nine hours for adults before you donate blood.    never give blood if you have not eaten that day. eating will keep your blood sugar levels stable  which will help you feel better after you have donated blood. having food in your system helps to ward off lightheadedness and fainting. you should eat something healthy that fills you up but doesn t make you feel stuffed.   you shouldn t eat heavy before your come. if you are donating early  eat something light such as cereal or toast. if you are giving blood near the middle of the day  have a light lunch  such as a sandwich and piece of fruit. don t eat immediately before your appointment so you don t run the risk of being nauseated during your donation. avoid fatty foods for 24 hours before you donate. increased fat in your blood stream might make it impossible to get accurate readings on mandatory screening tests conducted on your blood after you donate. if the center can t run all the tests  they have to discard your donation.  the requirements for each blood donation center may differ  but you will always need at least one form of id for your visit. this generally includes your driver s license  your blood donor card  or two alternate forms of id  such as your passport and social security card. make sure you take these on the day of your appointment.a blood donor card is a card you get from the blood donation center that registers you within their system. you can order one of these online  go by the center to order one  or ask about them when you donate the first time so you have them on subsequent donation visits.  in the hours leading up to your appointment  you need to avoid certain activities that may hurt your chances of donating or contaminate your blood. you should not smoke within the hour leading up to your appointment. you should also avoid alcoholic beverages in the 24 hours before you donate. you should also not chew gum  mints  or candy in the hours before your donation.   chewing gum  mints  or candy makes the temperature in your mouth go up  which could make it seem like you have a fever and make you ineligible to give blood. if you are giving platelets  you should avoid taking aspirin or other nsaids for two days before you donate.  when you arrive at your appointment  you will first have to answer a lot of questions about your general health and likely fill out a confidential medical history form. the types of questions you will be asked will vary depending on your particular location  but you should be ready to at least give them the name of any medications that you currently take and any locations you have traveled to over the past 3 years.the united blood services is regulated by us food and drug administration. they must comply with regulations set forth by the fda. their guidelines have the safety of public in mind and if any behavior  disease  or medication is deemed risky for potential contamination or transmission of disease  one is asked not to donate. it is not meant to discriminate. as such  certain activities increase the chances of blood borne illnesses and will be inquired about. these includes intravenous drug use  certain sexual activities  taking certain medications  and living in certain countries. if you answer yes to any of these questions  you will not be able to give blood. there are also certain diseases  such as hepatitis  hiv  aids  and chagas  disease  that will make it impossible for you to ever donate blood. answer all interview questions honestly. they can start delving into sensitive areas  but you should be honest so the center will have an idea if they can use your blood.  once you pass all the portions of the questionnaire  you will be given a small physical. this typically includes a nurse taking your blood pressure  checking your pulse  and measuring your body temperature. the nurse will then give you a small prick on your finger in order to check your hemoglobin and iron levels.   your blood pressure  pulse  temperature  hemoglobin levels  and iron levels will need to be within the healthy range before you can give blood. this ensures the health of your blood and that you won t leave you feeling nauseated or anemic.  many people who give blood are afraid of needles or don t like to be stuck with one. you can distract or prepare yourself before it happens to make it easier on you. take a deep breath before the needle goes in. you can also pinch yourself with the arm not giving blood to create a distraction.   don t hold your breath. if you do  you might pass out. be reassured that most people report little or no pain  mostly just a feeling like a pinch. the real issue is discomfort  so the less you tense up  the better.  when you finish your physical  the nurse will ask you to lie back in a reclining chair or lie down all the way. a cuff will be placed around your arm to make your veins easier to see and your blood pump faster. the nurse will clean the inside of your elbow  which is where the needle will be placed. the nurse will then place the needle in your arm  which is attached to a long tube. the nurse will ask you to pump your hand a few times and your blood will start coming out.   the nurse will take a few vials of blood first for testing  then your blood will fill the bag. you usually give a pint of blood at a time. this process typically takes between 10 15 minutes.  nervousness can also cause your blood pressure to drop and can lead to dizziness. talk to the person taking your blood if it helps you to feel better. ask him to explain everything that is being done.   find ways to distract yourself  such as singing a song  reciting something  contemplating the outcome of a book you re reading or a tv series you follow  listening to your electronic device  or thinking about the worthy end result of your donation.    once you are finished giving blood and the nurse bandages your arm up  you will be asked to sit and wait for about 15 minutes to ensure that you don t faint or feel dizzy. you will also get a snack and some juice to help replenish your fluids and up your blood sugar. the nurse will also suggest that you avoid certain things for the rest of the day and replenish your fluids for the next 48 hours.   you should not do any heavy lifting or strenuous activity such intense exercise for the rest of the day. if you feel lightheaded later in the day  lie down with your feet elevated. leave the bandage on for four to five hours after your donation. if it bruises badly  apply a cold compress. if it hurts  take over the counter pain medication to relieve it.if you feel ill for long periods of time after your visit  call you doctor to make sure everything is okay.

to your call calmly. do not escalate the situation if you can help it. walk away from coaches who do not want to accept your call. try to move on with the game  don t say any more than you must. you are the umpire  and others must learn to respect that.

that says something about the human condition. they are thought of as romantic and are often tragic. reading ballads by other writers can be very helpful when you are trying to come up with your own ballad.traditional british ballads can be funny  tragic  or even satirical  often tackling themes like love  work  and death. like newspapers  they are impersonal in tone   regardless of how sensational the story is.  british broadsides  so called because of the paper they used to be printed on  are more topical  i.e. journalistic   addressing events and issues of the day. these are often told from a first person perspective  have stereotypical characters  and aren t very objective.  north american ballads also deal with love  scandal  violence  and disaster and are often categorized by the groups who sing them  whether they be miners  sailors  or cowboys  native americans  etc. classic north american ballads include  john henry  and  casey jones.   ballads tell stories that often tackle themes like scandal  love  death  disaster  or even current events. they usually follow a clear  linear storyline  relying on plotted action  an unsettled situation  a climax  and a resolution  to build suspense. since many tell  or retell  traditional stories that have been circulating for generations  you can also adapt a well known tale to ballad form if you don t wish to write one from complete scratch.   often  the theme of the ballad will make us feel a certain way about our own lives. tragic ballads that focus on lost love are meant to remind us to be grateful of the lives we lead and the love we experience.  the topic can range from a significant historical event that affected thousands  to a small  personal moment you had in your own life. once you have chosen a particular event or person s  to focus on  do a bit of research so that you can pick which parts of the story you want to tell  and which are unnecessary for the advancement of the narrative and theme.    ballads use a narrative style known as  leaping and lingering    that is  skipping over non essential plot points so that more time can be spent on the interesting moments. to mimic this style  cut any unnecessary backstory  plot connections  or secondary details that distract from the plot of the story you ve chosen.   stagger lee  the example ballad for this article  is a classic american blues ballad about the murder of billy lions at the hand of stagger lee  who overreacted when billy knocked the hat from his head. salacious stories like this usually make for very popular ballads.    the opening line of a ballad is often the hardest to write  but it is also the most important  because it is what draws the reader or listener in and makes him or her feel like he she a part of the story. ballads often open with stock phrases such as the come ye all salutation.  ex.  come all ye maidens    come all ye comrades   etc.  feel free to borrow this phrase to get your story going  and make your ballad more authentic to boot . if you don t want to use a starter phrase  focus on introducing the reader to the story..    mississippi john hurt s version of stagger lee jumps right into the action by opening with police officer  how can it be      ballads typically have four line verses  of which two or more rhyme.  blues ballads  on the other hand  often have two rhyming lines followed by a third  independent line.  the easiest way to get started with the rhythm and rhyme is to complete the first verse however you like it  then use it as the basis for the rest of the lines in the verse  ex. keeping the length  rhythm  and end rhyme of each line more or less consistent .   an aa rhyme is when the first and second line rhyme. aabb  the first two lines are a rhyming pair and the second two lines are a new rhyming pair. abab  the first and third line rhyme and the second and fourth line rhyme. abcb  only the second and fourth lines rhyme. example from stagger lee  the first three lines are aab  which is the traditional blues ballad rhyme scheme.  police officer  how can it be  you can  rest everybody but cruel stagger lee that bad man  cruel stagger lee.     once again  the chorus is very flexible in ballad form. it can be one line that is repeated in every verse  two lines that are repeated every few verses  an entire verse  or even two verses back to back. additionally  you can repeat the chorus verbatim or change it slightly each time for dramatic effect.   this version of stagger lee includes the chorus at the end of every verse  the chorus is that bad man  oh cruel stagger lee  police officer  how can it be  you can  rest everybody but cruel stagger leethat bad man  oh  cruel stagger lee     use a consistent meter  i.e. try to keep the same lyrical rhythm as you did in the first verse . the meter is basically the pattern of syllables in a song or poem. most ballads use the same meter throughout the song  or the meter for the chorus may differ from that of the verses. this is what dictates the rhythm. this following poem has 3 lines  other than typical 4 lined ballads. by extending the sentences to other lines  you will be able to see it morph into a poem looking ballad.   billy de lyon told stagger lee   please don t take my life  i got two little babies  and a darlin  lovin  wife.  that bad man  oh  cruel stagger lee    once you have the verse style down  you just need to complete your story following the same structural guidelines you. don t be a slave to that structure  though. if you need to vary the length of a line or even of a verse here and there  go ahead and do it  and if you want to deviate from your rhyme pattern feel free to do so if it will make your ballad better.    what i care about you little babies  your darlin  lovin  wife  you done stole my stetson hat  i m bound to take your life.  that bad man  cruel stagger lee  boom boom  boom boom   went the forty four when i spied billy de lyon

oh  cruel stagger lee. and all they gathered  hands way up high  at twelve o clock they killed him  they re all glad to see him die that bad man  oh  cruel stagger lee    in these cases  the rhyme scheme is often aab  see above  or abac  where the two line chorus occupies the second and fourth lines  b and c  of each verse .   lines that  go together  should have roughly the same number of syllables and accented syllables.    while this is the most common ballad form  occasionally you ll find a ballad with  say  6 lines  or one with a varying number of lines per verse.   note that there are cases where the rhythm or the cadence of the ballad is more important than the rhyme.    give yourself some time to focus on other things before coming back to edit the ballad. clearing your head of the story and the rhythm will allow you to look at the ballad with new eyes when you begin editing.    perhaps you couldn t find the right rhyme  or there were just too many syllables and you didn t know how to get rid of them. see if you can fix them now. cut out any unnecessary verses  leaving only what the story needs.    whether or not you plan to put your ballad to music  you should still read your poem out loud. reading out loud will help you to locate parts of the poem that might sound awkward. if you trip over a verse  you will know that you will have to tweak the amount of syllables or rhyme also make sure you can sing it because most ballads were sung in the olden times.    don t tell him or her anything about the story  see if she he can pick up the plot and themes on his her own. you want your audience to be able to understand what you re trying to say. ballads are not simply songs  they are stories that teach the audience life lessons.    many ballads get made into songs  though they are also lovely when left simply as a poem to be shared with others. if you have a musical ear  try putting your ballad to some music.

conditions than animals on factory farms. if you can find a local farmer s market or grocery store  make that your first option when it comes to grocery shopping.   locally raised meat is usually free from the antibiotics and growth hormones animals are force fed at factories. animals raised on an organic diet are significantly healthier than factory raised animals.in factory farms  animals are kept in tight pens and cannot move more than a few feet. local farms usually allow animals to be free range  meaning they can spend more time outside and are not confined to pens.when you buy meat  eggs  or cheese from a local farm  your money goes straight to supporting that farm. at a grocery store  you are more likely to be supporting a multinational food conglomerate than individual farmers.

 almonds  and other nuts are great sources of protein on a vegan diet.the vitamin b12  often found in meats and other animal based products  is very important to maintain a healthy diet. vegetarians

by cooking your own meals at home you can assure yourself you re eating ethically.   use food you bought locally  or food that contains no hidden animals products. if you eat meat  buy locally raised grass fed meat from local markets. by making meals at home  you can make sure the products you re using are cruelty free. even when eating vegetarian options at restaurants  you never know what hidden animals products could be used in the food. in addition to reducing animal cruelty  eating at home is also better for your health as your food is generally lower in calories and less stocked with hidden sugars and fats.    there are a litany of organizations available you can join or donate to that are dedicated to reducing cruelty towards animals worldwide. do some research and find which organization appeals to your views.   the humane society of america is one of the world s largest animal advocacy organizations. they target puppy mills  animal fighting  factory farming  seal slaughter  horse cruelty  and the slaughterhouse trade. the organization works through both large scale political initiatives and hands on efforts to rescue and care for unwanted animals.the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals  aspca  is another one of the better known animal advocacy organizations. much like the humane society of america  they oppose most forms of cruelty like slaughterhouses and puppy mills and also help curb animal population by encouraging spaying and neutering of house pets. they also encourage the development of no kill shelters and provide practical assistance such as transporting adopted animals to new homes.people for the ethical treatment of animals  peta  is a well known but somewhat controversial animal rights organization. peta focuses primarily on factory farms  the clothing trade  laboratory testing of animals  and use of animals in the entertainment industry. peta often conducts investigations of companies and labs and

animals. in 2013  allegations surfaced that peta had euthanized many of the rescued animals at their virginia headquarters.you can also find a local animal shelter in your area and volunteer there.    if no existing organization appeals to you personally  you can always start a neighborhood watch in your area. invite your friends and neighbors to get to know the animals in your area and keep an eye out for suspicious behavior.   be aware of the animals in your area. by being vigilant  and encouraging others to do the same  you ll be likely to notice potential problems  such as a formerly friendly dog suddenly becoming aggressive or skittish around people.there are many signs of animal abuse. physical signs include collars that are too tight  open wounds or signs of recently healed wounds  fur infested with fleas or ticks  patches of missing skin or rashes  and extreme thinness. pay attention to the animal s environment. are they tied up alone frequently  are they kept outside despite poor weather conditions  like intense heat or cold  is an animal kept in a small kennel  or one crowded with many other animals  for extended periods  encourage all members of your watch to stay vigilant  and if you notice any of the above signs of cruelty report it to your group and decide as a group how to proceed.    animal cruelty is a crime  and if you see abuse happening do not hesitate to report it to the proper authorities.   where to report cruelty depends on your state. contacting the local humane society is a good first step  as the workers there usually know what law agency to contact. you can also visit a local police station and ask for help.when you know who to contact  provide concise written statements that includes the dates of the incident or incidents  and any other witnesses besides yourself. if possible  get photographic evidence of the abuse.  one of the most important things you can do to endorse animal welfare is being a model for friends  family members  and co workers.   share your views. do not be shy about explaining your opinions on animal cruelty and welfare. many people are not informed about the conditions of slaughterhouses  animal testing facilities  and puppy mills. if animals come up in conversation  take this as an opportunity to keep others informed. use social media to your advantage. post lists of animal based ingredients hidden in many products  links to petitions to end animal testing  and local listings from your animal shelter of dogs at risk for euthanasia. if you have kids  talk to them about treating animals with kindness and respect. young children often do not differentiate between a living dog and a plush dog. explain to them animals have feelings and thoughts similar to our own  and need to be treated with compassion and care.    whether you live in a small town or a major metropolitan area  there is probably an animal shelter near you. directories of animal shelters are available online. find a shelter close to you  whose values you agree with  and look into volunteering.   most shelters have some form of training or certification program you must undergo before beginning to volunteer. make sure you know what you need to do before you can start  and work time for training into your schedule. not all shelters share the same values. for example  some shelters are no kill while some euthanize animals if they re not adopted within specific time frames. make sure you agree with the values of the shelter you choose. a lot of shelters have restrictions  often regarding age  for volunteers. look into such restrictions when looking for volunteer programs.    when you give money to a local shelter  the money goes to getting animals veterinary care  toys  blankets  beds  food  treats  and a variety of new supplies.   you do not necessarily have to donate to a shelter in your area. if  for example  your local shelter does not have a no kill policy and you disagree with this  you can send your money elsewhere. many shelters take donations online. a monetary donation is not the only way to give back to a shelter. you can donate any amount of pet supplies. just ask about any restrictions beforehand. some shelters have bans on particular brands of food  litter  and toys. if you re getting married or throwing a big party  you can donate part of your gift registry. you can request that guests donate to a particular shelter rather than buying you a present.  if you re unable adopt an animal of your own  many shelters have programs where you can foster an animal until they find a permanent home.   there are a variety of reasons animal shelters seek fosters. the shelter is sometimes not big enough to house all the animals. an animal may be recovering from surgery or sickness and cannot be around other animals. some animals do not do well in shelters and show signs of stress and need extra socialization.many people worry about getting attached to their foster pet. this is a risk. most shelters allow foster homes to adopt their pets if they meet all the requirements. however  if you cannot adopt your foster pet the experience is still rewarding. fostering frees up space for other animals and allows the shelter to learn more about the foster pet s personality  upping that pet s chances at finding a permanent home. reminding yourself of these benefits can help with some of the emotional difficulty.  if you have the time and space  consider adopting a pet from the shelter. this is a direct way to improve the life of animal that s suffering.   adopting can save a life  as 2.7 million shelter pets are euthanized each year. because of limited space  pets are sometimes euthanized if they cannot find homes.adoption takes business away from puppy mills. puppy mills are factory style breeding facilities where house dogs in poor conditions  keeping them in very small cages and breeding them over and over again. when dogs are no longer able to breed  they are often abandon or killed.

office pool participants is that the person with the least knowledge of the sport always wins the march madness pool. while it can happen  and is extremely frustrating  there s really no advantage in

you re not brave  it s that it s just not worth taking that sort of risk. in fact  don t risk taking any team above the 12 seed in the first round unless you re absolutely sure it s a mismatch. if you pick a 13  14  15  or 16 seed to win in the first round  you re picking against a team that  based on seeds  should be going to the sweet 16 as long as they take care of business. however  also

defense  and therefore adapt easily to the variety of teams they might face during the tournament.   look at teams who can execute a full court press. full court press is a little more popular in

query	119	get insurance tiscali get commercial property insurance  the state in which your business is located may require specific minimum amounts of commercial property insurance. these requirements represent the minimum commercial property insurance you must purchase for your business.you can contact your state s insurance commission to find out if there are any insurance requirements that apply to your business. you also might check with a local small business association or chamber of commerce. these organizations typically have information about state or local insurance requirements. business organizations and industry associations also may have discounts with particular insurance companies that you can take advantage of.    your commercial property may face different risks depending on where it is located and the prevalent weather threats in that area. specific threats may dictate whether you need to purchase additional coverage.for example  if you have an oceanfront surf shop  you may need to be covered for floods  hurricanes  and wind damage. on the other hand  if your business is located in the midwest  you wouldn t necessarily be worried about hurricanes   but tornadoes may be a concern. the risks your property face don t just depend on its location  but also the type of building you want to insure  how old it is  and the materials with which it was built. different types of businesses may face different risks  or be threatened by the same risk to a different degree. for example  computer hackers are a risk to every business  but if you are a software developer  corruption to your files could destroy your business   as well as your reputation.    if you are leasing your business s space  the property owner likely has property insurance. however  that insurance will not cover any damage or loss to your property  including fixtures  inventory  and business assets.if you are leasing your property  you need to contact the owner and find out what is covered under their commercial property insurance policy so you can get tenant coverage for your business assets that aren t protected. however  if you own the property  you typically can find coverage that covers the building itself as well as the assets inside. take an inventory of your business assets and determine which  if any  are already covered under an existing insurance policy. keep in mind that the more you want commercial property insurance to cover  the more you ll typically pay in terms of your premiums. in addition to the building itself  consider whether you want to include the grounds surrounding the building and any other property  such as a warehouse used for storage.    commercial property insurance may include a number of different types of coverage for different types of losses. while generally it s better to be over insured than to be under insured  you don t want to purchase insurance you don t need and likely will never use.if you re leasing a building  look for  building occupied by the insured  coverage. this covers your business property and other damages or loss to your business. you also can purchase business interruption coverage  which pays you the income you would have made while your business is down  for example if the building is hit by a hurricane or tornado and you have to close for several weeks. specific machinery  such as boilers or compressors  can be covered specifically. this coverage typically must be purchased separately as an endorsement  and covers losses that result from a machinery malfunction. if you have particular items of value  such as fine art or valuable papers such as original business documents  you can get an endorsement to provide additional coverage specifically for those items. other endorsements may be available based on the type of business you operate and the risks associated with that business.    if your business has several locations  some may face greater risks than others. you want to keep this in mind as you search for commercial property insurance policies so that you can make sure each location is covered adequately.if the risks differ significantly between locations  you may save money by purchasing separate commercial property policies for each of the locations  rather than grouping the properties together under the same policy. for example  if you own one surf shop on the boardwalk and another location 20 miles  32.2 km  inland  the boardwalk location may require additional coverage and be more expensive to insure than the inland location. however  you can save money with a separate policy for the inland location  since it doesn t face the same risks associated with the boardwalk location.    to get quotes for commercial property insurance  find agents or insurance companies located near your business that sell commercial property insurance. while many national insurance companies offer these policies  you may get better rates from a local agent.most insurance agents and insurance companies have websites. you can find agents near you by doing a general search on the internet. if you know other business owners nearby in your industry  you may want to ask them if they can recommend a particular insurance company for your commercial property insurance. small business associations or your local chamber of commerce also may be able to provide you with recommendations.    before you get a quote or have any dealings with a particular insurance company or agent you found in your search  make sure their license is in good standing.in most cases this should not be a problem  however  better safe than sorry. if you don t get your policy through a licensed agent  you may not be covered when you have a claim. most state insurance commissions or boards have a directory on their website. you can find out if the individual agent or company you re interested in has coverage by searching their name in the directory. some agents or companies may have more than one location in your area. make sure you re checking for the correct location where you plan to get your policy.    to get a commercial property insurance quote  you ll have to provide the insurance company with some basic information about your business and the location of the property you want to insure.the value of the property you want to insure will determine how much you ll have to pay for coverage. for this reason  it s important to include everything  and provide as many details as possible. if you haven t already  take an inventory of your business and its assets. you ll want to know the value of all your business property  as well as the approximate value of the building itself. this may mean you need to get an appraisal if your commercial property has not been appraised recently.    getting several quotes allows you to comparison shop to find the best premiums on coverage that adequately meets your insurance needs for your property and business.the insurance agent typically will have a brief application you can complete to request a quote for commercial property insurance. if possible  try to request several different quotes from each company  so you can properly evaluate the cost of the insurance with any additional endorsements. you ll also want to look at the cost of the insurance at different deductible levels. generally  the higher your deductible  the less your premium will be. if you re unable to find a private insurance company that will insure your commercial property  contact your state insurance commission and see if they offer insurance for business owners in your situation.    if you have replacement cost coverage  that means the insurance will pay the full cost to replace lost or damaged property. with cash value coverage  you ll only get the actual cash value of your property  minus depreciation.replacement cost coverage generally is more expensive than cash value coverage. however  replacement cost coverage may make more sense if you have business assets that depreciate relatively quickly  such as computers. otherwise  you may not get enough money from cash value coverage to purchase new computers if your computers are lost as the result of a disaster. replacement cost coverage also makes sense if you have machines that you use in manufacturing your products that are rare and difficult to replace  or have to be custom built.    your business must be able to pay the premiums for the coverage you choose. beyond premiums  your deductible will be an important consideration in the event you make a claim.generally  your total insurance coverage shouldn t represent more than 15 percent of your total operating budget. however  keep in mind that this includes not only commercial property insurance  but all other insurance  such as professional liability insurance or workers  compensation insurance. if you re close to going over your budget  you may want to take a second look at any endorsements or extra coverage you thought you needed. you want to get enough insurance that if disaster strikes  it won t mean the end of your business. at the same time  you may have extra coverage that you don t really need.    while you may be able to purchase your policy online  meeting with an agent in person can help you better understand your policy. you also have the opportunity to start a relationship with the person who will be handling your policy.having a good agent who understands your business and your needs may be the most important part of finding a good commercial property insurance policy. when you meet with the agent  think of it like an interview. if you wouldn t trust them in a job with your company  you probably shouldn t trust them to handle your insurance needs. look for an agent who puts the needs of your business  rather than their sales goals  first. if an agent keeps pressuring you to buy an endorsement or other coverage that you don t think you need  go elsewhere.    when you meet with your chosen agent  have them explain your policy to you in detail. come armed with plenty of questions about your coverage and the procedures you must follow to make a claim.your agent should be able to explain your policy in great detail  using language that you understand. ask them how your policy was valued  and how risks were assessed. you also want to find out the agent s claim procedure  and how quickly claims are handled. make sure you understand your deductible and how it works  as well as what specific items are covered under your policy. you also want to make sure you understand what your policy doesn t cover. for example  if flooding isn t covered by your policy and your business is located in a flood prone area  this is something you may want to add.    once you re satisfied that the policy you ve chosen will adequately meet your business s insurance needs  you ll have some documents to sign before your coverage will take effect.you may sign paper documents in person  or you may be able to submit an electronic signature online to activate your policy. make several copies of your property documents and keep them in different locations. although it may make sense to keep a copy in your office  you also should have another copy at home  so you have it if your commercial property is destroyed or otherwise inaccessible.    whether you must pay your entire annual premium up front or are allowed to pay in installments generally depends on the insurance company. if you pay in installments  however  you may end up paying slightly more for coverage.how you choose to pay your premium will depend on how much the policy will cost you annually. for example  if your commercial property insurance is several thousand dollars  it may not be possible for you to pay it all at once. in contrast  if your annual premium is less than a thousand dollars  you should try to pay it all at once. this saves you from having to worry about missing a payment accidentally  which could result in loss or suspension of coverage. make sure you save your receipts for all premium payments. keep them with your other insurance and business records.  
query	120	extend visa visa inc. file for a travel visa  why are you traveling to the foreign country in question  knowing the purpose of your travel is very important because if you know your purpose of travel  you will be able to determine what visa category applies to you and will  therefore  be able to file for the correct visa. equally important is knowing that you should never try to file for a visa category that does not match the purpose of your travel  e.g. do not file for a visitor visa if you are intending to travel for work or study .    are you visiting a foreign country for a holiday  if yes  then you need a visitor visa  a limited term  non immigrant visa  unless the country to which you are travelling does not require a tourist visa for persons who hold your nationality. e.g. americans traveling for tourism do not need a visitor visa to travel to finland for stays under 90 daysor to travel to canada for stays under 180 days.  are you traveling to a foreign country to study  if yes  then you need a student visa unless the country to which you are traveling does not require student visas of persons who hold your nationality. for example  if you hold the nationality of a country that is a member of the european union  then you do not need a student visa to study in another member state of the european union.on the other hand  if you hold an american passport and wish to study in the united kingdom for a period greater than 6 months  you do need a student visa.  did you just get a job in a foreign country  if yes  then you need a work visa  unless the country to which you are traveling does not require work visas of persons holding your nationality. e.g. if you are a citizen of a european union member state  you may work in another member state without a work visa.on the other hand  if you are an american citizen wishing to work in  for example  belgium  you will need a work visa  also known as a  work permit.   will you only be spending a very short period of time in country a en route to country b  if so  then you will need what is known as a transit visa unless country a does not require a transit visa for persons holding the nationality that you hold and you meet certain requirements.   for example  if you hold american citizenship  and  therefore  an american passport   you can transit through australia without a transit visa if you enter australia by aircraft  hold a confirmed onward booking to leave australia within 8 hours of arrival by the same or another aircraft  you do not leave the airport transit lounge except to continue your journey  and you hold the documentation necessary to enter your country of destination.on the other hand  you may hold a passport that does not belong to the list of exempt nationalities  in which case you will need a transit visa even if you meet the above criteria. note that a transit visa is inappropriate if your transit period lasts greater than a few days  and in those cases  you will normally require a visitor or tourist visa.    are you traveling to a foreign country in order to settle there  if so  then you need to apply for an immigrant visa. unlike non immigrant visas  such as visitor  student  or temporary work visas  an immigrant visa requires the intention of permanently settling in the foreign country in question. you may be eligible for an immigrant visa  for example  if you have married a citizen of the foreign state in question or because you qualify on the basis of financial investment. if your purpose of travel is to immigrate to the foreign country in question  then the application process will generally be lengthier and will have more stringent requirements in terms of the documentation required.    once you have identified your purpose of travel  locate an online visa wizard at a consular website. these wizards can help you determine whether or not you require a visa  and what type of visa you require  when travelling to the foreign country in question. the wizard asks you certain questions  e.g. which country issued your passport and what your purpose of travel is  and guides you to the correct visa application based on your answers. you can locate a visa wizard by typing in a search engine the name of the country to which you are traveling followed by the words  embassy  or  consulate . this should take you to the official website of the country s embassy or consulate. on this website  you can check to see if that country s consular website provides an online visa wizard.   if you are traveling to the united states  you can access the us state department s visa wizard at http   travel.state.gov content visas en general visa wizard.html. if you are traveling to the united kingdom  visit https   www.gov.uk check uk visa y to check if you require a visa  and if so  what type of visa  to travel to the united kingdom. if you are traveling to australia  access the australian department of immigration and border protection s visa wizard at https   www.border.gov.au trav visa onli. similar visa wizards may be available for other countries. check by typing in the name of the country to which you are traveling in a search engine to locate that country s consular website to determine if that website offers a visa wizard. if it does not  you may use the contact information provided on that website for questions about visas. these websites generally answer the most common questions you might have about visas and provide detailed guidance on how to file for a visa and what visa categories  if any  apply to you.    now that you have located the consular website of the country to which you are traveling  you are in the position to find out detailed guidance on what visa category applies to you and how to file for that visa. if you are using a visa wizard  that wizard will generally ask you the following  or similarly worded  questions what passport or travel document do you have  depending on your answer  the wizard will take you to the next step. the next step may be the final step if the wizard determines that you do not need a visa for any reason to enter that country. e.g. if you enter  france  as the answer to this question in the uk government s visa wizard  you will be told in the next step that you do not need a visa for any reason to come to the uk because both states are members of the european union.what are you coming to  name of country  to do  if you need a visa to come to the country in question  the visa wizard will then ask you this or a similarly worded question  designed to determine your purpose of travel. e.g. in the uk government s visa wizard  if you entered the answer to the question  what passport or travel document do you have  as  usa   then the wizard will ask you the purpose of your travel.click on the purpose of travel that applies to you. once you choose the purpose for which you are coming to the country in question  the visa wizard will tell you whether or not you need a visa  and  if so  what type of visa you require. if you are travelling to a country whose consular website does not have a visa wizard  this information should still be available on the website. a visa wizard simply makes that same information easier to find.    once you have determined what visa category applies to you  fill out a visa application online. a visa application is normally available from the consular website of the country to which you intend to travel.   e.g. a non immigrant visa application to the united states is available at https   ceac.state.gov genniv  while visa applications to the united kingdom are available at https   www.visa4uk.fco.gov.uk account register. these websites normally require registration  which means you provide your name  email  contact information  and you set up a username and password. doing so helps you retrieve your application at a later date if you need to complete an incomplete application or need to check the status of a pending application.    most visa applications will require gathering supporting documentation  which will be used as evidence to determine your eligibility of the visa category for which you are applying.   for example  if you are applying for a student visa  you will generally require a letter from your university confirming that you have been offered a place to study there. if you are applying for a work visa  you will normally require a letter from your employer confirming that you have been offered a job. if you are applying for an immigrant visa based on marriage  you will have to provide evidence of your marriage  such as a certified marriage license. if you are applying for a tourist visa  you may be asked to provide the address of where you will be staying  e.g. a hotel or relative s residence . if you are applying for a business investment visa  you may be asked questions that seek to prove the bona fide nature of your business and to prove that your funds can be traced to a legitimate source  i.e. are not from a criminal or other illegitimate source .check the visa wizard or information provided elsewhere on the consular website for information about the supporting documentation requirements that apply to you.    after you have filled out your visa application  you must submit that application along with the application fee. you may submit an application and supporting documentation in person at an embassy or consulate. alternatively  you may be expected to submit your application online and submit your supporting documentation separately by mail or in person. follow the directions provided on the consular website carefully as to what the process is of submitting your application and supporting documentation.    in some cases  you may be required to attend an interview with a consular officer at an embassy or consulate. at this interview  you will bring your supporting documentation  and the officer will ask you questions about the purpose of your visit and any other pertinent questions. after the interview  the officer may approve or reject your application based on your answers and supporting documentation.    if your visa is rejected  you may be able to appeal the decision. check the consular website of the country in question for information on the appeals process.

query	123	work lawyer abraham lincoln make an abraham lincoln costume  lincoln may have had a lot of folk sense in him  but he never turned down an opportunity to look civilized and classy. his dress of choice was always a black overcoat. so long as the coat doesn t have any visible logos or symbols  you can use any black overcoat for this.look at existing lincoln costumes or pictures of the man himself and decide if any coat you have fits the bill.   a grey vest underneath may help to round off your costume.however  if you can t find one of those  a white dress shirt will do. you may also choose to button up your overcoat.    top hats can be found at costume or consignment stores  or made by rolling black felt and gluing on a rim. provided you re aiming for a traditional lincoln costume  you should keep the hat black. top hats often come with pre fabricated lincoln costumes.if you can t find a top hat  make your own. roll black construction paper into a tube. stand it up on another sheet of black construction paper  and trace the circle around the bottom  use a pencil so the silvery graphite will show up . fold the paper in half so that the circle is exactly in half  cut out the circle  and cut a second circle out around the edge  so that you end up with a brim for your top hat. tape it to the black tube.    although they won t attract as much attention as your coat or top hat  it s nonetheless a good idea to round off your costume with a good set of black shoes. the most important thing is that your shoes are black  this way they won t conflict with the rest of the costume. shoes with a buckle are rarer today than they were then  but they also match the costume if you have them lying around.   lincoln wore size 14 shoes. lincoln s father was a shoemaker.  they are not commonly worn in fashion today but you can usually find them for sale at department stores and costume shops. bowties don t need to be done up perfectly. rather  an imperfect bowtie will give your costume that much more character. lincolns bowties were obviously hand tied  but pre tied bowties are available as well if you don t want to bother with the tying process.to hand tie a bowtie  loop the bowtie around your neck  leaving a few inches more on one side. draw the longer end under the other side of your tie and loop it through the center  tightening it as you go along. bring the longer end of the bowtie over the other end and pinch them in the middle  looping the longer end through a hole at the back. tighten it gently.  lincoln s beard was arguably his most distinctive attribute. his beard was based around the chin and allowed to grow quite bushy  without hiding his shirt collar.look at pictures of lincoln s beard and groom your facial hair to match this. you can also make a fake beard with construction paper or brown felt. use spirit gum to attach it to your face.   although he s remembered for his beard  there were points in his life where abraham lincoln shaved his beard. a woman named grace bedell convinced him to grow it out. this had the effect of making lincoln look more trustworthy and warm.  eyebrows are a distinctive trait of lincoln s.although not quite as iconic as the beard  they should be considered if you want to make a convincing lincoln costume. either purchase some fake eyebrows from a costume store  or make some of your own by gluing pipe cleaner onto thin strips of brown construction paper. from there  you can glue them to your face using spirit gum.    lincoln had a very striking face  with sunken cheeks and protruding cheekbones. one way to replicate this look is by using stage makeup. you should first suck n your cheeks. this way  you ll be able to see where the contours of your face are. next  take a grey or brown stage makeup and apply it to the area that s sucked in. blend the edges with your fingers.   because  gaunt cheek  makeup is usually reserved for horror costumes  it s a good idea to be very moderate with the makeup you use here  provided you re going for a  realistic  lincoln.you can try different variations on makeup to create different looks. a  zombie  abe lincoln can be done by using lots of white with black around the eyes.  lincoln was known for preferring to keep his hair unruly  as opposed to smooth. if your hair length is approximately that of lincoln s  you should tousle it up by rubbing your hands coarsely through it. if your hair is quite long  you can get some of the same untidy impression by trapping all of your hair under your top hat and letting a few strands hang loose.    there are endless creative ways you can spruce up a costume once you have the basics down. because abraham lincoln was a politician  you might consider making a pin that says  vote abraham lincoln  on it and pinning it to your jacket. the real lincoln was also often seen holding pocket watches  so adding one to your costume may be a good idea for the fake of authenticity.   a walking cane is always a good add on to a costume of this nature.    a good costume maker won t be limited to the most obvious costume solutions. in truth  there s a virtually endless amount of ways you can make yourself look like lincoln  without even wearing the proper clothes for it. for instance  you could use paper and black spray painted cardboard cutouts to make the costume s  coat  and  hat   then tie the pieces around your body. this approach can be called the  paper raham lincoln  costume.   don t underestimate the effect of multiple layers in a fake materials based costume. for instance a  dress shirt  underneath the cardboard coat could be made by cutting out some of the cardboard in the middle and gluing white construction paper    this often takes the form of combining the costume with a skirt and heels in order to feminize it. the  babe raham  lincoln costume is a well known example of this. you can exchange the big coat and pants for a black skirt and blouse. the only part of the original costume you should keep is the hat and chin beard.   the baba raham lincoln costume is a spoof of  sexy  versions of halloween costumes. it can be worn by men and women alike.    because there are countless things you can do with a costume  don t be afraid to splice your abe lincoln design with other costumes. for instance  a cute cat costume can be merged with a lincoln costume by taking the whiskers and ears  and throwing them together with the chin beard and top hat. if you have a stockpile of costume materials  you should experiment with different combinations using what you already have.   you get bonus points if you re able to make abraham lincoln pun from the combination you ve created.    lincoln was no pushover  but all of his recorded speeches make him out to be a very down to earth  respectable and noble minded speaker. if you want to be a great abraham lincoln  you should act with nobility no matter where you are. keep your volume levelled  and don t speak out of turn. however  when you do speak  you should do so with force and conviction. this manner of speaking is a good part    if you want to go the extra mile  try to nail his likely accent. compared to modern accents  lincoln might be pegged somewhere between a kentucky and indiana accent.look up examples of these accents and pick up on the ways in which particular sounds are inflected. contrary to what you d think  many accounts state that lincoln had a soft  light voice   like a bird .   actors have tried to replicate lincoln s way of speaking. look at a reading of lincoln s speech and get a hang for the way an actor will inflect his voice.  although no recordings of lincoln s speech exist  historians have done research and concluded that lincoln s voice was considerably higher pitched than the usual baritone we hear from politicians.his voice was however not shrill or silly sounding. if you have a naturally deep voice  try to sound a bit higher than you normally would.   edison s first recordings of human speech occurred 12 years after lincoln s death. this makes it anyone s guess what he really sounded like.  steven spielberg s 2012 lincoln biopic has been acclaimed for its historical accuracy.in particular  a lot of attention has been given to how true daniel day lewis  performance is to everything we know of the man. if you want to get lincoln s inflections and personality down  you should watch the film and try to emulate the actor on screen. take care to note the way lincoln talks  as well as the manner in which he moves.   if you were still stumped on certain aspects of your costume you should look at the way the film s costume crew approached lincoln s look.  
query	124	pass a turing test alan turing plant turing sunflowers  tall varieties of sunflowers require lots of sun and a sheltered position. tall flower heads can bend over in moderate winds  which can cause their stems to break.    you can also use fairly deep  large containers and planters but they might need weighing down to prevent the tall plant from tipping them over. heavy based pots are better  such as ones made of stone or terracotta.    birds love sunflower seeds. you may find birds will peck and scatter the seed heads  which can make a big mess underneath the sunflowers.   the scattering of seeds also means that some of your sunflowers may self sow  which means sunflowers might start growing in the general vicinity of the original sunflower.    it s best to wait until the frosts are over if you want to plant your sunflowers outdoors.   alternately  you can start your sunflowers off in a pot indoors in the early spring and then move them outdoors in late spring once all risk of frost is over.    weed the area where you plan to plant your sunflower. you can help improve soil fertility by mixing some compost into the soil.    to plant this tall variety of sunflowers  start planting in the spring. you can easily buy packets of seeds in gardening stores or online and they are some of the cheapest flower seeds to buy.   you may have less luck using seeds you have gathered yourself from previous year s sunflower harvest as these aren t always fertile.    plant the seeds about one inch deep into the compost you have mixed into your soil. leave about 20 inches  50.8 cm  of space between seeds  then water the area well. keep the soil moist until the sunflowers have sprouted.   sprouting can take two to three weeks.    some gardeners like to plant two seeds together as not all of them will sprout. if both seedlings emerge  you can remove and discard the one that looks less strong  or transplant the seedling to another position at least 20 inches  50.8 cm  away.    once the sunflower gets to be about waist height  you might want to give the plant some support using a tall  sturdy garden stake or cane. drive this into the ground fairly deeply and then loosely tie the sunflower stalk to the cane.   you may want to tie the plant in another place further up the stem as it grows.    remember to give your sunflower some water during dry periods. make sure not to over water your plant because sunflowers do not generally like having soggy feet.    slugs and snails may attack the young plants so you might consider covering them with a clear plastic bottle with the funnel end cut off to make a homemade cloche. remember to remove this once the plant starts to outgrow it.   alternately  consider using pellets or traps.    sunflowers are hungry plants. you can really help the plant s growth by giving it a weekly feed with a liquid fertilizer. avoid using slow release or granular fertilizers as these will release nutrients too slowly to benefit the fast growing plant.   you may find that the sunflowers won t grow as well the following year because the nutrients in that area have been depleted. mix in plenty of manure at the end of the growing season to help stimulate regrowth.    you should get a good display of sunflowers by the late summer. after that  the flower heads will fade and the petals wither. if you are a generous wildlife gardener  it s beneficial to birds to leave the plants where they are so the birds can enjoy eating the seeds.   alternately you can cut the flowerheads and put them on a bird table.    sunflowers  especially giant varieties  leave a woody stalk behind. cut this stalk to about knee height with a small hand saw. then either pull it out of the ground or dig it out. you can compost the stems.    sunflowers may self seed. if you don t want volunteer  self sown  sunflowers in your garden the following year  sweep up any seeds you see.   to stop them from scattering  you may like to lay a sheet under the plants to catch any dropped seeds as you remove the flowerheads and the rest of the plant. or you can hoe the area when the young seedlings emerge to kill them off.    alan turing was a brilliant mathematician credited with being a very significant figure in the birth of modern computing and artificial intelligence. he made an enormous contribution to code breaking during world war ii and his work on breaking the code of the german naval  enigma  code machines is generally agreed to have helped shorten the conflict by several years.  to mark the centenary of turing s birth in 2012  a mass participation science project was proposed by the university of manchester  where turing studied. individuals  groups and schools were encouraged to plant sunflowers to help prove turing s theories about the presence of fibonacci numbers in sunflowers. this would also help commemorate this brilliant scientist as well as prove his work in a 2012 experiment examining 3000 sunflower heads.   turing s sunflowers aren t a special variety. for the science experiment it was proposed that taller varieties were used. these include sunflowers varieties such as russian giant  giant single and giant yellow. all these varieties grow to around 8 to 10 feet  2.4 to 3.0 m  in height.    once the sunflowers are mature  you might like to participate in the science project by examining the seeds.   has a good explanation of what you need to do to identify what s known as the fibonacci phyllotaxis in sunflowers.

query	126	study relationship barbie hsu curl barbie s hair using the freezer  make sure your barbie s hair is free of tangles before you curl it. use a barbie brush or a human hair brush to gently work through the doll hair.   just like with human hair  detangling works best if you pull the brush downward with short strokes  starting from the bottom  ends  of the hair and working up toward the tops  roots . if you are having trouble detangling barbie hair that has become very matted or damaged by products  try first soaking the hair in a mug of warm water and about a tablespoon of fabric softener for 10 15 minutes.    split your barbie s hair into several small sections to create braids all over her head. split each section into three strands and do a standard braid all the way to the ends of the hair.   the number of sections you make in your barbie s hair is up to you. the fewer the sections  the more hair will be in each braid  resulting in larger  looser waves. the more sections  the less hair will be in each braid  resulting in smaller  tighter waves. choose this method for your barbie s hair if you want her to have a wavy  crimped looking hairdo rather than round ringlet curls.    use pieces of drinking straws  pipe cleaner  or aluminum foil to create miniature hair rollers for your barbie that will create round barrel or ringlet curls. take a small section of hair and wrap or roll it around a curler  then do the same for each strand on the entire head of hair.   to use straws  cut them into pieces about an inch long. place the straw at the bottom of a strand of hair and roll the hair up and around it. keep rolling till you reach the top of the hair strand.to use aluminum foil  cut strips of foil about 4 inches wide. fold each in half repeatedly until you have a small  thick strip. twist the strip to make a strong rope shape. then place a  rope  against your barbie s hair  in the same direction the hair falls. twist a small strand of hair around the foil all the way to the bottom.to use pipe cleaners  cut them to a length a little longer than your barbie s hair and wrap small strands around the pipe cleaner in the same way as with a piece of foil. or  you can fold a pipe cleaner in half  place the crook of the fold against the barbie s head  and weave the hair through the two ends of the pipe cleaner for tight  rotini  curls.  make sure your braids or little curlers don t fall out during the next steps. secure the hair with elastics or bobby pins to maintain the curls while they get wet  freeze  and dry out.   if you used aluminum foil or pipe cleaners  all you have to do is fold over the ends of each piece and wrap them around your spiral of hair to hold them in place.for braids  use small size elastics to secure the hair at the end of each of your braids. for straws  use two bobby pins per straw piece. push one onto each end of the straw piece to hold it  and the hair wrapped around it  in place.  pour water that has just boiled over your barbie s hair  or dip her head into boiled water for about 10 seconds. be very careful when boiling and handling hot water  and avoid getting it on anything other than the barbie s hair.   boiling water and handling boiled water should be performed by an adult. children should get help from a parent  teacher  or guardian for this step. if you cannot get adult supervision or you can t or don t want to boil water  you can simply use the warmest water from your sink. there s a chance your barbie s curls won t last quite as long  but it should achieve about the same effect.    let your barbie cool for a few minutes after applying hot water to the hair. then put her into your freezer to allow the hair to cool and set.   leave your barbie in the freezer for about 30 60 minutes  or until the hair is hardened frozen  before removing it. ensure that the doll isn t near open food items or anything else that could stick to it in the freezer.    set your barbie on a bath towel or paper towel and allow the hair to thaw out and dry completely. be prepared to wait several hours for this to happen  otherwise the curls will not hold.   start this process before bed and leave your barbie s hair to dry overnight for an easy way to wait patiently before your final results. to speed up the drying process  you can also blot at the hair periodically with an absorbent towel. just make sure you don t pull out any of the braids or curlers while doing so.    when the barbie s hair is dry  carefully undo the braids or remove the straws  foil  or pipe cleaners you used as curlers. do this gently without straightening out the resulting curls.   remember to unfold the ends of pipe cleaners or aluminum foil  or remove the bobby pins from either end of a straw  before pulling them out. take out your first braid or curler slowly and check to see if the hair is still damp. if it is  redo the braid or curl as best you can  and leave the whole head of hair to dry for longer before taking everything out.  lightly brush or comb through your barbie s hair if you want a fuller  frizzier hairdo. use fingers first  then a hairbrush if needed or desired  to separate the curls and create volume.   note that this method may straighten out curls more than desired  or turn tight curls into more relaxed waves or crinkles. go slowly and start with a small section of hair to make sure you like the effect of the curls brushed out before you do the whole head of hair.    use just your fingers to adjust curls as they are when you first take out your braids or curlers. you can separate the curls gently for a fuller and more relaxed look  or leave them alone completely to keep tight  defined curls.   to keep tight  smooth curls  touch them as little as possible after you take the braids or curlers out very gently. don t run your fingers  a brush  or anything else through the curls and they will stay in place for quite awhile. to create a little more volume and natural looking curls  separate the curls just slightly by adjusting the hair with your fingers to pull apart the curls a little. take it slow so you can make sure you like the look before you do the whole head of hair.    when you re ready to give your barbie a new hairdo  undo the curls simply by rewetting the hair. brush out the wet hair and let it dry again to return it back to its original straight style.   avoid using any human hair products like hairspray to keep the curls in place on barbie hair  as these will only gunk it up over time and make it much harder to create hairstyles in the future. if your barbie s hair is tangled and difficult to return back to normal  try retreating it with a fabric softener and water mixture. or you can dip it in warm or hot water again to help get it smooth.

query	130	provide scoring jason kidd be a point guard  at a very basic level  the point guard is responsible for moving the ball up the court  keeping it in his team s possession  and setting up offensive plays. this means passing the ball to his teammates to start the plays  and  when possible  scoring on his own. the point guard usually gets the ball when it s passed in bounds at the beginning of an offensive possession. generally  he ll bring the ball up court to the defense s key  then stay around the perimeter  near the three point line to set up plays.   there are exceptions to this  of course. for instance  if the defense is running a heavy full court press  that is  they re guarding every offensive player even before they cross the half court line   the point guard may not have the liberty of being able to bring the ball up court all by himself. in this case  he may need to pass it off to a teammate fairly quickly.    as the point guard moves the ball up the court  he ll usually keep dribbling it until a play begins. as he gets closer to the net  he ll come under heavier and heavier pressure from the defense. usually  by the time he gets to the three point line  he ll have one man guarding him and will be unable to keep going forward without opening himself up to heavy defensive pressure. as the point guard nears the hoop  he must be careful not to give the defense any chances to steal the ball.   note that it s generally considered a bad idea for the point guard to stop dribbling the ball before he needs to  for instance  at the very start of a play . if the point guard stops dribbling  he can t move again without getting a penalty called on him  which means the defense only needs to guard against him passing or shooting  giving them a much easier job.    one of the point guard s most important duties is to make passes to teammates who have a good chance of scoring. in general  if the point guard sees a teammate near the hoop or around the perimeter of the key who isn t being well defended  he should pass to him so that he ll have an unobstructed shot. a good point guard should have lots of assists at the end of most of his games   these are signs that he s been passing the ball to the right people to rack up his team s score. but you should never force passes.    while it s important for the point guard to set other players up to score points  he shouldn t be any scoring slouch himself. if the point guard sees that all of his teammates are tied up with defenders but there s an opening for him to score  he ll want to be able to attack the hoop by going for a layup or shooting a jump shot. if the defense sees that he can t do these things very well  they may leave him relatively unguarded and concentrate on the other players  making it harder for the team as a whole to score.   a point guard with an excellent three point shot or jump shot is especially valuable. with this ability  he has the potential to score from virtually anywhere around the basket  which means that the defense will almost always have to use a man to guard him. this makes it easier for the other people on the point guard s team to score     whether or not your team s shot makes it into the basket  the point guard should be ready to get on defense as soon as the ball s in the air. unless the point guard has seen an opening and has driven to the hoop for a layup  he ll probably be positioned somewhere at the top of the key or along the three point line. this gives him a crucial advantage on defense   because he s usually the furthest from the hoop  he s also usually one of the best positioned players to set up an early defense should the ball change hands.   beware the fast break   if you see a defender blow past you on the way to the other basket as soon as the ball goes in or his team gets the rebound  follow him  you may be the only player on your time who isn t tied up near the basket  so you re the only one who can keep the other team from scoring easy points.    though a point guard may sometimes make plays right up to the hoop  often  his  default  position will be at the  top  of the action   usually at or near the three point line in front of the basket. this gives him a good view of both teams  players  which is important for spotting scoring openings and setting up plays. it also gives the point guard the easiest  most direct path to the hoop if the defense fails to guard him.   of course  the point guard shouldn t feel limited to this zone  either. if an offensive play demands it  the point guard should feel versatile playing in any area of the court  including under the hoop.    as mentioned in the intro  the point guard usually acts as sort of a  leader  for the offense. since he usually starts off with the ball and stays at the perimeter of the action  he s in a better position than anyone else to tell his teammates what to do to score. it s very common for a point guard to use verbal commands  hand signals  and  code words  to give his teammates directions. for instance  on a given play  he might call out the name of a play that the team has practiced before or direct a teammate to make a break for the hoop with eye contact and a quick motion of his head.   the point guard s commands should always serve to create scoring opportunities for his teammates. if he s not looking for an open teammate to pass the ball to  he s trying to get his teammates to make an opening so that either or someone else can score. to get an idea of the sort of directions a good point guard gives  watch one in action. the next time you watch a basketball game  keep an eye on the point guard. you should see him constantly surveying the court  barking out orders  and giving nonverbal cues to his teammates. for instance  it s very common for a point guard to ask for a screen by making eye contact with one of his teammates and gesturing toward the defender in front of him.    when a point guard sees a teammate with an opportunity to score  he wants to get the ball into his teammate s hands as quickly as possible so that the teammate can score before his opportunity passes. for this reason  point guards need to keep their passing as efficient as possible. point guards should use fast  forceful passes to get the ball to their teammates. they shouldn t use passing motions that require a wind up motion   this gives the defenders a hint that a pass is on the way.   at the highest levels of basketball  point guards sometimes use no look passes  behind the back passes  and complicated fake out moves to great effect. however  unless you re experienced with these sorts of moves  don t count on them during a game. never attempt a flashy or showy pass when a simple chess pass will work just as well. be wary of passing the ball into  or through  a crowd  even if the person you intend the ball to go to is open. the more defenders your pass sends the ball near  the bigger chance it ll be intercepted.    as mentioned above  it s a big bonus to the offense if the point guard is a credible scoring threat. if the defense believes you have the ability to score  they ll guard you  freeing up your other teammates. the best way to be a scoring threat to the defense is to score points when you can. if the defense leaves you unguarded  punish them for it.   for instance  let s say you pass the ball to a teammate  but they re quickly covered and can t shoot. if the defender who was guarding you follows the ball  you ll want to get the ball back from your teammate right away so that you can shoot   odds are that your teammate can pass you the ball faster than your defender can run back to you. note  however  that this requires both you and your teammate to be aware of what the defense is doing. if you ve got a defender in front of you when you re trying to shoot  one way to open up a clear shot is to use a pump fake. basically  you want to try to start your normal shooting motion  then suddenly stop it. plant your feet  bend your knees  grab the ball with both hands  and bring it up to your nose as if you re about to shoot. if done well  your defender may jump to block the shot  giving you the opportunity to quickly blow around him or time your shot so that you make it just as he s hitting the ground.    because the point guard has the ball for much of the time that it s in his team s possession  he can essentially control how  fast  the game moves. if he takes his time getting the ball up the court and taking a shot  he s said to be  slowing the game down   whereas if he immediately sprints up the court or passes to an open teammate for the shot  he s said to be  speeding the game up.  both can be smart choices depending on the circumstances of the game. below are just a few examples of situations that might lead you to speed up or slow down play your team is in the lead after a few successful fast breaks  but your teammates are looking tired. in this case  slow the game down to give them a chance to recuperate during your possession   you ll probably be better off in the long run even if you don t score points immediately. your opponents are visibly tired. in this case  look for an opening for a fast break to speed the game up and score some easy points   the defense doesn t get to decide the tempo of the game  so take advantage of their fatigue  you ve started a fast break  but your opponents have gotten up the court before you and are guarding the basket. in this case  don t drive into a crowd of defenders   instead  stay at the perimeter and wait for your teammates to catch up.    just like on offense  the point guard usually stays at the perimeter of the key or near the three point line on defense. this positions him well to guard the opposing team s point guard  essentially playing the reverse of the role that he played on offense. this allows you to put the pressure on the opponent s point guard that s needed to prevent him from simply shooting or driving to the hoop as soon as he get up court.   as on offense  however  there are plenty of cases in which you ll need to move from this default position depending on what the offense does. for instance  if the point guard passes the ball to a teammate and then moves toward the hoop  you ll want to stay on him  denying him an easy path to the basket. in this case  there s a chance that he s looking to get the ball back under the hoop for an easy lay up  so stay between him and the hoop.    it s a common saying in basketball that defense is 90  heart  10  skill   in other words  the strategy is simpler  but your physicality is more important. to be the most effective defensive player you can be  be conscious of the way you re using your body to guard your opponent. below are some general defensive tips for point guards    stay low. keeping your shoulders low and your hips back while you guard an opponent makes it easier for you to react to his motions   especially if he tries to blow around you. keep your hands ready. most defensive players keep at least one hand up when their opponent is within shooting range to block his shots. many also like to keep one hand low to block passes and make steal attempts. stay about an arm s length from your opponent. if you re too far away  your opponent may be able to get a shot off before you block him  but if you re too close  he ll have an easy time blowing around you. have quick footwork. use choppy  short steps like a lineman in football. the quicker your steps are  the quicker you ll be able to react to an opponent s change in direction.    since you re guarding the opponent s point guard  you ll need to be on the lookout for lots of passes. it s almost impossible to block every pass  and if you try to  your opponent will quickly learn to fake you out and go to the hoop. instead  try to be aware of where the other offensive players are so that  when you see a pass coming  you can get in front of your opponent s pass right as he s making it for an interception attempt. the balance between pass blocking and guarding the point guard is a tricky one  so point guard who are good on defense are highly prized.   because he s facing away from the hoop  it s usually harder for a defensive point guard to have a good idea of what s happening on the court than an offensive one. you may take quick looks behind you and to your sides to get a sense for the offense s positioning  but don t take your eyes off of your man for too long or he ll be wide open for a shot.    as noted above  sometimes  the point guard is the only defender who s in position to defend against an opposing team s fast break. in this case  try to stay between the ball carrier and the hoop. don t let him get ahead of you or he ll have an easy time scoring. be ready to follow him all the way to the basket   most fast breaks will end with a layup attempt.   fast breaks are extra hard to defend against if two offensive players are coming at you at once. in this case  you ll want to avoid committing too heavily to either player. if you do  he ll pass it to the other one and you won t have time to react before he scores. try to stay ahead of both players and between them and the basket. balancing your attention between both players slows them down and gives the rest of your team time to catch up. if one player stops dribbling before he s very close to the hoop  be ready to box out the other player and go for the rebound. if either player has an easy shot near the hoop  be ready to block it.    compared to the other players  the point guard usually has a special relationship with his coach. the point guard is responsible for running the coach s offensive plays on the field but also must have the knowledge of the coach s overarching game plan necessary to call plays on the fly when needed. for these reasons  a point guard will need to understand the coach s offensive playbook better than anyone else on the team  and will need to be able to execute the coach s instructions as he gives them during the game .   in addition  since he s usually in control of the ball at the start of the play  the point guard is tasked with performing certain special duties like calling a time out. knowing when to do these things requires him to be aware of both his coach s plan and the circumstances of the game  especially late in the game when time outs and other stalling tactics are common .    a point guard who can t communicate with his teammates on the court can be a major liability to his team. point guards should be able to use their voice and body to direct their teammates to set up scoring opportunities  execute plays  and so on. a big part of developing these communication skills is putting in lots of practice as a team so that every member knows what sorts of signals to expect and how each member communicates as a player.   the point guard may want to talk to his teammates and agree on a system of signals  code words and so on to keep his team s strategy secret on the court. for instance  if the point guard raises a fist when he s at the top of the key  this can be a signal for the small forward to cut back the three point line and get ready for a pass.    because of your unique position  your other teammates  especially inexperienced ones  may look to you to  set the tone  for your games and practices. a good point guard takes the game seriously  puts in hard work at practice  listens to his coach  and seeks to improve his game outside of practice. just as importantly  he also encourages his teammates to do the same. by earning the respect of his teammates through work and dedication  the point guard can improve the team s communication and help develop valuable on the court camaraderie.    professional basketball has no shortage of great point guards   some are all time league legends  while some are active players today. watching these point guards dominate the court can be inspiring  humbling  and educational for amateur point guards looking to up their game. here are just a few nba point guards who are considered to be some of the best to ever play the position isiah thomas stephen curry gary payton magic johnson jason kidd john stockton james harden russell westbrook dwayne wade

query	140	beat niculescu serena williams get serena vander woodsen s hair  a hallmark of serena s style is that her hair is long and flowing. you want your hair to fall at least to your mid back.   if you have short hair  you can use extensions to achieve that added length. go to a salon to have your extensions put in  or put in clip on extensions yourself.you can find these at most beauty supply stores  or order them online. if you plan on going to a salon  feel free to buy glue on or sew in extensions. you can also ask your stylish to cut and color your hair while you have your extensions in to make them look more seamless. you should buy extensions made from human hair because you can t use hot tools on synthetic extensions.you can style extensions like you should style your own hair  but brush delicately when you have clip on extensions in  as these can come out.    you want your hair to be either slightly wavy or straight before you begin to style it.   if your hair is naturally straight or wavy  you won t need to create a base style. if your hair naturally forms tight ringlets  however  you ll want to either straighten your hair with a flat iron or blow dry it straight. if you straighten your hair either way  make sure you first apply a heat protectant serum  spray  or mousse.    if you are really committed to maintaining serena s style  you might want to consider getting your blonde touched up.   if you have bright blonde hair  you could get some blonde low lights to add depth to your waves. if your hair is a darker blonde  chunky and bright highlights would give you that sunny  textured glow. if you decide to color your hair  go to a local salon  especially if you re planning on highlights  rather than trying to add color yourself.    before you start curling  you want to make sure your hair is prepped and ready.always use a heat protectant before using styling tools to keep your hair healthy and easy to work with. if you recently washed your hair  make sure it is completely dry before you start to curl.    while you re prepping your hair  you want to let your curling iron heat up.   a one inch curling iron is a good  universal size for creating a wavy look. use the low or medium setting for thin and fine hair. only use a high setting on your curling iron if you have thick  coarse hair. anything over 340 degrees fahrenheit runs the risk of damaging your hair.  for serena s natural look  you ll want to give your hair a slight side part before you begin curling.   this will help you curl your hair in a way that looks natural.    before you begin curling  clip up the top layer of your hair. this will make curling more manageable.   if you have really thin hair  you might not need to curl the top and bottom layers of your hair separately.    you want to start in the back of your head and work forwards.   since serena has soft waves  you can curl relatively large sections of hair at a time. curl your hair in a clockwise direction away from your face for the most natural look. hold the curling iron with the end pointed down at the floor  and curl your hair around it. instead of clipping the end of your hair in first  wind it around the barrel of the curling iron  and clip the end last. don t hold your hair on the curling iron for too long. two to three seconds for each curl should be plenty of time. once you release a curl  don t touch it. this will give it time to set. after you finish the bottom section of your hair  unclip the top of your hair  and begin curling it.    once you ve curled all the sections of your hair  spritz them with a texturizing hairspray.   after you spray your hair  spray your hands with the same spray. run your fingers through your curls to break them up  and create a looser  more natural look.    if you already have naturally wavy hair  you might only need a diffuser to create serena s effortless but chic waves.   a diffuser is simply an attachment for the end of your hair dryer. dampen your hair  or wash it  and let it partially air dry. apply a hair gel or mousse to enhance your natural hair texture. don t forget to also work in some heat protectant. turn your head over  and begin scrunching up the ends of your hair until it is completely dry. then  flip your head back over  and run your fingers through your waves. finish with a texturizing hair spray.    wavy hair is universally flattering  but if you have a long face  you should try to add a slightly more defined curl to the top layer of your hair for volume and roundness.    before you begin styling your hair  use shampoo and conditioner to wash it thoroughly.   use a wide toothed comb to get out any tangles while it s still wet. be careful not to tear your hair as you comb it.    you want it to be about 90  dry when you put it up. it should be damp  not wet.   if you already prepped your curly hair by straightening it  you can simply dampen your hair slightly rather than washing it again.    use your fingers to work a gel or mousse into your hair while it s damp.   this will give your air dry style more hold and definition. it will also combat frizz.    it s all right if you have some bumps in your hair  as serena s finished style is casual.    to do this  grab the end of your pony  and twist it tightly. once you have created a hair rope  twist this around the base of your ponytail.   tuck the end of ponytail into the elastic. use bobby pins to secure the sides of the bun if you don t want to use elastic  as this can cause breakage in fine hair  use spiral bobby pins or large plastic clips to secure your bun. it doesn t need to be extremely tight.    if you have shorter hair framing your face  pin it back behind your ears with bobby pins. this will help it to dry to look natural and swept back.    your hair will set and dry as you sleep.    in the morning  when your hair is dry  take out your bobby pins  and let your hair loose.   run your fingers through your hair to break up your waves. if you want  set your finished serena style with hairspray.

query	142	live with passion tony robbins re ignite passion in a marriage  passion is a phenomenon that is created. it is not a spontaneous thing that just happens. in order to understand how to create passion  you must do two things. first  you need to understand why you feel passion. then you need to understand how passion is created.    do you have a job that you love  is there a hobby you can t live without  maybe you have a talent you live for.   regardless of what it is  there are many different things in life that can make you feel passionately. it could be a wonderful career  or your brand new sports car  a young puppy  playing video games  painting pottery  dancing  pretending you re a superstar when it s karaoke night at the bar  etc. the list is endless. take a moment and try to identify the things you have in your life that make you feel passion.    now that you have identified what it is that makes you feel this way  think about why it is that these things make you feel passionate. why are you passionate about your job hobby talent pet    one thing you will notice about anything that makes you feel passionate is that this is something that makes you feel happy. feeling passionate is a good feeling. passions are often developed from feelings of love and happiness. it is the love and happiness we feel for these things that grows into a passion over time. therefore  with time  it is possible for passion to become stronger. never give up hope when the passion in your marriage is dwindling. remain hopeful that you will feel passionately with your partner again  starting with learning how to make each other happy.    learn how to make your partner happy and teach your partner how to make you happy. any true passion thrives off of happiness. you need to take the time to understand your partner s wants and needs. sometimes we can even be unaware of what our wants and needs are  so doing this can take a great deal of effort.   if you are having trouble figuring out what your own wants and needs are  then start by being honest with yourself. you can ask yourself and or your partner the following questions to help you learn what your wants and needs are   what do i want from my partner  what do i need from my partner to make me happy  what is making me feel sad and or angry in my relationship  what do i need to change in my life to create my own happiness       the first two questions will help you identify what you need and desire from a romantic relationship to feel fulfilled by it. the last two questions will help you learn how you can work towards making your relationship more satisfying to you.   after you answer the third question  take your answers and write down the opposite for each one. for example  if your partner s distance and lack of affection makes you feel sad  then for the opposite  you should write that closeness and affection from your partner makes you feel happy. completing this exercise will help you identify exactly what will make you feel happier in your relationship with your partner. it will also help you identify what you want and need from them.    now that you understand more about how passion is created  try to use the things that make you happy and your partner happy to create it. sometimes this means willing to compromise or make sacrifices. always remember that you and your partner are two different people  who each feel passionately about different things.   understanding how your partner is different from you and willing to accept this is a huge step. so for starters  don t be afraid to go out of your way to make your partner happy. do something special just for him or her. it doesn t have to be something big.  you can start with the little things. if she loves chicken alfredo  take her to her favorite italian restaurant. if he loves epic movies  go with him to the theater to see lord of the rings. maybe she would appreciate it more if you helped her clean up around the house. get out the dish soap and help her clean up after she makes dinner. maybe he just wants to have his space and some free time to himself. give it to him  and do something that makes you happy when you re not with him. here s the trick  though  don t just do it  actually enjoy doing it. remember  this is something you re doing for your partner because it makes them feel good  if you act resentful or annoyed about doing something to try to make your partner happy  your partner is not going to be very happy about it. when you do something out of frustration and anger  even it is to make someone else feel good  then the person on the receiving end just feels like they are the recipient of your incurred wrath. passion is not created out of wrath. it is created from happiness. if your partner needs you to do something you resent doing to be happy  like the dirty dishes in hell s kitchen  then just remember  you are doing this because you love  admire  appreciate  and respect

query	154	live in greece greece learn about ancient greece  greece as an empire was active some time before the roman empire starting around 800bce and continued until the romans conquered it.   before 800bce is a period often referred to as the greek dark ages and the subsequent era is often called the archaic era. this was where the great cities  philosophies and sciences  theatre  classical art  law and the greek language being written down were starting to set seed. this era had many rulers known as tyrants   a word we still use today   whose gradual overthrow paved the way towards greek democracy and the athenian model of government. this era artistically had influences from egypt and what we call today as the middle east and is often called the orientalization of greece. after the last tyrant overthrow in 510 bce  this heralded the start of the classical period that is perhaps the most famous. its bedrock moment arrived because of the athenians successfully defending greece from a persian invasion and this period continues to the hellenistic civilisation starting in 323bce. this era is where the empire becomes dominant with alexander the great rising to power and expanding the empire through to india where he eventually turned back. this era ends with his death in 323bce  which leads to the hellenistic era. the hellenistic era focuses more on maintaining the empire but ends in 146bce when the divided greek empire falls under roman conquest and becomes part of the roman empire.    ancient greece had a clear social structure but was more flexible in some areas.   greece in many ways was more democratic than its ancient neighbour rome as social status did not give additional rights. democracy itself is a greek word. there was four main social classes in athens  yet if one earned more money and chattels they themselves could climb the social ladder. education was an important factor for climbing the social ladder as most rights were awarded once the education was completed  but education was an expensive and private engagement with the family employing a tutor. only sparta seems to have had publicly funded and obligatory education. slavery was common in greece  however there were differences between greece and rome. the greeks generally treated slaves far better than the romans with beating and killing them as forbidden and many slaves were offered their freedom as an agreement to work better. the population of slaves however varies by accounts of being the majority of the populace  but it is still clear they were a significant part of the population and many held roles in public service. unlike the romans  slaves were not accorded the rights of citizen after freedom and they were part of their own social group known as a  metic . in sparta however  things were far harsher for slaves and a group of slaves from conquered armies were often killed in a rite of passage for spartans. serving in the army was often compulsory for men  as it was not only a way to maintain and defend the empire  but also to give skills in engineering and management.    before christianity became mainstream in 529 ad  greek religion was pantheistic and included worship of heroes as an important factor.   one of the central dynamics of the religion focused on the epic conflict between the gods on mt olympus and the titans. the gods   titans feature within the same creation myth but were divided between them and frequently at war. the gods and goddesses are biographical and personalised than roman gods and these deities and legends had a complex relationship between themselves and humans. the cult like worship of heroes such as heracles  also known as hercules   perseus  achilles and their stories was important to greek society as they served as role models and sources of national pride. the  anti hero  was also important  which is not the villain of the story  but are bland or non heroic characters that are least likely to be heroes but become or act heroically. indian and other religions were also known to the ancient greeks  with one king who is commonly referred to menander i soter  or melinda in the indo greek world   who had embraced buddhism and reigned around 150bce ruling a significant eastern part of the empire. this region had influenced greek architecture  which in turn strongly influenced the roman models  yet heading the other way  the influence spread as far as japan. the greeks also set great store in oracles and prophecies  such as the famous oracle of delphi. oracles would often fall into a trance and priests for those who had paid for the prophecy translated their expressions. after the roman conquest  many of the greek gods with synthesized were roman equivalents within rome  this functioned in a way so a roman citizen could worship in greece but the synthesis also boosted the power of the roman gods. most of the planets  excepting earth  mars  and venus were named after greek gods   goddesses  visit know the twelve olympians of greek mythology to get some more background information on the heroes of greece.    these two fields were often part of the same school  where today philosophy is a separate field and occasionally not seen as a science at all.   learn about some of the famous greek philosophers and scientists such as thales  socrates  plato  aristotle  epicures  pythagoras  zeno  euclid  archimedes and more. early philosophers were more interested in science rather than wisdom  but in the classical period  wisdom  ethics  good governance and other virtues became equally important. greece was often at war with various nations within greece  such as athens and sparta   but also outside of greece with the persian world and other nations so philosophy was an important science. the greek language has contributed much to our modern language as many of our modern names for sciences come from ancient greece. some examples are physics  philosophy  astronomy  geography  mathematics  and cartography. other interesting technologies and inventions include   cranes for lifting  road building  the antikythera   reckoned to be a complex astronomical calendar  calipers  astrolabes  lighthouses  showers  waterwheels and many more including steam and water powered machinery. visit for how to live like socrates  argue using the socratic method  do the philosophy of happiness  diogenes  epicurus    understand stoicism for more ideas and insights about greek philosophy.    the greeks loved music  dance  poetry and theatre with tragic and comedic plays as well as the epics such as the odyssey and the illiad  as well as stories of the battles between athens  troy  sparta and other nations which are classics still told today.   theatre really came into its own during the classical period  after much of athens was destroyed by persian invasions. this revival and rebuilding led a great re invention and revival of greek literature and the word thespian has its origins in greece. the greeks attended plays in vast audiences  as it was a major source of entertainment. masks were a key costume part of greek theatre and some even had brass instruments fitted to act as a megaphone to amplify actors voices. the famous duo of the two masks of comedy and tragedy as a symbol of the theatre has their roots in greek theatre. some of the most famous plays and playwrights were sophocles  who counted among his works the story of oedipus  aristophanes who had many comedies but who also wrote  the clouds  a fictional spoof based on socrates  which was later used to falsely implicate the philosopher as being immoral and consequently executed by drinking hemlock poison. music in classic greece traditionally was an expression of philosophy  as a metaphor of the harmonics of the universe with everything vibrating in harmony. it was also an expression of ethos  with certain pieces played at certain times according to their inherent qualities. later music became more of an entertainment. ancient greek music was arguably more varied than modern music as while we have tones and half tones  greek tones went to quarter and even finer subtleties to be able to make perfect balance. greek instruments include string  wind and percussion instruments  including pan pipes  named after the greek god pan   lyres and harps as well as a complex zither like instrument known as a kithara  drums  trumpets  conch shells and a hydraulic organ known as a hydraulis  these instruments later became absorbed into ancient roman music. visit write an epic poem to learn how to create your own epic adventure in the greek style     greece had essentially a mediterranean diet  but it was not entirely as varied or rich as the modern cuisine of greece. ancient greek cuisine was frugal and austere  a major influence was the city of sparta  which even today gives us the word spartan. the ancient greeks loved their wine and a frequent way for men to pass the time was in a symposium  which was basically an evening of a few men  apart from female courtesans and entertainers  women were typically forbidden from the event . the meal as it was would feature snacks such as nuts  grains and pulses as well as honey cakes to be able to prolong drinking. like the romans  great feasts were reserved more for religious grounds and the wealthy  but they were still more austere than later roman empire extravagances. bread was a staple ingredient  mostly made from wheat or barley that was ground into a paste or dried to a flour. leavened bread from yeast and other raising agents were used but later reserved for feast days only and bakery produced bread was expensive  so most food was produced from scratch in homes. vegetables typically featured vegetables such as cabbage  onions  garlic  pulses such as peas  chickpeas   garbanzo beans  and broad beans  as well as lentils. the poor often had their meals were including acorns  bitter vetch and wild herbs. fruits included figs  pomegranates  raisins and if available fresh grapes. olives were an important ingredient as the plant would survive the hot  dry climate and the infertile  alkali soils of the region. this provided olive oil as well as olives for pickling. beverages typically included water  which the greeks valued as a nutritious  life giving drink and like a wine expert today can characterise and even judge its source  so too could the water experts of the time. wine was a common beverage  typically cut with water as it was thought unmixed could be fatal or induce madness. milk was not commonly drunk  although it likely was due to the poor keeping qualities in the climate  as milk was reserved for cheese. meat was very important to the greek diet  as fresh produce was often hard to grow and did not travel well  if the poor had access to land  they would typically raise geese and chickens  but also hunted for game such as hare and game birds. sausages were consumed across the classes  but the cost of a piglet in the cities from a butcher was about the cost of 3 days wages. cooked and salted meats were more common as fresh meat often required a religious ceremony where the fat and bones were cremated to honour the gods. learn how to pickle olives  make greek bean soup and make greek whole grain olive bread for some ideas     greek clothing was typically home made and while in movies is often portrayed as an all white wardrobe  greek fabrics were often vibrantly coloured and patterned. no complete traditional costume has ever survived to modern times so much of what we know comes from artworks and mentions in ancient literature.   clothing was typically made of wool and linen  often imported from egypt and other countries in the greek empire. both men and women wore a costume known as a chiton  which was a large rectangular piece of fabric often from the shoulder height to the floor of the wearer. men often wore them to their knee height while women wore them to ankle length. excess fabric resembled as a loose tunic. it was pulled and secured with a belt or clasp  below the breast or waist of the wearer. the fabric was occasionally pleated to be more decorative. men and soldiers often owned and used a cloak made from wool that was about the size of a blanket and often served as bedding at the same time. it was usually hemmed with a border to protect it from fraying as well as adding a decorative edge. the himation was a winter garment worn both genders over their chitons although sometimes it was worn instead of a chiton. it was similar to in appearance  but not as large as a roman toga. women often wore veils and shawls  both because modesty was an important virtue  but also to protect them during travel and public events from the harsh sun and climate.    you can learn from online sources  documentaries  visiting museums as well as from history experts to gain an insight into an empire  culture and its people whose effects can still be felt today within the modern world.

considering your trip you need to plan carefully where to go  when to go and what your budget is.    in the east  the himalaya originates from a knot between myanmar  tibet  now under china  and india. the chain continues to the border of bhutan. beyond that lies sikkim  home to many peaks including the world s third highest  kangchenjunga. the himalayan range west of sikkim forms part of nepal until you reach the border of kumaun and garhwal. from here the indian himalayan chain continues without a break through kinnaur  spiti  ladakh and lastly east karakoram range. knowing the region may help you choose the suitable area for the trekking depending on the type of trekking terrains you want to choose.    consider some short hikes nearby home to develop basic fitness  start by walking slow in the beginning and gradually increasing your pace. consider carrying a backpack  camping for days together  walking on rough trails  the different food. this will help you to select the trek best suited to you. walking alone or with few friends can be wonderful  though it is easier for the young as you need to put more than walking into your day. if you plan to camp out and cook  develop stamina. if you plan to stay in local homes or tea houses  than you must know the language a little  learn the basics like greeting and common phrases used by locals.    a trek is enjoyed more if you are not particularly tired on reaching the camp after a day s march. even if you are only moderately conditioned at the outset  it will not take more than 2 to 3 days to become almost fully conditioned after a week you will either be perfectly tuned or completely fed up  depending upon your mental and physical responses. enjoy your walk keeping in tune with the demands of the land.    the experience is likely to be a cultural surprise cum shock which you must learn to absorb. you need to adjust  at least temporarily  to the ways and responses of the people and sights encountered wherever you happen to travel. only those read few books about the himalayas will not acquaint you with the region from authentic sources. most europeans who have never visited india and nepal before have wrong ideas and notions about the country. the initial experience   the heat  the noise and the street life  the vibrant colors and the multitudes of people   may bewilder and exhaust the first   time visitor  but the country and its people are friendly and hospitable. once you have spent some time here everything will fall into place  and you will be amply rewarded with your first glimpse of

trek. a kerosene stove that can be cleaned easily  a leak proof fuel container  lightweight pots  pans and cutlery. favorite food items.    good food is essential part of the trekking and here good food does not refer to costly delicacies but wholesome and nutritious diet. choice of food is limited once you leave the town and head for wilderness. in many villages there are no food outlets and the trekkers have to be on their own for food. one should drink boiled water or tea mostly to avoid dehydration. however freshly cooked food has no substitute as tinned food losses its taste after some time. trekkers should carry dry fruits  chocolates  sweets  soup packets  coffee powder  a biscuit  butter cheese  noodles etc.    as the himalayan rescue association likes to point out   the

altitude is from 3 500 to 5 500m above sea level. extreme altitude is from 5 500 to 7 500m above sea level. the way to prevent altitude sickness is to give the body enough time to get used to the rarefied air. a slow and steady ascent is vital. adequate hydration is also helpful. the body is constantly losing fluid from the lungs and the skin in the high  dry environment. drink enough to maintain a clear and abundant urine output. other measures include eating a high carbohydrate diet  climbing high during the day and coming lower down to sleep  and to mild to moderate activity during the rather than just lie around. almost all altitude problems can be avoided if symptoms are recognized and acted upon. the warning signs are headache  lack of appetite  nausea  feeling of tiredness  and sometimes vomiting. this stage of mild mountain sickness can be treated with aspirin or diamox for headache and something mild for the nausea and vomiting.    always ask your doctor for advice and read the patient information that comes with your medicine.

query	159	get into a bar in kelowna kelowna research effectively before opening your own bar  probably the best way to get a handle on the bar trade is to actually work in a bar. try to advance to the level of manager. the view from this position will quickly disillusion you. owning a bar won t consist of all night bingers with your clients  but rather will be hard work. you ll need to schlep kegs in the basement and unclog toilets in addition to serving drinks to the inebriated.  if they re too busy  make an appointment. offer to take them to lunch  because they re going to do you a big favor.   once you ve got the attention of a bar owner and at least half an hour to talk together  ask him how he started and what it takes to open a bar and run one. take lots of notes. come back several times  if possible. be nice and buy things at their bar so they won t be too annoyed with you hanging around. don t bother them with questions when the place is busy. keep in mind that if you plan on opening a bar in the area  the bar owner might not be inclined to talk to you and reveal his secrets. if you suspect this to be the case  visit other bar owners in different areas.    bar and beverage is a great example of a bar trade magazine that covers the most exciting developments in the field including news on new brews  bar strategies and themes  new drinks  and even new technologies.nightclub and bar magazine is another option and it is free. these magazines are great resources to help you figure out and hone your bar s theme.whether you want a  flight of fancy   futuristic bar filled with flashing lights or a dimly lit  quaint gastropub with a hint of dive bar  you ll find design tips and tricks in these trade publications.    trade shows have an advantage over trade publications. they get you in touch with other retailers and distributers. you can learn for the experiences of others  try new alcohols  see the latest trends in the bar industry  and get special deals that will help make your business profitable in the future. not to mention  they are just fun.each year the nightclub and bar show is held in a different city. in 2016  over 600 booths will be set up for their thousands of visitors. in addition to this annual conference  there are smaller trade shows held around the country every month. check out 10 times website for a list of dates and details on each trade show.    buy a drink at each  and take notes on what you like and don t like. try at a busy time  and then come back later at a quiet time. understand how these businesses operate and what attracts customers to them. do they have themed nights  do they have discounted drinks  do they have a comfortable atmosphere  do they attract your  ideal  customer     contact your municipal government and ask for tax statistics on entertainment  dining  and bar services in your area.   for example  let s say that roughly  1 000 000 was spent on dining  entertainment  and bar options last year and there are 10 establishments in your area that cater to these needs  then you can start off with a base assumption that each business brought in around  100 000 last year. it is possible that one or two businesses attracted far more customers so these numbers would be screwed greatly. these heavy hitters might even take up to 80  of the market  which would leave the remaining eight businesses to fight over  200 000. if there isn t enough room for profit in your area  consider moving your bar to another more profitable part of town.  ideally it should be a place that gets lots of people in your target demographic passing by  and ideally it should be a place that already has the bar and restaurant stuff in place. if you have to purchase fewer things  e.g. bar stools  booths  and chairs  then you ll have fewer start up costs.   don t be afraid to think outside the box. in some cases  it might be cheaper to outfit a space that was not originally intended to be a bar. this might even help you settle on a theme. look at disused spaces like old churches  fire stations  or even houses in built up areas with a healthy nightlife. some people might be attracted to the quirky atmosphere of a bar more than the actual drinks served there.  if you get a liquor license  but your contract prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages  you will be in a bind. you ll need to either renegotiate with your leaser or you ll need to move. make sure that your contract is ideal for a bar.  while you ve always dreamed of opening an english style pub of your own  it is possible that bar goers won t be interested in such an establishment. maybe there are already five other english style pubs in your area to choose from. you don t want your bar to be white noise  do you  while you research your area  see what kind of bar is missing and what might attract your chosen demographic.there are dozens of themes to choose from. many bar owners agree that zany themes often attract customers to their bar counters. pirates  spies  zombies  fairy tales  and tropical beaches have brought in business for bar owners around the world. why not consider creating a theme bar decorate according to your bar s theme. don t just slap up a couple of signs on the wall or paint the entire place the same shade of brown. carefully consider your bar s theme and then carry that theme throughout the place. it will create a more unique experience for your customers. you can even carry the theme down to the drinks and the foods that you sell. for example  if you wanted to have a jazz bar  you d want to build a stage for jazz musicians to play on. you could put pictures on the walls of jazz legends. you could incorporate your theme into the drink menu. offer  jazzy  gin and tonics or drum roll rum and cokes.    most likely  you ll need well over  100 000 dollars to open your bar. this number could be reasonable if you plan to open in a small town in rural mississippi  but if you plan to open up shop in new york city or los angeles  you ll need to be prepared to raise five times that amount or more.remember that roughly 75  of bars restaurants that open close within the first year.don t let your bar go out of business because you didn t anticipate the exorbitant costs of starting a successful bar.   if your budget can t survive at least startup plus a few months running without netting a dime before you have to give up  then forget it. the last thing you want is to start the bar and then run out of money before business builds up to a profitable level. if necessary  choose a different location or find some other way to cut expenses. remember  this should all be planned out before you take any other steps.    if the bar you want has not been constructed yet  add several months and thousands of dollars on top of your other costs to build it. remember that construction is a timely process and most likely will take longer than projected.    there is no formula for a perfectly stocked bar. it all depends on how many people you attract to your bar and how much they consume. some bars that focus on  beer crowds  will want to have a variety of beers on hand  while a wine bar will want to have a great selection of wines. this being said  there is a standard set of drinks  liquors  liqueurs  and mixers that every bar will want to have. saying  we don t sell that drink here  to a customer could cause them to leave  so be ready for anything.   be sure to have gin  vodka  rum  whiskey  tequila  and brandy in addition to beer and wine. these are starter liquors. they can be consumed by themselves or combined with various other ingredients to form thousands of drinks.  this isn t going to be a one man operation. you ll need bartenders  waiters waitresses  a host hostess  chefs  a janitorial staff  book keepers  managers for while you are away  and bussers to keep the place looking clean. all these people need to be paid. when you are calculating your budget  take into account your workers. you might hire a person for each job  a jack of all trades employee who can take care of many of these tasks  or you might even subdivide each job between workers. it all depends on how big your bar gets and how much personal effort you want to put into the bar yourself.  once you know how much money you are going to need  figure out where you re going to get it from. you will probably need to borrow it  so get busy studying up on loans and credit. there are a number of small business loan agents around the country. work with them to start a line of credit or to get a loan that will cover the projected costs of starting your business.  every state country is different. depending on your space  operating hours  and types of beverages sold  you ll need a different license. consult the alcohol and tobacco commission s website for the specific license you ll need.in some areas  you simply have to fill out paperwork and pay a fee  but in other areas  inspections  detailed lists of beverages being sold  and a projected ratio breakdown of food to alcohol sales are needed.    in some areas like san francisco  new liquor licenses are not distributed by the city  instead  you have to purchase a license from someone else   probably a competing bar owner. in this case  you have to buy another bar owner s business in order to open your own. in order complete the transfer  you ll need    a  consent of transfer  form from the current owner 4 copies of your floor plans signed by you  the owner a signed lease or proof of ownership of the building where the license will be used property tax clearance from your county treasurer  under ideal circumstances  your application may be approved or rejected in 8 to 10 weeks  but may take up to 12 weeks for processing if the local authorities are backed up.

websites.you can find suppliers using online outsourcing directories or professional sourcing companies. some good places to start include alibaba.com  china.cn  and analema international.   export agents in china are very commonly hired by chinese exporters. some of these export agents are also 3rd party suppliers  while others just provide export services. you can also visit trade fairs  two trades shows in china are worth mentioning  canton fair and east china fair   search suppliers on google map  check customs data  go to local wholesale market  filter sellers on retail sites and use many other ways to find potential suppliers.if you don t have much experience dealing directly with suppliers in china  another option is to seek the help of a commission based china sourcing agent or sourcing service provider. however  the fee can range from 3 to 15  of the purchase price. be aware that there might also be hidden commissions between sourcing agents and chinese manufacturers. the biggest benefit of working with a good agent is its network and relationship with the qualified and trustworthy manufacturers  whom you might find hard to access on your own. if you decide to go this route  after working with sourcing agents a few times and familiarizing yourself with the process  you can eventually manage your own deals without their help.    once you have a list of exporters  you can begin asking questions in order to narrow it down to the supplier who is right for you. some things you will want to ask each exporter to provide you with include    client references. a reputable supplier should be able to provide you with client testimonials and references. once they do  be sure to check them. business licensing information. you want to be sure that any company you do business with is properly licensed and in compliance with all applicable trade laws in order to avoid future legal problems which may affect your business.manufacturing and staffing information. be sure you understand the exporter s relationship to the manufacturer. do they manufacture the product themselves  if not  do they get paid by the manufacturer as well  the name and location of the factory producing the product. if an exporter refuses to provide you with the name and address of the factory where the product is manufactured  they may not be a reputable supplier.    request information regarding the experience of each factory in producing your particular product. you should also ask for samples of the product. unless you will be manufacturing your own new product  the supplier should be able to provide you with samples of the product so that you can get a better idea of the quality and know ahead of time exactly what you are paying for.   cost is not the only the consideration when choosing a supplier  quality may be just as important  and the manufacturer s experience can be a good indication of the quality of work.    if at all possible  it s best to schedule a visit to your supplier in china. this will help you establish a relationship with the supplier and get a sense of how well their business is operated. this provides a better opportunity for negotiation than working on a deal over the phone.the website should offer the supplier s physical addresses and contact details. if this information is absent  ask for their contact details and if they don t mind you coming in and checking on their offices. this shouldn t be a problem at all if they are not hiding something from you. visiting trade shows is a great way to see suppliers face to face without traveling to china.    in order to enter china  you will need to apply for and receive a chinese m visa  which is the visa specific to business activities. you can apply for this visa at the nearest chinese consulate. in order to get the visa  you will have to submit the required documentation and items  which includes    a valid passport from your current country of residence. a black and white photocopy of the picture page of your passport. black and white photocopies of previous chinese visas you have obtained  if any . a recent  passport style photo of yourself. a completed visa application form  available at the chinese embassy s website . an invitation letter from the supplier you are meeting. a fee of approximately  140  plus any additional service or administrative fees.it may take three weeks for your visa to be processed and shipped once you have applied for it. however  you may be able to pay for expedited service. ask the consulate for details.  remember that business interactions with chinese exporters are governed by chinese culture and customs  and different negotiation skills and tactics may be required. some things to keep in mind when negotiating with chinese suppliers include    the focus is on relationships. chinese do not do business with companies  they do business with people  and each business deal creates a new relationship with the other party. chinese exporters are therefore not likely to jump into a deal until they have had the opportunity to get to know you a little. reliance is on moral influence  not legal practice. chinese executives tend to rely more on a party s moral obligation  rather than its legal one. this does not mean you should ignore the wise business practice of having a signed contract  but you should let your desire to get a signature on a contract take a back seat to building a trusting relationship where each party will feel morally obligated to perform  even if they did not have a signed contract. hierarchy is important. shaking the hand of a low ranking executive first or calling a high ranking executive by his first name can jeopardize interpersonal relationships and affect a chinese executive s willingness to negotiate. pay close attention to how executives address each other and follow their lead.  each company will have a minimum order amount and a basic shipping agreement. most exporters expect orders of at least 10 000 units  depending on the item in question.the most common types of shipping arrangement for chinese exports to the u.s. include    carrier air mail. this service is best for samples and smaller orders  but can be costly. check with companies like dhl international  ups  and ems to set up an import shipping account.sea freight. for larger orders and bulky items  or to save money  you can use sea freight to import your items. this type of order is shipped as either a full container load  fcl   which is a full shipping container for your items  or a less than container load  lcl   which allows your shipment to share space in the same container with other shipments. fcl shipments are cheaper per cubic meter but require a large order to make the cost worth it.  to place your order  you will have to pay a deposit on the value of your order. usually an initial deposit of between 30 50  will be requested by a chinese manufacturer to get your product order into production. the remainder is paid upon delivery of the goods. never pay the entire amount of the purchase price upfront. if there is a problem with the order  you may not be able to get your money back.   remember that the wholesale cost of your product is not simply the recorded cost of the item on the order  but the total cost of having it shipped to you  including taxes  tariffs  shipping  and insurance fees.a letter of credit is commonly used in trade with china. go to your bank to get detail formality and cost. payment for chinese exports is most often made by credit card  but many chinese suppliers also accept other forms of payment  such as cash  check  or even paypal. you need to have a good estimate of the landing cost before you make your order. landing cost   cost of the goods   transport costs by forwarder   import duties  if any    local transport costs   cost of service providers  inspections  agents  etc. . there may be many hidden costs and you can consult an import management company  but the best way to avoid bad surprises is by making a first order of a small quantity  and collect all costs and fine tune your landing cost estimate. use escrow services for payment whenever possible. escrow companies allow a buyer to deposit funds with an independent third party  to be delivered to the seller once he or she has fulfilled his or her end of the supply and shipping agreement.    some importers may experience this type of fraud when placing their orders. it typically involves their payment for orders being sent to the wrong bank account  which can leave both the supplier and the importer out of a large amount of money. reduce your risk of this type of fraud by following two simple steps    don t send your payment to a bank account that isn t registered under the name of the company you are ordering from. don t send your payment to a bank account registered in a different city from your supplier  even if the name on the account is similar. otherwise  you will simply lose your money and have virtually no legal recourse to get it back.  locating and hiring a licensed customs broker can

if you are visiting the mountainous areas of north india  pack winter clothes like sweaters  long pants and jackets  as well as a few items of warm weather clothes like t shirts and capris.   in the summer in the mountains  temperatures can be moderately warm during the day and plunge down at night  so having a range of clothing items is a good idea. as you are going through your day  carry a bag with you that can hold a warm layer like a sweater in case you need to put one on as it gets colder.    even though you probably want to look fashionable  it s always a good idea to wear a pair of practical shoes that offer support. try to wear a pair of sturdy sandals or sneakers that will still be comfortable even after a long day s walk.if you are traveling in northern regions of india  wear close toed shoes so that your feet don t get cold. if you are travelling in any other region of india  you can get away with wearing sandals or other open toed shoes  which will keep your feet cool.    monsoon season in india takes place july through september  when the country experiences over 75  of its annual rainfall. carry a raincoat with you that you can easily take off and put on or carry an umbrella. don t wear leather or suede  or any other materials that you don t want to get wet.  if you don t have clothing suited for the climate  consider buying clothing while you are in india. many markets carry both traditional clothing and western inspired clothing that is appropriate for the intense climate.   for hot weather  women may wish to buy lightweight harem pants and long skirts  which are quite breezy and stylish. men may choose to buy loose cotton or linen pants  which are made of a much lighter material than jeans and are better for hot weather. traditional indian clothing can also be lightweight and good to wear in the summer. it s not frowned upon for foreigners to wear traditional indian clothes  though you should probably expect to receive some curious looks if you are not of indian or south asian descent. the most well known piece of traditional indian womens  clothing is a sari  a long  usually embellished fabric that is draped and tucked around the wearer. another traditional womens  clothing item is the salwar kameez  which comprises of a long short sleeve tunic over a pair of loose pants.traditional indian mens  clothing includes the kurta  a collarless knee length tunic  and the dhoti  which is a length of fabric draped in the shape of pants. other items include the sherwani  a long  knee length jacket style top that is often worn with churidars  tight fitting lightweight pants  and sometimes with a long  thin scarf as well.  in large cities like mumbai  delhi and bangalore  there are as many people who wear western style clothing as there are who wear traditional indian clothing like saris and lungis  and you will see all kinds of fashion and styles on the streets. however  though many people wear western style clothing  it s still a good idea not to wear anything too outrageous or revealing as a tourist.you shouldn t have to buy a new wardrobe if you are visiting a city in india. pick out clothing that you like  just avoid wearing very short shorts or skirts. if you re a woman  you also may want to avoid wearing plunging necklines. in the end you should wear what you want  but be aware that you may be one of the only people you see wearing this revealing of a garment  and you may attract stares. even though you may see many indian women with their navel exposed below their traditional short shirt  called a choli   it s important to understand that this is a traditional garment and is not considered immodest.    small towns and villages in india are typically more traditional than urban areas  and you will see more men and women dressed in traditional indian clothing. if you are visiting a small town  dress in clothing that covers your shoulders and doesn t come above your knees.if you are a woman  wear long skirts  capris or pants. try to wear shirts with sleeves that don t have low necklines. if you are a man  wear capris or pants and a t shirt or button up.    many of the holiest sites in india are also tourist destinations. if you plan on visiting temples  make sure that you are dressed respectfully. even if you are in a large city  avoid exposing your legs by wearing pants  or a long skirt if you are a woman. wear a modest short sleeved shirt or a long sleeved shirt.   keep in mind that you may need to cover your head or take off your shoes when visiting a temple.if you don t want to wear long sleeves  a good way to transition your outfit is to put on a shawl or scarf. wearing a shawl or scarf is a stylish way to be able to quickly change your outfit from casual to respectful.    even though it s completely fine to wear swimwear at the beach  you should try not to wear revealing items like bikinis or speedos. if you are a woman  wear a standard one piece bathing suit  and if you are a man  wear board shorts or trunks.   bring a t shirt along with you  as well as a skirt or sarong if you are a woman to wear when you aren t swimming or sunbathing. goa is one city where you won t feel out of place wearing a bikini  as it is a big tourist destination known for its beaches and parties.  if you are a foreigner traveling to india  it s a good idea to keep any valuables like your wallet or passport in a money pouch close to your body or in a secure pocket.this may not be necessary if you are visiting a small town. however  large cities  not just in india  but in most countries  can hold thieves and opportunists who will try to steal from tourists.    in addition to keeping your valuables close  it s a good idea to avoid wearing diamonds  expensive watches  or other obviously expensive jewelry that could attract thieves. instead  opt for your jewelry items that do not contain gems or precious metals.   many women in india wear jewelry  so you shouldn t be deterred from wearing jewelry if you usually do. just use common sense to pick pieces that aren t extremely valuable or dripping in rubies.    if you are traveling to india as a tourist  it s important to feel comfortable and good in the clothing that you are wearing. if you are not of indian or south asian decent  you will be recognized as a tourist and may attract some stares. that s why

query	173	get some scenic views over tehran tehran maintain republican views if your parents like democrats  do your research on both parties and find out what they represent. you shouldn t support or oppose a specific party just because your parents do. instead  it is your free choice to make an informed decision. acquaint yourself with past and present officeholders and candidates  views  and their actions. a good place to start your research is by visiting each of the party websites  scanning and reading about their current issues and convention platforms  party statements of methods and objectives .by having a broad understanding of the republican and democratic party platforms  you will be better equipped to have a meaningful political conversation with your parents. it will be easier to maintain your republican views if you are satisfied with why you have chosen to support them in the first place. for instance  you can explain that you are not supporting the republicans to disagree with your parents. instead  you have made an informed decision. sufficiently understanding arguments and issues often presented by democrats will also help to strengthen the basis and details of your own position  if you end up in a disagreement with your parents.    another way to clarify your political views and consequently help maintain your political affiliation is by listening to debates of some of your legislators  representative  senators and governor  or candidates for such offices. there are two primary reasons why people support one candidate over another   1  you support their platform and policies or  2  you like their presentation of their views and their leadership qualities. you are more likely to maintain your republican affiliation  if you support both the party policies and party leadership.research into the past work and outcomes on issues of the republican party in local  state and u.s. house and senate and their leadership in order to find reasons why you appreciate their views and support them.    in order to maintain your own political views and not be influenced by others  specifically political commentators and your own parents  you should personally view speeches on tv or videos  and read election materials to get info directly. this will allow you to more clearly articulate why you are supporting one party over the other. for example  watch a debate that takes place between candidates  read a wide variety of political analysis  especially written by people on your side of the political divide  realizing that the other side will often disagree with republicans on many basic issues . also  become involved in a campaign if you find it desirable.it is important to educate yourself on the major issues in any given election in order to develop your own views and opinions  rather than becoming a carbon copy of your parents. you will be able to maintain you own views more easily if you follow elections closely.  once you are informed about the major issues and platforms of each of the parties  it is a good idea to be ready to tell your parents about the basics of your views    and that you have decided to support the republican party. be peaceful and calmly let them understand that you agree with many of the republican s views. for example  explain to your parents why you align with certain republican platform  planks . you can provide them with several concrete examples to help them better understand your position.do not try to convince or convert them. it is okay that you don t share the same political views as your parents  even if it is uncomfortable and awkward.    instead  speak in a respectful manner. do not judge or argue with your parents because they hold different views than your own. this will only lead to unnecessary arguments  divisions  and polarization.   approach any political discussion with a friendly and affectionate attitude. say   okay.  when one disagrees   i think  i see what you mean. yeah... we can agree to disagree as friends on some issues.   avoid oppositional or insulting words. you will not want to say  you re crazy stupid foolish speaking nonsense   or use profanity or loud talk. anger  silent treatment  avoiding each other and being spiteful will get you nowhere.    once you have revealed to your parents why you support the republicans  it is equally important that you respectfully listen to your parents when they explain why they support the democrats. in order to be able to accept the fact that you may have opposing views from your parents  you need to allow them to express their perspectives  and you might understand how they came to those views  but not necessarily . you will likely realize  over time  that their perspective is personal  as it is grounded in their own experiences and outlook on the world. peaceful  effective communication  on any issue  requires respectful listening skills. you will be better equipped to maintain your own political views if you have a reasonably accurate understanding of why your views differ from your parents .  even though you do not support the same political concepts as your parents  you may be able to find issues that you can agree on. many people hold conservative views on some issues  moderate ones on others  and liberal views on another area. for example  you may agree or disagree with your parents about abortion or pro life issues  but find that you agree with them when it comes to same sex or traditional marriage issues. by primarily accentuating the common political beliefs you can help bridge or avoid widening the gap between you and your parents. this will make it easier for you to maintain your republican views.  if your parents are upset because you do not share their opinions and political views  then you can calmly explain to them that it is your right to freely choose which candidates and issues to support.   tell them you will always respect their views  and that they should respect your views as well. it is important that your parents understand that you have developed your own opinions based on your life experiences and they should respect your rights. you may find that your parents will respect the fact that you are independent  strong willed  and think for yourself  rather than letting other people manipulate your views and opinions.  some people will openly dispute and even discriminate against people who do not share the same political views. the reason for this is that many people tie their political concepts to their own personal identity. any attack against a political view  therefore  becomes a personal attack. if this is the case with either your parents or yourself  it is probably best to avoid continuing to talk about politics with them  and others with whom you strongly disagree . because political issues can be very polarizing you do not want your political differences to drive a wedge within your family and your associates. by avoiding political discussions with your parents you can more comfortably maintain your own political views while enjoying a strong and healthy relationship with your parents.be prepared to say  i love you  but we obviously do not see eye to eye politically. let s just avoid the topic of politics  at least until this election is over.   avoiding politics can be  peacekeeping   if you have already attempted to discuss your differing political views in an calm and civil manner.    if your parents refuse to discuss your political views with you  then perhaps some of your conservative friends  colleagues  or teachers  etc. may be more open to discussions. you might want to locate people who share similar political views as you  and save political discussions for when you are with them.    you can also help to maintain your republican views despite familial differences  by becoming active within the party. for example  you could try volunteering for the republican party during an election campaign. in this role you will get to meet and communicate with like minded individuals which can help to strengthen and reinforce your own political views.
query	174	performs live in times square times square calculate the perimeter of a square  for a square of side length s  the perimeter is simply four times the side length  p 4s.    depending on the assignment  you may need to measure the side with a ruler  or look at other information on the page to determine the side length. here are some examples of perimeter calculations    if your square has a side length of 4  then p   4   4  or 16. if your square has a side length of 6  its p   4   6  or 24.    the area of any rectangle  remember  squares are special rectangles  is defined as its base times its height.since the base and the height of a square are the same length  the area of a square with side length s is s s  or a   s2.    the square root of the area will give you the length of one of the sides of the square. for most numbers  you will need to use a calculator to find the square root  by first typing in the value of the area  followed by the square root     key. you can also learn to calculate a square root by hand    if the area of your square is 20  then the side length s   20  or 4.472. if the area of the square is 25  then s    25  or 5.    take the side length s you just calculated and plug it into the perimeter formula  p   4s. the result will be the perimeter of your square    for the square with area 20 and side length 4.472  the perimeter p   4   4.472  or 17.888. for the square with area 25 and side length 5  p   4   5  or 20.    inscribed shapes come up fairly often on standardized tests like the gmat and gre  so it is important to know what they are. a square inscribed in a circle is a square that is drawn inside of the circle  so that all four vertices  corners  lie on the edge of the circle.  the distance from the center of an inscribed square to each of its corners is equal to the radius of the circle. to find the length of s  we must first imagine cutting the square in half diagonally to form two right triangles. each of these triangles will have equal sides a and b and hypotenuse c  which we know is equal to two times the radius of the circle  or 2r.    the pythagorean theorem states that for any right triangle with sides a and b and hypotenuse c  a2   b2   c2 . since sides a and b are equal  remember  we are still dealing with a square   and we know that c   2r  we can write out the equation and simplify the equation to find the side length as follows    a2   a2    2r 2    now simplify the expressions   2a2   4 r 2  now divide both sides by 2    a2    2 r 2  now take the square root of each side   a     2r . our side length s for the inscribed square     2r .    in this case  the perimeter of the square p   4  2r . because of the distributive properties of exponents  which tells us that 4  2r  is equal to 4 2   4 r  we can simplify this to the following equation  the perimeter of any square inscribed in a circle with radius r is defined as p   5.657r   consider a square inscribed in a circle with radius 10. that means that the diagonal of this square   2 10   or 20. using the pythagorean theorem  we know that 2 a2    202  so 2a2   400. now divide both sides in half to find that a2   200. then take the square root of each side to find that a   14.142. multiply this by 4  and you will find the perimeter of your square  p   56.57.   notice that you could have found the same thing by simply multiplying the radius  10  by 5.657. 10   5.567   56.57  but that might be hard to remember on a test  so it s better to memorize the process we used to get there.

truly appreciate your business   customers like to know they are appreciated  so recognizing their business can help you get a better tip.  customers will appreciate it if you acknowledge mistakes and apologize for them. do your best to fix the problem  and offer a discount or free item  if your employer allows it.    make sure the pizza was made correctly and that you have everything the customer ordered. they will be frustrated and less likely to tip you if you forgot those extra containers of ranch dressing  or brought them super spicy hot wings when they ordered barbeque flavor wings.  it s incredibly important that you get to your deliveries promptly. if your car battery is constantly dying  or you break down on the side of the road often  that will severely reduce your tips. make sure you have a reliable vehicle to do your deliveries with  because being late will not help you earn good money.  spend some time looking at a map  or even driving around to get a feel for the area. you need to know all of the major roads in your city  and what separates your city into northern  southern  eastern  and western sections. you ll make better time if you know the difference between 500 west maple and 500 east maple.  many people have gps or can get directions using their cell phone. if this doesn t apply to you  invest in a gps system for your car. it will be super helpful if you get lost or if a customer lives in the middle of nowhere. using gps can also help you find the most efficient route from one delivery to the next.  customers may ask questions about their order or future orders  so be sure you know the menu. they will appreciate you being able to tell them what s on the  super supreme  when they ask.  customers will need a pen to add a tip and sign the receipt if they paid with a credit card. not having a working pen with you tells the customer you are unprepared. be sure to keep a few spares in your car  and one in the delivery bag or in your pocket.  you ll get better tips if you look presentable. wear clothes without stains or rips  if possible  and make sure your hair is neat. some guys even say they get better tips when they are clean shaven  so you could consider getting rid of your beard if you re not too attached to it.  make an  x  or an arrow that points to all three lines on the receipt  total  tip  and signature . highlighting just the tip line is tacky  but pointing out all three may make a customer more likely to fill in that tip line rather than leave it blank.  rather than giving a five dollar bill back when someone hands you  20 and their total was  15  give them back five ones. this way  they ll be more likely to give you a couple bucks  rather than stuffing that  5 back in their pocket.  some people add a tip to the bill on a credit card at the time they order. though it may be tempting to leave this order for last  since you know you ve already bagged a tip  don t do that. give them the respect they deserve and deliver their pizza promptly. they ll remember your effort  and will be more likely to tip you well the next time  too.  some people order pizza often and may have tipped you well in the past. try to remember these customers  and treat them well. ask how they are doing  or suggest new menu items you think they may like. a little extra effort can go a long way to ensuring you always receive a good tip from these customers.  while you may not be able to offer discounts or give out free pizza or sodas  you can offer extra items. bring extra napkins  plates  or seasonings  such as red peppers or parmesan cheese. offering these to your customers when you arrive shows them that you are prepared and that you care about their order and experience.
query	177	make lager make lemon beer  there is a reason why many styles of mild wheat beer  such as german hefeweizens and belgian wits  are served with a lemon wedge in the glass. the bright  lively citrus notes pair excellently with the smooth  earthy flavor of wheat beer.    lemon also pairs excellently with light lager style beers like pilsner and pale american lagers. in fact  a popular summer cocktail called a shandy takes advantage of this very pairing by combining pale lager beer and lemonade.    while this combination is not as popular  you may also find that lemon works well with rich  flavorful beers like stout  porter  and ipa. lemon could provide an energetic lift to the heavy chocolate notes of a stout  while lemon might also blend harmoniously with the grapefruit notes of a hoppy ipa.    the most straightforward way to brew lemon beer is to add a small amount of lemon juice to the beer during secondary fermentation. some of the sugars in the lemon juice will undergo fermentation  which will add complexity to the beer. however  the basic brightness of the lemon will remain present in the beer s finished flavor.    an option for adding more subtle lemon flavor to your beer is to steep lemon peel in the secondary fermenter. the lemon peel contains the fruit s essential oils  which are very flavorful and will not be metabolized by the yeast. you can also steep complementary spices in the secondary fermenter  such as clove or cinnamon.    a third option for making lemon beer is to use a prepared product such as lemon jam. the flavor in these products is often more concentrated than in lemon juice  and it won t tend to dissipate so much between fermentation and consumption. note that the sugar present in jams and jellies will increase the gravity of your beer.    of course  a simple way to make sure the lemon tastes as fresh as possible in your beer is to add it to your glass just before drinking. adding a lemon wedge to your beer glass can be an easy way to improve its presentation or even to test a beer recipe for the possible addition of lemon during fermentation.   nan

query	182	play chess on internet  chess play chinese chess  the board itself has 64 squares  the same number of spaces as an international chess board. however  the chinese chess board has a river in the middle that divides the board between opposing players. it also has diagonal lines in some places that designate the boundaries that some pieces may not move beyond.no plays can be made in the river. pieces must cross it to make a play. on each side of the playing board  there is an imperial palace where the general and guard pieces are not allowed to leave.    chinese chess pieces are placed on line intersections  which are called points  instead of in the actual board squares. the board is made up of 9 by 10 points.on a chinese chess board  pieces may only move on the line intersections  much like in the game go.    these pieces are quite similar to the pieces in international chess. each player gets 1 general  king   2 guards  2 elephants  bishops   2 chariots  rooks   2 horses  knights   2 cannons and 5 soldiers  pawns . each piece is a flat white disk with either red or black markings that make up the chinese word that corresponds to the piece.   each piece has a designated place on the board  as in international chess. to play chinese chess  you need to make sure that your pieces are all in the correct place on the board. remember  the pieces go on the intersections  not on the squares.on the row nearest you  place your pieces on the points from left to right  the chariot  horse  elephant  guard  king  guard  elephant  knight and chariot. on the third row  place your two cannons on the intersection that is one space from the edge of the right and left side of the board. on the fourth row  place your soldier pieces on every other intersection  beginning with the first intersection on the edge of the board.    as in international chess  your goal is to capture the other player s general  king . you will need to use your other pieces to put your opponent s general into checkmate. in the process  you will try to capture as many of your opponent s pieces as possible to make it easier to put your opponent into checkmate.   each piece in chinese chess has a specific type of movement that it can make. it is essential to understand these rules for movement in order to play the game. the pieces  movement rules are as follows the general can move 1 space back or forward  right or left but cannot make a move diagonally. this piece is also not allowed to leave the imperial palace area. the general piece may capture any enemy piece which strays into the imperial palace area unless that piece is protected by another piece. generals on the opposite sides of the board cannot be across from each other without another piece between them. a chariot or rook piece can move any number of spaces in a straight line horizontally or vertically through the rows of the board. the horse piece is equivalent to the knight in international chess rules  in that it can move 1 point any direction and 1 point diagonally  aka 2 points in one direction and 1 point perpendicular to it . however  the horse cannot jump another piece  e.g. if there is a piece in front of the horse blocking it s path of 2 points forward . cannon move rules are the same as the chariot rook with one difference. in order to capture  the cannon has to jump over only 1 piece but it can be of either color. guards can move only 1 point diagonally in either direction but  they cannot leave the imperial palace. the elephant can move 2 points diagonally  as a bishop can in international chess. however an elephant cannot cross the river on the board. if there is a piece on the point which the elephant has to jump over in order to get to the second point then the elephant can t get to the second point.soldiers can only move and capture 1 point forward  not diagonally  until they cross the river. once they cross the river  soldiers can move 1 point to the left or right or forwards but not backwards.    the player with the red pieces always makes the first move  and then the next player goes. the players alternate turns throughout the entire game. players may only make one move each per turn. make sure that you consider the ways each piece is allowed to move before you make your moves.to  capture  is to take over the point that the opposing team occupies. it s the same strategic move that s used in international chess. you put your opponent s general in  check  if your next move will capture the piece. your opponent s next move has to be to protect the general from capture.    you and your opponent must move and capture each other s pieces until one of you checkmates the other or neither of you can checkmate the other. in a stalemate situation  the game is considered a draw.a  checkmate  occurs when the general cannot escape capture. you can also win if you force your opponent into a  stalemate   in which your opponent cannot make a legal move to protect his general. the game is a draw when neither player can force a stalemate or checkmate.

query	187	drink diet coke make a diet coke and mentos rocket  for the purposes of this example  we re using diet coke  but you can actually use any type of diet soda  as long as it contains aspartame .   warm soda causes better explosions  so avoid using cold refrigerated soda.for best results  purchase room temperature soda and then let it sit outside in the sun or in a pot full of hot  not boiling  water for a few hours before using it.    experiments have shown that while the original mint mentos will give you a longer explosion  mentos fruit will give you slightly shorter but more intense explosion.other experiments have shown that mint mentos are the better choice because the gum arabic found in the mint coating reduces surface tension and quickens the carbon dioxide s escape from the bottle  making for a more intense explosion.as the rocket is more of a fast acting affair  you might want to go for mint mentos. if you have the time and money to do so  why not try one bottle with mint mentos and one with fruit mentos  and then compare the results     you probably have this one lying around your house already  but if you don t  you should be able to buy a roll just about anywhere  hardware stores are a safe bet .    wearing goggles will not only protect your eyes from the soda mentos concoction  but also from any other debris  for example  the lid  that might fly out from the bottle once it hits the ground and explodes.    your rocket is likely to bounce around like crazy  make sure it has enough room to do that. if you re in a parking lot  make sure there are no cars nearby for at least a 50 foot radius  if not more.   if there s a field or empty lot nearby  go there to make your rocket. you don t want to risk doing damage to anyone s car or home  as it could cost you or your parents a lot of money to repair.    it s possible you ll get covered in the sticky diet coke mentos solution. wear clothes and shoes that you don t mind getting wet and sticky   preferably ones that are easy to wash.    bring your 2 liter bottle of diet coke  your pack of mentos  your masking tape  and your safety goggles to wherever you ve decided to build your rocket.    place the strips of tape on a flat surface  with their sticky sides facing up. do not allow them to stick together.    the more mentos you use  the better the explosion  however  you don t want to the mentos to dip too far into the diet coke otherwise the explosion may begin before you can screw the lid on the bottle.    they should look just as they did when they were still in their original packaging  stacked on top of one another like a roll of coins.    be sure to leave the sides of the mentos exposed.    you ll use this piece to attach the mentos to the bottle cap  so ensure that it s small enough to fit inside the cap.    take the 3 inch strip of sticky rolled tape that you ve just created and attach it to the top of the taped roll of mentos. this will create a  loaded  mentos cartridge that you can place inside the diet coke bottle.    put the cap on a flat surface  with its inside facing upwards. place the mentos cartridge  sticky tape side up  into the soda cap and press down to fasten it there.   be careful not to press too hard  as you don t want any mentos falling out of the cartridge     this step is optional. if you re worried about the mentos prematurely falling into the diet coke  you can secure the cartridge by running one more piece of masking tape around the entire roll  including the cap.    the cap should be securely on the bottle  but not closed too tightly. if it s closed too tightly  the cap might not come off when you throw the bottle  and the rocket won t work. as you twist the cap on  you ll also want to make sure that the mentos do not touch the diet coke yet.  if it seems like the mentos will touch the diet coke  you can either dump a small amount of diet coke out before screwing the cap on  redo your mentos cartridge to contain fewer mentos  or you can try your luck and screw the cap on as quickly as possible.    shake it so that the mentos fall into the diet coke  and then keep shaking. do this for at least a few seconds.    there are several different methods for  launching  your rocket    a popular and effective one is to throw the bottle high up into the air and let it fall on to the ground  preferably hard ground  like cement . this is the best method if you re worried about getting hit by the rocket  as you can throw it far away from you and even run in the opposite direction. another method is to throw the bottle at a side angle so that when it hits the ground  the ground knocks off its cap. yet another method is to throw the bottle at more of a 90 degree angle  cap first  on to the ground.    you can skip this step if your rocket works right away. if the rocket doesn t go off when you throw it  pick it up and try unscrewing the cap a little before throwing it again. just be careful not to unscrew the cap too far  otherwise you re likely to end up covered in diet coke.  when the bottle hits the ground  its cap should fly off and the diet coke mentos solution will shoot out of the bottle s opening. this should cause the bottle to fly high up into the air. depending on how you throw it  the bottle might also bounce around sporadically for several seconds.   side angle launches generally seem to cause the bottle to bounce low and skid along the ground. vertical launches  in which you throw the bottle straight up into the air and let it fall to the ground  tend to give the rocket more height as it shoots upward. if the bottle is still full of diet coke and mentos but it s stopped moving on the ground  you can try to launch it again to see if it has any more flight left in it.    once you ve finished your experiment  don t forget to pick up after yourself. clean up any bits of tape or mentos packaging that might have dropped to the ground as you built your rocket. and pick up the rocket  clean out the bottle and put it in the recycling bin  or bring it to the bottle depot .    the more mentos  the better the explosion. experiment with putting different amounts of mentos into the diet coke bottle to see what yields the best explosion.    studies have shown that mint and fruit mentos yield different explosions. try mixing them together in one cartridge and adding them to your diet coke bottle to see what sort of explosion they cause when they are mixed together.    fill an empty 4 liter milk jug with 4 liters  2 two liter bottles  of diet coke. leave enough room at the top to add at least an 8 mento cartridge.   as with the original rocket recipe  stick the mentos cartridge to the lid of the milk jug  fasten the lid  shake the container to release the mentos into the diet coke  then throw the jug high up into the air and let it hit the pavement hard.    get together with your friends and each make your own rocket. set up a flag or some other way of measuring height  and have a judge watch and name the winner.  
query	188	drink diet soda if have diabetes diet drink drink alcohol on a diet  pure spirits  also known as liquors  typically have fewer calories and carbs than any other alcoholic drinks  as well as less sugar. if you have the palate for neat whiskey or a scotch and soda  make something like that your go to drink.if you re on a low carb diet  stick to whiskey  brandy or tequila   all of which have zero carbs. whiskey  vodka  and rum each have only 64 calories per shot  compared with more than a hundred calories per serving of beer.spirits also have higher alcohol content per volume than beer or wine  which means that you ll drink far fewer calories.    if you don t care for the taste of straight liquor  it s okay to have a mixed drink while you re on a diet. however  you need to pay attention to the drink s recipe so you know what goes into it  and avoid sugary mixers.serious cocktails such as long island iced teas not only have several shots of alcohol  but also pack a lot of sugar and calories. however  even a simple drink such as a rum and coke can still derail your diet   not with the rum  but with the mixer. even a drink such as a gin and tonic  which isn t really a sweet tasting drink at all  carries 16 grams of sugar. one or two of those could potentially bury your diet. if you need to dilute the taste of the spirits with something  try cub soda  which has no sugar or calories. when making mixed drinks at home  avoid bottled  pre made mixers  which typically are high in calories and sugar  although there are some  diet  versions available . the worst possible drinks   whether alone or mixed with something else   are cream based liqueurs  such as irish cream  along with other cream based mixed drinks such as amaretto sours  or mudslides  which weigh in at 820 calories .  apart from typically having more calories and sugar  the alcohol in bubbly drinks is absorbed faster than in drinks without carbonation.while faster absorption alone may not impact your diet directly  it can destroy your diet indirectly because the alcohol you drink will effect you more quickly. this means you could potentially feel a heavy buzz after one or two glasses of champagne  lowering your inhibitions and making you feel hungry   even if you just ate. carbonated drinks also can cause bloating and fluid retention  which can lead to dehydration.this is the reason you may have heard of the  beer belly    drinking beer and other carbonated alcoholic beverages can result in greater fat deposits around your midsection.    generally speaking  the sweeter a wine is  the worse it will be for your diet. while red wine is relatively low in calories and sugar  white wine can include significant amounts of sugar and carbohydrates.wine has antioxidants and other nutrients that actually can improve your health if drunk in moderation. after all  wine is made of fermented grapes  which in and of themselves can be a healthy diet snack. choose a dry wine for fewer carbs. you typically can have a glass or two of dry red wine on a regular basis on even the strictest low carb diet.  generally speaking  beer is your worst enemy if you re on a diet. it s carbonated  high in carbohydrates  and high in calories. if you drink a wheat beer  you re essentially drinking fermented liquid bread.many larger beer companies have introduced light and low carb brews to their lineup  but you may not find these appealing   particularly if you love the taste of regular beer. if you are going to have a beer  go for a darker beer  such as a stout  which has about 170 calories per pint. lighter beers average around 195 calories per pint  but can have even more.the other advantage of darker beers is that they are heavier  and will make you feel more full. they also typically have a slightly higher alcohol content than lighter beers.    getting drunk can negatively affect more than just your diet. especially if you re out on the town  set yourself a hard limit of one  maybe two drinks   depending on how long you re out.one drink a day is considered moderate drinking. if you only drink once or twice a drink  you probably can get away with having two drinks. but more than that  and you re at serious risk of blowing your diet. generally speaking  one drink per hour is a good pace. however  this doesn t mean if you re out with your friends for four hours owning bar trivia  that means you can have four drinks. even if you haven t had a drink all week  having more than two drinks in a night can seriously damage your health and put all the benefits you re getting from your diet at risk. keep in mind that your diet is about your health  not your budget. your limit doesn t mean  only two drinks unless someone else is paying.  it means two drinks  period.    when you re counting your drinks  keep in mind that the drinks you get from a bar or restaurant typically will be larger   sometimes significantly larger   than the drink you would make at home.before you go out   or when making drinks at home   it s important to know what constitutes a  drink.  you may have a 32 ounce stein  but filling it full of beer doesn t mean you ve only had one beer. a  drink   for the purposes of measuring alcohol  is defined as one serving of alcohol. this translates to a 12 ounce bottle of beer  5 ounces of wine  or a single shot of liquor. however  restaurants and bars may give you a pint of beer  that s 4 ounces over a single serving   or mixed drinks with multiple shots. keep serving sizes   not drink sizes   in mind when you re ordering at a bar or restaurant. for example  if you ve limited yourself to two drinks  and you order a double  that s your limit. two shots of liquor is equal to two servings of alcohol.    with every alcoholic drink you consume  you should be drinking at least 12 ounces of water. if you re out at a bar or restaurant  order ice water along with your drink and take two sips of your water for every sip you have of your drink.you also should drink at least one big glass of water before you go out  or before you start drinking. alcohol has a dehydrating effect  so you want to make sure you re well hydrated before you even start drinking  then maintain your hydration level by balancing your alcohol intake with water intake. when you get back home  have another big glass of water or two before you go to bed.    munching on something with fiber  healthy fat  and protein will give you long lasting energy that can counter alcohol s tendency to raise your blood sugar.if you don t have a full meal  you should at least have a snack  such as greek yogurt with berries  a handful of almonds  or an apple. keep in mind that the alcohol in your drinks won t be absorbed as quickly if you drink on a full stomach. this can keep you from trashing your diet once a buzz kicks in. if you re going out for dinner  pull up the restaurant s menu online before you go out so you have time to study it and make a healthy choice that won t blow your diet.    once you have a few drinks  greasy fries  nachos  or mozzarella sticks might start sounding like just the thing you need. however  if you abandon your diet to that extent after a few drinks  you ll end up regretting it.while greasy food can help settle the stomach a little if you ve had one too many  you may pay for it in the morning   especially if you ve maintained a healthy diet of whole foods for weeks or months. your body isn t used to that kind of food  and may reject it. the other side of that is your body will end up storing as fat anything it doesn t recognize as food. if you go for greasy fried food after a night drinking  chances are most of it will end up around your midsection. many bars also have plentiful snacks hanging around  such as peanuts or pretzels. move them far enough away from you that they aren t within arm s length  or sit with your back to them. if you re out with friends and someone orders appetizers for the table  keep them out of your line of sight so you won t be tempted to take some.    when you re drinking  you tend to get hungry. keeping healthy snacks out if you re drinking at home means you ll be more inclined to reach for those than to start hunting for junk.almonds are a good go to snack to have around  and you can just leave a bowl of them on the table. edamame also can make a good snack with various alcoholic drinks   especially japanese sake. if you tend to crave something salty when you drink  try organic tortilla chips with a simple avocado dip. you also can make a dip by mashing edamame.    if you re going out with friends  get your food together before you leave so that when you come home you ll have a healthy  filling snack ready to go and won t raid your fridge.before going to bed  choose a calming  high fiber snack to get back some nutrients your body lost while you were out drinking. hot cereal or oatmeal are good choices. since foods with plenty of fiber take longer to digest  you won t go to bed hungry  nor will you wake up famished in the morning.

follows connect the computer that is sharing the connection  the  host   to the broadband modem via ethernet or 4g hotspot via usb. if you are connecting a modem to the host computer via ethernet  it will need two ethernet ports  one to connect to the modem  and the other to connect to the hub or router . connect the host computer to the wan port of a wired hub or wireless router using an ethernet cable. connect the other computers to the hub or router using ethernet or a wireless signal. note that the connecting computers don t need any special settings  and can be running any operating system. if you re just connecting two computers  connect them directly via ethernet.    you can quickly open this window by pressing the windows key   r and typing ncpa.cpl.    this could be your modem or your usb hotspot. make sure that you are only performing these steps on the adapter that is actually connected to the internet  not the adapter that will be connecting the host to the rest of the network.   nan  click apply to save your changes.   at this point  you can turn your host computer into a wireless access point if you have an unused wireless adapter. click here for instructions.    this is important if the other computers need to access email  ftp  or other special services. check the box for each service that you want to enable.    now that the host computer is set up  you ll need to configure the router to allow it to pass the connection through. click here for detailed instructions on opening the router s configuration page.   if you re using a hub or switch  you won t need to perform any additional configuration.    the exact wording will vary from model to model.    again  the wording will vary slightly depending on your exact router.    your host and router have been configured  and now it s time to connect your other devices.   if connecting via ethernet  connect each additional computer to the lan ports on the router or hub. if connecting wirelessly  connect to the router as if you were connecting to any wireless network.    this is typically the case if you only have one network adapter installed. you must have at least two different network adapters installed to use internet connection sharing.    this is typically caused by the computer not getting a correct ip address.   make sure that you only have internet connection sharing enabled on the host computer  and only on the adapter that s connected to the internet. all of the other computers on the network should not have internet connection sharing enabled. open the network connections window on the computer that cannot get an internet connection.  the windows key   r and then type ncpa.cpl . right click on the network adapter and select properties. select  internet

startup type  to  automatic . reboot the computer after setting each service and try the connection again.    this method will allow you to use an unused wireless adapter on your windows host computer to broadcast a wireless network that any other device can connect to  just like a wireless router. first  you ll need to enable internet connection sharing on the host computer by following steps 1 5 of the first section.   the host computer will need to have a wireless adapter that isn t being used in order to broadcast a signal for other computers and devices to connect to. if the host computer doesn t have a wireless card installed  you can use a usb wireless adapter. make sure you only enable internet connection sharing on the adapter that s connected to the internet. don t enable internet sharing on the wireless adapter that you ll be using to create the wireless network.    this will open a new window with your active network connections.    this link can be found towards the bottom of the network and sharing center window.    if you are using windows 8  you will need to download a free program like virtual router  virtualrouter.codeplex.com  which accomplishes the same thing.  give the network a name and select  wpa2 personal  as the security type. make sure that the security key cannot be easily guessed.   make sure to check the  save this network  box  or you ll need to reconfigure it every time you reboot the computer.    with the wireless network created and internet connection sharing enabled  you should now be able to connect any of your other computers or mobile devices to the wireless network just like any other wireless network. enter in the security key you created in the previous step to connect.    some older devices cannot properly connect to an ad hoc network  and the problem can get even worse if they don t support wpa 2. if you absolutely have to have that device on the network  try lowering the ad hoc network s security to wep.    os x s sharing menu allows you to easily share your mac s internet connection using any of your installed network adapters. the computer sharing the network is called the  host  computer. you will need at least two network adapters installed in the host to share your connection  one to connect to the internet  and one to connect to the rest of your network.if you have an unused wireless adapter  for example  your host is connected to the modem via ethernet   you can use it to create a wireless network that other devices can connect to in order to access the internet. if you have two ethernet adapters  you can connect one to the modem  and the other to a network switch or router. your other computers and devices can then connect to this network.    for the best results  it s recommended that you connect the host computer directly to your broadband modem via ethernet  or use a usb hotspot. if your mac doesn t have an ethernet port  you can use a usb or thunderbolt adapter.  click the apple menu and select  system preferences .    this will open the sharing window.    this will enable sharing for the host computer s internet connection.    if you re connected to your modem via ethernet  select it from the menu. if you re connected to a usb hotspot  select it instead.   click start to confirm that you want to enable internet sharing. note that turning internet connection sharing on will likely disrupt any existing network you have set up.    the method you choose depends on the way you want other computers to connect.   if you want to turn your mac into a wireless hotspot  check the  wi fi  box. if you want to connect your mac to a network hub or wireless router  select  ethernet .    if you opted to share your host s internet connection with a hub or router which the other computers will connect to  use an ethernet cable and connect your host to the hub s wan port.  if you decided to turn your mac into a wireless access point  click the wi fi options... to set a name and security key for the network. make sure to select  wpa2 personal  as the  security  type  and create a password that won t be easily guessed.if you re in a crowded living area such as an apartment complex  change the  channel  to something other than 6 or 11  as these are the two most common ones. doing so will help reduce interference.    your host mac is now ready to share its internet connection  and you can connect the other computers and devices as if it was a typical network.  if connecting via ethernet  connect each additional computer to the lan ports on the router or hub. they should automatically get ip addressed and be able to connect to the internet. if connecting wirelessly  connect to the router as if you were connecting to any wireless network.    this will often occur if you ve made changes to the sharing settings after enabling the wireless network. the quickest way to try to fix this problem is by disabling internet sharing  restarting the mac  and then re enabling it and creating a new wireless network.

query	191	play french horn play the french horn  as with any instrument  there s a proper way to hold your french horn to get the best sound possible when you play it.   sit up in a chair with your back straight so that you can breathe into the horn without obstruction. put your feet flat on the floor  parallel to each other. hold the horn at a 45 degree angle with the mouthpiece toward your face. cup your hand and place your left thumb on the thumb key. put your left index  middle  and ring fingers on the three keys on top. your left pinkie should be through pinkie ring  and your right hand inside of the bell. now that your fingers are in place  bring the horn up so that the mouthpiece is against your lips.    to blow into the mouthpiece  you have to first learn how to purse your lips. this is called   embouchure.    practice saying   mmmm  with your mouth  slowly adding pressure between your lips. your lips should form a frown. the corners of your mouth should stay in place  almost as if you re puckering your lips.it s a good idea to practice in front of a mirror to make sure you re getting your form right.  without pressing any of the valves  you can use the embouchure technique to blow into the mouthpiece of the horn.   you want to blow into the horn using fast  quick blows.make sure you re not pressing your mouth into the mouthpiece too hard. if your teeth hurt or a ring appears on your lips  you re pressing too hard. you want a relaxed tension against the mouthpiece when you blow into it.  it will make your life a lot easier to learn exactly where the keys are so that your fingers know where to go when you re playing.   through repeated playing muscle memory builds  so your fingers know where the keys are. practices pressing the keys  knowing which keys you re pressing. do this until you can pass a test of accuracy.it can help to have a fingering chart while you practice.  the volume of the notes you play will depend on how much air you blow into the horn  and how fast. the more air you blow  and the faster you blow it  the louder the note will sound  and vice versa .  to be a good french horn player you ll want to learn how to read music.   sheet music is the basis of many musical performances. you can also learn by ear  but most songs are played from sheet music. learning sheet music gives you a deeper understanding of how your instrument works  as well as music theory.  the most basic thing you ll learn first is the order of the notes and how they re placed on a music staff.many parts go into the relationship between notes and the staff. that s why this piece is so fundamental.    once you ve memorized the notes  the next step is to understand how the clefs work.there are two clefs that can show up on a music staff. the treble clef notates the higher pitches of music  and the bass clef notates the lower pitches.    sheet music notates how fast or slow a song is by the tempo. it s usually notated at the top of the sheet using a bpm  beats per minute  measurement.  once you have a pretty good understanding of the basics of sheet music  try playing a simple melody. pick something that only has a few notes and practice until you ve mastered it.    eventually  you can practice playing more complex melodies. this will help you play your instrument better and help you become better at reading sheet music.   pick music that has a variety of note structures  clefs  and tempos.    now that you can hold your instrument and play sitting down  it s time to play standing up. a french horn weighs about 4 pounds. there won t be many times when you ll need to play standing up  but recitals are a common one.since your right hand is in the bell anyway  just slide it up to the top of the bell so that it s resting on your hand. all your other hand placements stay the same. you can buy small modification pieces that help hold up the horn easier.    once you ve mastered the basics you re ready to learn more advanced playing techniques. it can be helpful to recruit a tutor or advanced player for these skills.   muting  or stopping  the horn creates a high pitched sound from the bell. you can stop the horn by moving your hand further into the bell until it s in all the way. twist it until little or no air can get out.slurring notes are playing two notes without stopping or releasing between. to do this you ll continue to change the notes on your keys but your airflow remains constant and steady.playing glissando is starting and ending on specific notes while playing as many notes between as you can.  lessons are a great way to learn advanced skills and get feedback on your progress. you can hire private tutors or join group classes. some classes will play at events  giving you an opportunity to show off your new chops.    you can find a lot of useful tutorial videos online. some of them will teach you to play using sheet music  and some will teach you to play by ear. if you search  you should find what you re looking for.    the most effective way to become a better horn player is to practice. make time to play your horn on a regular basis. create challenges for yourself by upping the ante on songs you play.   you can get books of sheet music that have a variety of songs with different levels of difficulty. tutor books sometimes include training schedules  often with lessons on reading sheet music.  don t be afraid to ask questions when you get stuck or aren t sure how to do something. there are lots of places you can go to get your questions answered.   you can consult tutors  french horn websites  video comment threads  and forums.    when you re not playing your horn  store it in a padded case. most cases have a hard shell to protect it from damage.    each time you play your horn you should clean it. this will prolong the life of the instrument.   polish it using a polishing cloth. if it s dirty  you can apply polishing gauze with a cloth.let the interior of the instrument dry. remove the valve slides and dry those while the rest of the body is drying.  every week or two you ll want to conduct routine maintenance on your instrument to make sure it stays in good condition for as long as possible.   clean the mouthpiece with dish soap and water. it might also be helpful to use a mouthpiece brush  which you can find at most music stores.oil the rotors

query	195	use hair dryer dry curly hair  curly hair is often more dry than straight hair because the natural oils produced at the scalp have a hard time maneuvering their way through the twists of curly hair. the result is that these natural oils aren t distributed throughout the hair  especially at the ends. this causes hair to be dry  and then break and become frizzy. if you wash your curly hair every day  use a moisturizing shampoo that will hydrate it to prevent it from breaking  and to reduce frizz  split ends and add shine.choose a shampoo that s either sulfate free or doesn t contain ammonium lauryl sulfate  ammonium laureth sulfate or sodium lauryl sulfate. these are essentially powerful detergents that strip your hair and scalp of the natural oils your hair needs.try to stay away from all products that contain alcohol  which sucks up hair s moisture and gives curls that crunchy look and feel.    hair needs a balance of both moisture and protein to have elasticity. this means it stretches without breaking  and it is the primary indicator of your hair s health.protein conditioners not only penetrate the hair shaft to make it stronger  but they also form a film on the hair cuticles  or the outer layer of the hair  so they lay flat. this helps reduce frizz.use a protein conditioner containing wheat  keratin  silk  milk  collagen or soy or a moisturizing conditioner containing jojoba oil  glycerin  or vegetable glycerin   aloe vera  shea butter or vitamin e.you can alternate between the two daily  every few days or weekly. you may even use one more often than the other depending upon your hair s texture and how often you use heat to style it. use a protein conditioner more often if your hair feels dry and frizzy  stretches a great deal but still breaks  feels limp when wet or if it doesn t hold its curl or style very well. use a moisturizing conditioner more often if your hair breaks or snaps very easily  feels brittle or straw like  or doesn t stretch much or at all.  the  co washing  movement calls for primarily skipping shampoo because it strips away natural oils over time. instead it recommends using a gentle cleansing conditioner.choose a conditioner that is designed for co washing or that says it s a cleansing conditioner. they often will label themselves as such and contain natural ingredients like aloe vera. avoid any with silicones because they will weigh down hair.wash hair with a cleansing conditioner every 3 7 days depending upon your hair type. wash less often the curlier and more coarse it is.use more than you normally would  massaging it in from root to end  and let it absorb for 3 5 minutes before rinsing.wash your hair with a sulfate free  clarifying shampoo every 2 4 weeks because cleaning conditioners do cause build up.co washing is not recommended for those with fine hair because it will weigh thin hair down and make it too oily.if you don t know your curl type  go to sites like this to find out  .    never rub your hair with a towel to get it drier. towel drying your hair vigorously creates friction  causing your hair cuticles to roughen up. you want them to lay flat and smooth to reduce frizz. instead  gently squeeze dripping water from your hair using your hands. next use a towel or micro fiber  super absorbent cloth to soak up more water by first squeezing and then patting downward.t shirts are a great alternative for curly hair because they re smooth and don t roughen up the hair s cuticles.  air drying allows hair more time to absorb moisture from the air and swell. this makes it more apt to break and the cuticle to become rough and cause frizz. leave in conditioners contain polymers that form a barrier or film on the hair strand  blocking humidity and reducing frizz.comb the leave in conditioner through your hair with a wide toothed comb.  using a brush to tug through your hair after you wash it is very damaging.  focus on the mid shaft  or the middle of the length of your hair  to the ends. here are some detangling tips to make the process less damaging.   divide your hair into 4 8 sections and pin each up with bobby pins  flat pin curl clips or crocodile clips. release one section at a time and use either your fingers or a wide toothed comb to gently rake through your hair  starting at the ends and working up toward your roots. if you encounter a particularly troublesome knot  put some conditioner on your fingers to work it out. once you have detangled a section of hair  give it a twist and pin it back up before moving on to another. when each is done  take all pins and clips out of your hair. if your hair is very thick  very curly or you have masses of curls  use a comb with long teeth that s able to penetrate your hair.  air drying your hair doesn t mean only letting it air dry.using products make a big difference when you re styling without heat. you should apply an anti frizz and or curling serum  oil  cream  gel  mousse  lotion or spray before your hair gets too dry to control frizz and to define and control hold your curls. the type s  you choose depends upon the texture of your hair  your curl type and how you want your curls to look. you may find that a combination of two or more works best.serums  oils  lotions and creams are generally used to smooth. gels and thicker creams are used most often to help control hold or to define shape. mousses and foams add volume and also help define shape. sprays can do many of these things  in addition to add texture. reading reviews online is a great way to help select products.    use a comb or your fingers to form your natural part. find your natural part by combing hair back and then shaking your head. this will cause it part naturally. then move your fingers in a zigzag motion at your scalp to lift your hair away from the roots. this will give it lift and air circulation to dry more quickly.next use your hands to either scrunch your hair or twist it  depending upon your curl type and the look you desire.   when scrunching  either stand straight or flip your head first to one side  to the other and then forward. either way  place your hand under the end of your hair  one section at a time  and scrunch upward toward the root a few times. then move to another section. when twisting  use your fingers to hook onto 1 3  sections of hair and twist it around your finger  moving from the bottom up  and hold for 15 30 seconds. they should be pretty well defined. if not  add a bit more product to your hair.as your hair dries  don t touch it  running your hands through your hair only breaks up the curls and creates flyaways and frizzy pieces of hair.  one of the benefits of using heat to dry your hair is that it helps lift roots to provide volume  especially at the top of your head. here are some tricks to add volume that involve parting your hair and pinning it in different ways as it air dries.   part your hair to the side you normally wouldn t and then flip it back just before it s dry. create a deeper side part on the side you normally part your hair and then flip it down just before your hair is dry. make a zigzag part  and use your fingers to part along your natural part just before your hair dries. or you can make a zigzag part after your hair dries. take flat pin curl clips  which won t leave lines or marks in your hair  and clip them at the roots on the top of your head and along your part line. remove them when your hair is dry.use claw clips to secure rows of hair. grab two  roughly 1 2  sections of hair near your forehead  one on each side of your part   crisscross them and secure it with a small claw clip. make 2 4 more rows behind  or going away from your forehead.  let your hair fully dry  and then remove any clips. use your fingers to separate your curls unless they ve dried in the style you prefer. if separating  use only one or two fingers to gently loosen each curl. you can loosen them more a second time  however  over loosening isn t an easy fix. finish with a styling product such as these.   spritz or spray a medium hold flexible or medium hold humidity resistant hairspray all over your hair. hold the can about 12  from your head. keep your hand moving the whole time  and use the smallest amount needed.for a textured or piece y finish  rub a penny sized amount of pomade between your palms. use your fingers to apply it from the mid shaft to the ends.use thicker  water soluble gels  or those with guar gum  that don t feel sticky to help tame and control medium to big curls. use denser creams for tight curls.you can also finish your hair with an anti frizz or smoothing serum or a natural treatment oil like argan  coconut  avocado  sweet almond or grape seed. use only a dab and rub it between your palms before either a  applying it to areas that are frizzy or need more control or b  to the ends using a twisting motion. avoid products with silicones unless they are water soluble or more gentle on the hair. more gentle silicones are amodimethicone  cyclomethicone cyclopentasiloxane and trimethyl silylamodi methicone. silicones that are more water soluble include behenoxy dimethicone and stearoxy dimethicone.  all use of heat on hair is damaging in some way  particularly so for curly hair that already tends to be dry and more prone to breaking. in fact  excessive heat changes the proteins in hair that creates the signature spiral shape of curly hair.so use a blow dryer that s no more than 1300 1874 watts  1400 watts is all you really need  with a cool shot button and multiple heat and speed settings.if you plan to dry your curly hair frequently  get a ceramic  ceramic ionic or ceramic tourmaline blow dryer. all reduce damage by either emitting infrared heat or using negative ions to break down water molecules.  some blow dryers come with diffusers  others do not. yet they are crucial for blow drying curly hair because they help evenly distribute heat  create volume in heavy curls  minimize frizz  and help keep curls intact. the normal nozzle on a blow dryer blows hair everywhere  which only distorts curl patterns and creates frizz. diffusers also enhance curls for hair that s less wavy.   choose a diffuser that s concave in the center  or not flat  so curls can rest inside it and take shape naturally.or buy one that has a cup like shape in which curls can nestle. also look for a diffuser that s about 2  3  wide for better heat distribution and that has at least 1 2  long  fingers  to help separate curls. they need to be long enough to reach roots for lift and volume.while many diffusers claim to fit all hair dryers  online reviewers say this isn t always the case. you may have to go by trial and error. you also might buy a blow dryer that comes with a diffuser  buy a diffuser that comes with a ring or strap to help secure it to your blow dryer  or go to your blow dryer company s product website and see if it recommends particular diffusers for your dryer model.    after you ve washed your hair  use a wide toothed comb to distribute either a moisturizing or protein conditioner through your hair. unless you are co washing  alternating between the two on a daily or weekly basis will help to maintain the proper balance of moisture and protein hair needs for strength and elasticity. let it absorb into your hair for a few minutes before rinsing. then rinse your hair again with cool water to seal the cuticles.   afterward  use your hands to gently squeeze excess water from your hair. next squeeze your hair with a t shirt  soft towel or super absorbent  micro fiber cloth to soak up more water before patting downward to help cuticles lay flat.    divide your hair into sections  and use a wide toothed comb to detangle your hair. after you have detangled a section  twist it and pin it up with a clip. once done  remove all clips.   you can apply the product to each section of hair as you detangle. or you can apply it afterward.    though you ll be drying your hair on low to medium heat  any heat is damaging to hair. thermal protectants form a protective barrier around each hair stand to reduce damage to hair cuticles. they also cut down on drying out the hair shaft more than necessary. some are silicone based and offer the most protection  but these also create the most build up and often weigh down hair. others are water based and oil based. avoid the latter should if your hair gets greasy quickly.after you comb it through your hair  create your part  hold the ends of your hair with your hands  shake them side to side  and then let go so your curls bounce back up.  there are a few ways to do this  and much of it depends upon the length and thickness of your hair and how much volume you want to create. for starters  though  always work in sections  you can use clips if that helps . also blow dry on low to medium heat so you don t burn your scalp and use a low to medium air speed setting to reduce frizz. additionally  only dry your hair 80 95  if it s curly  not wavy  before letting it air dry the rest of the way. do the ends last or not at all. both of these measures will reduce damage and frizz.one way to dry with a diffuser is to hold the blow dryer at a 90  angle from your head and place the diffuser at the roots of one section of hair. start at the nape of your neck and gently hold the ends away from the blow dryer. turn on the blow dryer and use the fingers of the diffuser to lift hair at the roots. move in a circular direction at the same time.another way  one that will add more volume  is to flip your head upside down and place the diffuser at the roots of your hair. use the diffuser s fingers to lift the roots in a circular direction. then use the diffuser to scrunch up the mid shaft to hold and dry. with this method  you want the roots and mid shaft to dry completely to lock in volume.another option is to tilt your head to one side and use your hand to cup up one section of hair from the mid shaft to the root. place the diffuser at the roots and hold the dryer at a 90  angle.then turn on the blow dryer and dry for a couple of minutes before turning it off to move to another section. tilt your head the opposite direction to do the other side  then start at your crown and move down. at the end  go back through using the dryer s cool shot button to set it.finally  if your hair is wavy and you re trying to add more curl  place your ends in the cup of the diffuser one section at a time. push it to your scalp and hold until dry.some also find it beneficial to let their hair air dry for 20 30 minutes  or until it s about 50  dry  to allow its natural curl pattern to better form. if you re trying to enhance curl  however  you should begin drying immediately.    once your hair is dry  you want to set it. spritz or spray a medium hold flexible or humidity resistant hairspray in a continuous motion over your hair. you can also use a pomade  especially if your hair feels a bit crunchy  by smoothing it over  not through  your curls. or you can finish with a drop of serum or a naturally based oil. smooth it over frizzy spots or apply it to the ends with a twist.  drying mid to long curly hair with heat will typically take 30 minutes  if not much longer. if you don t have this time  the best choice in many cases is to set and wrap your hair before you go to sleep. while your hair is still damp  not wet or dry  wind 1 2  sections toward your scalp and secure each with bobby pins. then wrap your hair in a silk scarf to reduce flyaways. when you get up  use your fingers or a wide toothed comb to unravel your curls and style.   if your hair is particularly curly  you can also twist or braid your hair before wrapping it.  the idea behind plopping is that it not only reduces how long it takes your hair to dry but it also helps create a more polished curly look. because your curls will stack on top of each other through plopping  they will have more spring and shape  and you ll get more volume at your roots. wash  condition and apply an anti frizz or curling product to your hair first. then follow these steps.   lay a large t shirt on a flat surface with the short sleeves closest to you. bend over and place your head in the center so your hair is lying above it on the t shirt  and fold the end of the t shirt over your hair and top of your head. grab the sleeves and twist inward toward your ears. tie it  or secure with a clip  loosely at the base of your neck. leave it on for about 15 30 minutes and allow your hair to air dry the rest of the way.  a bonnet dryer is a plastic cap that you wrap around your hair to dry it. it s a more gentle method of drying hair than using a blow dryer  though it takes longer. nonetheless  it will also speed up your total drying time if you don t want to use a blow dryer because of its damaging effects.hooded dryers are another less damaging alternative.they aren t as expensive as you might think  however  make sure you get one that is large enough to accommodate your head in rollers.   both are hands free  too  which is an advantage.    a doobie wrap   or simply doobie   is a dominican technique for wrapping and pinning hair to straighten it. start with your hair wet. part it in the middle and begin on one side by combing 1 3  sections of hair straight. pull and smooth each section with the comb around your head. secure it with a long bobby pin at the crown of your head  the nape of your neck and the end point. move to the other half of your hair and do the same  combing it on top of the hair that s already pinned.   wrap a silk scarf around your hair if you re going to sleep.otherwise  let it air dry  or use a bonnet dryer or a hooded dryer.  start by applying a setting lotion to your hair. this will help straighten it and make the straightening last longer. use a wide toothed comb to part your hair into sections  and roll 2 4  sections of hair onto 2 4  metal or mesh rollers. pull tight at the scalp because this is the area that s most resistant to straightening. secure each roller at the scalp with a large clip. make sure you roll backward  away from the face.   allow your hair to dry naturally  or use a bonnet dryer or hooded dryer on a low heat before switching to cool to set your curls. you can also combine air drying with either dryer by letting your hair air dry for awhile before using one of the dryers. or you can dry it partially with one of the dryers and then let it air dry the rest of the way. test to see if it s dry by unrolling one roller at the back of your head after about 45 minutes  longer if your hair is very thick or coarse.   first  don t turn on the vent before you shower. after you ve washed and conditioned your hair  stay in the shower or the bathroom and let your hair soak in the steam. this will help enhance your curls. then apply a curling or anti frizz serum  lotion  cream  oil  etc. to your hair while it s still quite wet.    there are a number on the market  so reading reviews online is a good place to start if you don t already use one. you don t want to use too much of any product because it will weigh down hair  and your curls won t last as long. using a moisturizing conditioner and not rinsing it out enhances and holds curls unless your hair is fine or wavy. applying mousse and then scrunching works very well for hair that is less curly. it can also help shape and define curls as well.use roughly a nickel  to a quarter sized amount of anti frizz serums  creams and oils. if you go overboard  sprinkle some baby powder or dry shampoo on your hair and use your blow dryer to blast the area with cool air. if you use mousse or foam  spray out a cloud the size of a golf ball. pat your hands together and finger comb it through your hair  starting at your roots.  this can be quite damaging to your hair  so use a thermal heat protectant and the lowest heat setting on your blow dryer. you also want to use a blow dryer with a concentrator attachment that will direct the heat so your hair isn t flying about  creating frizz. work in 2 3  sections  using a large  round boar bristle or nylon brush. firmly roll under your hair as you pass over it with the blow dryer.   make sure the blow dryer is pointed in a downward direction to smooth hair cuticles. always start at your roots and move to the ends.  the goal when trying to make wavy hair hold its wave or to make it curlier is to avoid anything that will pull on the waves. blow drying with a diffuser is one way. flip your head over and to the sides to scrunch whether air drying or using a blow dryer.   use lower heat and speed settings when using a blow dryer for a more

query	198	hear baby s heartbeat heart rate monitor hear the fetal heartbeat  a basic stethoscope is one of the easiest ways to listen to the fetal heartbeat at home. when you are between 18 and 20 weeks pregnant  the heartbeat should be strong enough for you to listen to with this method. simply place the stethoscope on your belly and listen. you may have to move it around a bit to find the heartbeat. be patient.quality does matter  so make sure to purchase a stethoscope from a reputable seller. you can find a wide variety of brands at your local drugstore  and even at a store selling office supplies. or borrow one from a friend or family member in the medical field if you can.    new technology can make it very easy to listen to your baby s heartbeat wherever you are. there are several different apps that you can purchase and download to your smartphone to listen to the heartbeat. some will even allow you to record the sound of the heartbeat so you can play it for your friends and family.these are most reliable later in pregnancy.    you can buy relatively inexpensive fetal heart rate monitors to use at home. this can be a great option if you are prone to stress and are reassured by listening to the heartbeat between visits to your doctor. however  you should be aware that these monitors are not as strong as the ones used by your doctor. don t expect them to be able to pick up the sound of the heartbeat until you are in at least your fifth month of pregnancy.make sure to consult your doctor before purchasing an at home monitor. once you have one  follow the instructions carefully.    even when you are using the proper tools  there are many reasons that you may not be able to detect the fetal heartbeat yourself. it s important to know that things such as the baby s position and your weight can impact whether or not you will clearly hear a heartbeat. if you feel there is reason to be concerned  make sure to contact your healthcare provider right away.  the relationship between you and your doctor or midwife is very important. when you are pregnant  make sure that you are working with a healthcare professional whom you trust. talk to your doctor about your baby s development  and the best ways for you to hear the heartbeat  both at home and in her office. choose a doctor who thoroughly and patiently answers all of your questions.  ask your doctor when you can first expect to hear the heartbeat. most physicians will schedule for a prenatal exam in your ninth or tenth week. before your visit  make sure to prepare a list of questions to ask your doctor. the moment will be even more special if you understand what is happening and what to expect.this will be an exciting and emotional visit. ask your partner or a close friend or family member to come with you to the appointment to share in your excitement.    talk to your doctor about what type of exam he will use to hear the heartbeat. typically  you will first hear the sound when your doctor or technician uses a fetal doppler  which uses sound waves to amplify the heartbeat. you will lie down on an exam table and the doctor will move a small probe on the surface of your stomach. this is a painless procedure.while your doctor can usually detect the baby s heartbeat at nine to 10 weeks  sometimes it takes until 12 weeks to easily detect it.    if your doctor schedules you for an early ultrasound  you may be able to hear the heartbeat through ultrasound as soon as your eighth week of pregnancy. this is typically performed early if you have some elevated risk factors in your pregnancy. otherwise  the doctor will typically wait until you are at least 10 12 weeks along.   be aware that your doctor might be able to use a stethoscope to listen to your baby s heartbeat. however  this instrument is not as powerful as others  so he likely will not do this until you are well into your second trimester. your doctor or midwife might also use a fetoscope  which is specially designed to listen to fetal heartbeats.  when you are pregnant  it is important to know the stages of your baby s development. that way  you will know when you can logically expect to hear the heartbeat  and you can correlate this information with other development milestones. for example  it s good to know that you can expect that your doctor can usually detect the baby s heartbeat by weeks eight  nine  or 10. remember that conception dates are not always precise. don t immediately be alarmed if you think your baby hasn t developed fast enough   your conception date may be off by a week or two.    there are many things you can do to help your baby s heart to grow strong and healthy. during your pregnancy  avoid alcohol  smoking  and recreational drugs. you should usually take folic acid supplements to help your baby develop.eat a healthy diet and avoid caffeine.    even though you will be anxious to hear the fetal heartbeat  make sure that you know there are risks involved when using at home fetal heart monitors. the main drawback is that hearing a healthy heartbeat can lead to a false sense of security in expectant mothers. for example  if you are not feeling  right   but can hear the heartbeat  you might put off going to the doctor. make sure to listen to your body and contact your doctor at the first sign that something is wrong. do not rely too heavily on at home monitors.in fact  having a monitor may actually increase your stress level.    if your doctor agrees  make it a habit to be in tune with your baby s heartbeat. this experience can be a great way for you to bond with your baby bump. to get into a relaxed state  try taking a warm bath and talking to your belly. when you are far along in your pregnancy  the baby will begin to respond to your voice and moods. your baby can start to hear sounds at around 23 weeks.

query	206	get a large jar marmite eat marmite  in britain and other places where marmite is popular  it s often eaten as a spread on toast  crackers  and other baked bread products. since marmite has such a strong salty  yeasty taste  it s usually eaten in small quantities even by its fans. if you re using your marmite as a spread  rather than using a full spoonful of it like you might for jam or peanut butter  instead  use a tiny pea sized amount  like you would for toothpaste .   ideally  when you spread this tiny amount of marmite on your bread  it should leave a paper thin layer of marmite   just enough to discolor the bread. you don t want any noticeable  thickness  to the marmite  as this will give a seriously overpowering taste.    one of the most common ingredients to combine with marmite is butter  especially when the marmite is being used as a spread. butter s rich  smooth taste pairs well with the strong  salty flavor of marmite. if you hate marmite  try applying a generous helping of butter to your bread before or after you spread on the marmite   the more you use  the less you ll taste the marmite.to many  this makes marmite much more palatable.    getting used to eating marmite is like the old saying about how to boil a frog   if you drop a frog into a pot of hot water  it will jump out  but if you drop it into a pot of lukewarm water and slowly increase the heat  it won t know anything s wrong until it s too late rather than trying to wolf down your marmite in a few huge bites  instead  take small nibbles to begin. gradually  as you make progress  the strong  salty taste should become more bearable.   if you re having a hard time swallowing even small bites of your marmite spread  try moving each bite carefully to the back of your mouth so that you can swallow it without much chewing. this should minimize the amount you have to taste the marmite  but be careful   you ll need to take small bites to be able to swallow them without choking.    to keep the overpowering taste of marmite under control  try taking a drink after each bite of marmite you take. the drink will act as a chaser   the more you sip  the less you ll taste the marmite and the quicker the taste will leave your mouth.   plain  ordinary tap water is a good zero calorie chaser  but if you really hate the taste of marmite  you may want to consider a stronger tasting beverage. after each bite  try drinking a swig of your favorite soft drink  or  if you re old enough  a stiff cocktail. the strong flavors of these beverages should help  drown out  the marmite taste.    the senses of taste and smell closely interact with each other to produce the  effect  that you experience when eating food. the way something smells can affect the way it tastes to you  and vice versa .if you hate the taste of marmite  there s a very good chance you won t care for its smell  either. in this case  try your hardest not to smell the marmite as you eat it. usually  the taste  though still strong  will be a little less intense if you make an effort to hold your breath until the marmite has been swallowed  or nearly so .    perhaps the single easiest way to make marmite more manageable is to simply not make it the central feature of your dish. pairing marmite with other foods  especially ones with distinctive  powerful flavors of their own  can make it much more palatable. though you may never enjoy marmite by itself  you may even find that you enjoy it when paired with other foods or used as a minor ingredient in a large recipe    there s no  wrong  way to eat marmite   any food you enjoy it with is fair game. just a few foods that some marmite fans enjoy pairing their favorite yeasty spread with are eggs  cheese  meat  seafood  apricots  marmalade  and more in the next section  we ll explore a few more flavorful marmite combinations. feel free to use any of them as you see fit  or make your own     in small quantities  marmite can give soups  stews  and other hearty liquid dishes a rich  savory flavor  and also works great as a browning agent . for instance  try mixing a spoonful of marmite into a pot of french onion soup in place of beef stock   the flavor of the finished soup goes great with bread and cheese  just like ordinary marmite.in general  you can usually get away with substituting marmite mixed with water  your favorite vegetables  and a little oil for beef broth. this can allow you to make great tasting vegetarian versions of all your favorite carnivorous soups and stews.  many marmite fans agree  the spread pairs deliciously with a wide variety of cheeses. sharp cheddar is an especially great choice   the salty  yeasty flavor of the marmite enhances the  sharpness  of the cheese  making for a bold flavored  but tasty  combination. try adding a few slices of cheese to standard marmite and butter toast for a satisfying breakfast.  though it may sound odd  marmite can be a tasty ingredient to include in glazes and sauces for meat dishes. used correctly  marmite can give the outer  crust  of roasted meats  poultry  and seafood a rich  distinct  umami   savory  flavor. try painting a light mixture of melted butter and marmite over a whole roasted chicken for a savory treat   you should only need a spoonful or two to cover it.   if you use marmite as a meat glaze  you may want to forego sprinkling salt from the salt shaker on your meat  especially if you need to be careful about your sodium intake. marmite has a very high salt content   it s more than 10  salt by mass   believe it or not  some people not only eat their spaghetti with marmite   they love it. if you re willing to experiment  try adding a half teaspoon of marmite to al dente noodles along with a small helping of olive oil  you may want to avoid using fine tomato sauces or cheeses to top your dish until you re positive that you enjoy it    note that some fans of this recipe describe the flavor as being similar to the british snack food  twiglets .  if you ve recently gained an appreciation for marmite and you re looking to expand your repertoire  try this marmite centered sampler dish  which works as a hearty meal on its own and scales easily for larger groups. start by boiling a few eggs in a pot of water until they re hard boiled. depending on the size of the eggs  this should take about eight to ten minutes.   run cold water over the eggs after they re done cooking. cooling them down halts the cooking process and prevents them from overcooking.  next  let s get our vegetables ready for the marmite. wash a bell pepper  a handful of cherry tomatoes  a cucumber  a carrot  and a few clumps of broccoli under running water. cut each into small bite size pieces. any shapes that look appealing are fine  but  for efficiency s sake  you ll probably want to julienne your bell pepper  cut it into skinny strips  and take thin circular slices from your cucumber.    finally  make a few golden brown slices of marmite s most well known companion dish. you can use white  wheat  or even specialty breads like sourdough and rye here   it s up to you  when the toast is ready  butter it. as noted above  butter and marmite pair quite well together.    arrange your vegetables  eggs  and toast in a circle around the outside of a large plate. open a jar of marmite and place it in the center of the dish.   don t forget to peel your hard boiled eggs. if you d like to use them to hold marmite like crackers  cut the eggs into quarters or eights to make skinny  curved slices.    using a butter knife  put small portions of marmite on each piece of vegetable or egg before biting in. you can eat the toast without marmite as a  chaser  to ready your mouth for the next bit piece of marmite  or  if you re bold  just spread a tiny dollop of marmite on each piece of bread.   if you want to  you can even dip your foods directly into the jar of marmite. be careful   it s easy to get more marmite than you intended this way   
query	207	make mentos react with coke mentos make a diet coke and mentos rocket  for the purposes of this example  we re using diet coke  but you can actually use any type of diet soda  as long as it contains aspartame .   warm soda causes better explosions  so avoid using cold refrigerated soda.for best results  purchase room temperature soda and then let it sit outside in the sun or in a pot full of hot  not boiling  water for a few hours before using it.    experiments have shown that while the original mint mentos will give you a longer explosion  mentos fruit will give you slightly shorter but more intense explosion.other experiments have shown that mint mentos are the better choice because the gum arabic found in the mint coating reduces surface tension and quickens the carbon dioxide s escape from the bottle  making for a more intense explosion.as the rocket is more of a fast acting affair  you might want to go for mint mentos. if you have the time and money to do so  why not try one bottle with mint mentos and one with fruit mentos  and then compare the results     you probably have this one lying around your house already  but if you don t  you should be able to buy a roll just about anywhere  hardware stores are a safe bet .    wearing goggles will not only protect your eyes from the soda mentos concoction  but also from any other debris  for example  the lid  that might fly out from the bottle once it hits the ground and explodes.    your rocket is likely to bounce around like crazy  make sure it has enough room to do that. if you re in a parking lot  make sure there are no cars nearby for at least a 50 foot radius  if not more.   if there s a field or empty lot nearby  go there to make your rocket. you don t want to risk doing damage to anyone s car or home  as it could cost you or your parents a lot of money to repair.    it s possible you ll get covered in the sticky diet coke mentos solution. wear clothes and shoes that you don t mind getting wet and sticky   preferably ones that are easy to wash.    bring your 2 liter bottle of diet coke  your pack of mentos  your masking tape  and your safety goggles to wherever you ve decided to build your rocket.    place the strips of tape on a flat surface  with their sticky sides facing up. do not allow them to stick together.    the more mentos you use  the better the explosion  however  you don t want to the mentos to dip too far into the diet coke otherwise the explosion may begin before you can screw the lid on the bottle.    they should look just as they did when they were still in their original packaging  stacked on top of one another like a roll of coins.    be sure to leave the sides of the mentos exposed.    you ll use this piece to attach the mentos to the bottle cap  so ensure that it s small enough to fit inside the cap.    take the 3 inch strip of sticky rolled tape that you ve just created and attach it to the top of the taped roll of mentos. this will create a  loaded  mentos cartridge that you can place inside the diet coke bottle.    put the cap on a flat surface  with its inside facing upwards. place the mentos cartridge  sticky tape side up  into the soda cap and press down to fasten it there.   be careful not to press too hard  as you don t want any mentos falling out of the cartridge     this step is optional. if you re worried about the mentos prematurely falling into the diet coke  you can secure the cartridge by running one more piece of masking tape around the entire roll  including the cap.    the cap should be securely on the bottle  but not closed too tightly. if it s closed too tightly  the cap might not come off when you throw the bottle  and the rocket won t work. as you twist the cap on  you ll also want to make sure that the mentos do not touch the diet coke yet.  if it seems like the mentos will touch the diet coke  you can either dump a small amount of diet coke out before screwing the cap on  redo your mentos cartridge to contain fewer mentos  or you can try your luck and screw the cap on as quickly as possible.    shake it so that the mentos fall into the diet coke  and then keep shaking. do this for at least a few seconds.    there are several different methods for  launching  your rocket    a popular and effective one is to throw the bottle high up into the air and let it fall on to the ground  preferably hard ground  like cement . this is the best method if you re worried about getting hit by the rocket  as you can throw it far away from you and even run in the opposite direction. another method is to throw the bottle at a side angle so that when it hits the ground  the ground knocks off its cap. yet another method is to throw the bottle at more of a 90 degree angle  cap first  on to the ground.    you can skip this step if your rocket works right away. if the rocket doesn t go off when you throw it  pick it up and try unscrewing the cap a little before throwing it again. just be careful not to unscrew the cap too far  otherwise you re likely to end up covered in diet coke.  when the bottle hits the ground  its cap should fly off and the diet coke mentos solution will shoot out of the bottle s opening. this should cause the bottle to fly high up into the air. depending on how you throw it  the bottle might also bounce around sporadically for several seconds.   side angle launches generally seem to cause the bottle to bounce low and skid along the ground. vertical launches  in which you throw the bottle straight up into the air and let it fall to the ground  tend to give the rocket more height as it shoots upward. if the bottle is still full of diet coke and mentos but it s stopped moving on the ground  you can try to launch it again to see if it has any more flight left in it.    once you ve finished your experiment  don t forget to pick up after yourself. clean up any bits of tape or mentos packaging that might have dropped to the ground as you built your rocket. and pick up the rocket  clean out the bottle and put it in the recycling bin  or bring it to the bottle depot .    the more mentos  the better the explosion. experiment with putting different amounts of mentos into the diet coke bottle to see what yields the best explosion.    studies have shown that mint and fruit mentos yield different explosions. try mixing them together in one cartridge and adding them to your diet coke bottle to see what sort of explosion they cause when they are mixed together.    fill an empty 4 liter milk jug with 4 liters  2 two liter bottles  of diet coke. leave enough room at the top to add at least an 8 mento cartridge.   as with the original rocket recipe  stick the mentos cartridge to the lid of the milk jug  fasten the lid  shake the container to release the mentos into the diet coke  then throw the jug high up into the air and let it hit the pavement hard.    get together with your friends and each make your own rocket. set up a flag or some other way of measuring height  and have a judge watch and name the winner.

query	212	install replacement window install replacement windows  this choice should be made based on the styling of your home  as well as your budget. the four common frame types are  wood  vinyl or metal clad wood  and all vinyl or all wood.   wood frames  if the exterior of your home features natural wood siding  a wood frame will complement your home nicely. wood frames are generally more expensive  but they do offer a low heat transfer and can be very energy efficient. if you re looking for low maintenance  however  they don t exactly fit the bill. they must be properly primed and painted  as well as repainted every few years to maintain their appeal. vinyl metal clad window frames  many replacement window manufacturers offer a wood frame window with a metal or vinyl  wrapping  on the exterior of the window. as long as the  wrapping  is sealed  the window is relatively maintenance free. you can also choose a color that complements the exterior of your home  without having to repaint every few years.  keep in mind that although the window unit is maintenance free  you will still have to either paint the exterior trim to match the window wrapping or replace the trim with a vinyl product like azek.   metal window frames  if you re looking for low maintenance as well as low cost  a metal frame might be a good choice. metal windows and siding are less stylish than they used to be  but that doesn t mean that you can t make them look good in your home. vinyl frames  vinyl replacement windows are extremely popular because they are easy to install  cost effective  and energy efficient.         some people take the height measurement from the top of the sill. this leaves room to attach a  header expander  to the top of the new window. others  though  dislike using header expanders because they decrease effective window size  and complicate the trim process.    since the new unit will need to be installed at least close to plumb  adjust your measurements accordingly. this will ensure that you have the largest size window that can be installed plumb  and level in the opening provided.    this is due to the fact that replacement windows are made to order in increments of 1 4.     this will keep the paint from chipping or peeling away from the casing when you remove the stops. this will also make removing the window stops easier  paint is a surprisingly good adhesive.   use a thin flat bar or even a putty knife to separate stubborn joints. this will minimize denting or marring other parts of the window trim.    using a hinging motion  swing the top of the window into the room until it is horizontal. then  twist the window into the opening by lifting up one side and pressing down on the other until the window is free.   every window is different some might take a little muscle to remove. don t worry about scratching the inside of the jambs while removing the window  it ll get covered anyway. if the window is cracked or particularly stubborn  wear gloves and eye protection in case it shatters while removing it.    if the original window was an older  weighted window  there may be pulleys at the top of the jamb that need to be removed. clear any dust from the bottom corners of the frame to ensure a good bond with the sealant.    if there were weights  remove the pulleys and apply a small amount of caulk to any holes.    sill flashing for a vinyl window is an  l  shaped piece of vinyl that is the same width as the replacement window unit. the vertical part of the  l  shape is slotted  allowing it to clip onto the bottom  outer edge of the window unit and shed water away from the bottom of the window.    mark both sides where it hits the exterior window stops. remove the lower part of the  l  shape on both sides as marked to allow the sill flashing to fit into place. once trimmed  lay the sill flashing back in place and trace the outside edge with a pencil.    make sure you get both sides and the top. then  apply a 1 4  bead directly to the wood sill on the inside of your pencil line.   nan  the bottom should be angled away and in to the opening. once the bottom of the unit has cleared the sill and is against the exterior stops  press down on the window and swing the top into the frame.   press the window firmly and evenly against the stops to ensure a good seal.     these are usually located about four inches from the top and bottom on both sides.    be sure the window is centered in the window opening.  keep in mind that vinyl is much softer  and more flexible than wood. over tightening the screws can damage the frame of the window.    nan nan  leave about a 1 4  gap along the bottom. this gap should be parallel to the windowsill.   if the gap is larger on the right side  loosen the top right screw and tighten the top left screw or loosen the bottom left screw and tighten the bottom right screw. if the gap is larger on the left side  loosen the top left screw and tighten the top right screw or loosen the bottom right screw and tighten the bottom left screw.   nan nan  if necessary  apply a thin bead around the perimeter to eliminate any voids  and leave a

query	213	cut stained glass cut glass  you ll need a large flat surface  preferably one that is slightly soft and won t scratch your glass. work in an area that is easy to clean.          avoid working over carpet because of the risk of getting glass shards on the floor if the glass breaks. for their own safety keep pets and children away from your workspace and materials.    any grime or silica on the glass can ruin your score. wipe these away by running a cloth or your finger along the surface of the glass where you plan to score.           glass cutters are about the size of a pencil and use a diamond or a hardened wheel to mark a score into glass so that it can be broken cleanly along a line. you can buy cutting oil at a stained glass store or use a small amount of kerosene.           the score must run from one edge of the glass to the other edge. you can write on the glass with a marker  preferably with a straight edge  if you are cutting a straight line. you can also mark on paper and place the glass on top of the paper.          cut should not be very long. scores longer than two feet have a high failure rate when breaking. make sure your marks leave about six inches of glass on each side to grip and break. if you cut smaller pieces  you may need to use special tools  like pliers or a light hammer  to break off glass you can t get a hold of.    an oiled cutter creates a smoother score line. make sure to look at the wheel and make sure it is lined up the way you want the glass to cut.           use a yardstick or a normal desk ruler. you need something that has a thick enough profile that it won t conflict with the wheel on the cutter.           listen for a smooth sound like ripping silk. a gritty sound means that you are pushing too hard or that you did not oil your cutter. the less sound you make  the better your score will be.          if you push too hard  a very common mistake   your cut gets  hot   meaning that it snaps and pops. you are aiming to get a uniform score. if you are pressing too hard in one spot and perfectly in another  the glass will not break the way that you want it to. microscopic imperfections in your score will cause your cut to go askew.    do not run back and forth over the line if you miss a spot.           you want a score that is not popping and is barely visible  if you were to wipe the oil away. it should look like a small scratch  nothing more. make sure it runs completely from one edge to the other.           hold the glass as if you were trying to break a potato chip in half with two hands.           your elbows do not move. simply twist your wrists  your right wrist will turn clockwise and your left will turn counterclockwise . imagine that the score you made is half the depth of the glass and now you need to  open it up  by using the score as a weak spot. you re done as soon as you have two pieces of glass instead of the one you started with.          when the glass breaks  it may simply start as a  run.  if it only runs an inch or so  apply a little more twisting pressure and it will continue to run.    this edge will be where the vertical edge meets the horizontal surfaces. not only does sanding reduce the chances of your being cut  but sanded glass is less likely to chip along the edges and has some added strength.           if you are cutting a freehand shape  make sure you are breaking along lines that run from edge to edge. mark your lines with a marker or set your glass over your pattern.           you should be able to score along gentle curves normally with a steady hand. for tighter curves  make a series of marks that run along part of the curve and skew off at a tangent outside the piece you want.           you will start a run this way. follow the run with light pressure and you can watch the glass separate where you scored it. if your score is too close to the edge of a piece of glass  it may run to the edge instead of along your score because that is the easiest path for the run to take.           the smaller the relief cuts  the more accurate your cut will be. grip smaller pieces with pliers to snap them off.           this machine uses a spinning wheel with fine diamond chips as a grinder. turn on the router and press your curve firmly against the grinder to smooth out your curve  then sand as normal.         
query	214	recharge automotive battery recharge batteries  rechargeable batteries are most often charged in an a c adapter  which you can plug into a basic home outlet. these chargers feature terminals sized in a variety of ways  from aaa to d. depending on what kind of batteries you want to charge  you can usually find a charger appropriate for the size at any electronics or hardware store.   some chargers feature a variety of adaptable sizes  meaning you can charger aa and aaa on the same terminals. if you ve got a lot of different sized batteries  this would be an ideal choice. rapid chargers are similar to regular chargers  but often don t have a charge control mechanism that halts or slows the flow of voltage. these are effective at quickly charging batteries  but can reduce the life of the battery more significantly.    never try to recharge single use batteries  or you risk causing corrosion and damage to your charger. only try to recharge batteries specifically labeled  rechargeable.  if you ve got some dead single use batteries  dispose of them properly and buy rechargeable ones.   nickel metal hydride  nimh  batteries are common in consumer products  especially power tools  while lithium ion batteries are common in electronics. both varieties of battery are commonly used and both are rechargeable. when you first start to use a new set of rechargeable batteries  run them completely down before recharging them. this will decrease the possibility of a phenomenon called  memory effect   which is when the battery s capacity diminishes from being recharged prematurely. use a battery tester to determine if there is life left in a battery before attempting to recharge it. many battery testers are inexpensive  easy to use and provide an instant reading.    with most a c adapter chargers  a power light should come on automatically  or by flipping an  on  switch. make sure that any power indicator lights come on  and you ll be ready to start charging your batteries.   always defer to the manufacturer s instructions. read the battery charger instruction manual thoroughly  which should contain important information  including the time it takes to complete charging  a key to indicator lights and safety information specific to the batteries being used.    this means putting the positive     ends into contact with the charger s positive terminals and likewise with the negative     ends.   on most a c chargers  there should be a diagram showing you how to orient the batteries properly. generally  the flat side of the battery should rest against the spring  and the  bump  on the battery should rest against the flatter side.    most chargers should change a light from green to red  or vice versa when the batteries are fully charged. do not interrupt the process by unplugging the charger s cord or by removing the batteries early  or the battery life will be significantly diminished.    overcharging of batteries is the primary cause of a reduction in the life of the battery  especially in rapid charge chargers.    trickle charge  is a technique of lowering the charge to roughly 10 percent of the capacity of the battery  which is usually enough to keep a battery fully charged  without triggering the discharge that results in a diminished capacity of battery life.most manufacturer s don t recommend long term trickle charging  but if you have a charger with an adjustable charge rate  dropping it to a lower rate can be an effective way of keeping your batteries juiced.    make certain that the vehicle is shut off completely and remove the grounded terminal first  to prevent arcing  then move the battery to a well ventilated area to charge it.   it is possible to charge a battery without removing it  but you need to know whether or not the battery is grounded to the chassis  to avoid clipping the negative in the wrong place. if it is grounded to the chassis  clip the positive to the positive terminal  and the negative to the chassis. if it isn t  then clip the negative charger to the negative terminal  and the positive to the chassis.if you want to know how to jump your vehicle  read this article.    on most well used car batteries  corrosion will typically build up around the terminals  and it s important to clean these periodically to make sure that your battery terminals make good contact with the leads. the best way to do this is to use plain baking soda and water  and brush the terminals with an old toothbrush to remove the corrosion.   refill each cell with distilled water  to the proper manufacturer levels  if necessary. do not overfill. some lead acid batteries won t have removable ports  so defer to the manufacturer s instructions as always.    usually  you ll be able to find this in the owner s manual for your vehicle  if it isn t listed on the battery itself. if you re unsure  you can also usually visit any auto parts retailer and have them check for your  at no charge.    depending on your vehicle and the battery in it  you ll need a charger with enough capacity to recharge it. typically  batteries will be either 6 or 12 volts  but depending on whether or not your battery is a standard  agm  and deep charge model  you may need a stronger charger  depending.some chargers are manual  which means you ll have to shut them off when the battery is fully charged  while other automatic batteries will shut off when the battery is full. other than that  and slight differences in design  all chargers work in essentially the same way. again  if you re not sure  head to the auto parts store for a quick check. you don t have to pay for it  and you ll be sure you ve got the right info.    after you know the voltage of your battery  you can set the output voltage to match. most chargers have digital readouts  which just let you toggle up or down to the appropriate voltage. some chargers have adjustable rates  but it s always better to start lower and slower than you think your battery might be able to take.    chargers come with two clips  one of which you should attach to the positive battery terminal and one of which to the negative. switch the charger to the  off  position and remove the plug from the wall to be safe. don t let the clips touch each other at any point during the process  and turn away from the battery itself when you make the final connection.   first  connect the positive cable  which is usually the ungrounded one. next  connect a jumper cable or an insulated battery cable that s at least two feet long to the negative post  and connect the negative battery cable to this cable. if the battery is still in the car  you ll want to clip the ungrounded cable to the ungrounded peg on the battery  and the grounded cable somewhere to the chassis of the car. never clip a charger to the carburetor  fuel lines  or the body of the vehicle.    stretch the cables as far as they go  and never place the charger directly above the battery that s being charged. corrosive gasses will sometimes be emitted from the battery  which can be dangerous.    depending on the battery and the charger you re using  it may take as many as 8 12 hours to charge your battery. if you re using an automatic charger  it should shut off as soon as the battery is charged. if you re using a manual charger  you ll need to check and make sure the battery is charged before you do.   if you want to know how to use a voltmeter to do this  read this article.

query	218	replace central heating install central heating   choose a gas boiler that is large enough to heat your home and supply hot water to the sinks and bathtub  yet isn t too large. choosing a boiler that is too large will result in higher monthly expenses due to loss of heat from the boiler. if you feel this is an issue  then consider purchasing a new energy efficient boiler.        select radiators that offer adequate heating capacity while complementing the interior of your home. the most effective types of radiators use fins to radiate heat into the air.       choose a control system that comes with clear instructions for installation. if you re not sure it s clear enough  call the manufacturer and ask for a detailed description of the installation process.       gas boilers and radiators include specifications about their heating capacity. make sure you choose parts that add to a total heating capacity that is adequate for your home.       when assessing the necessary heating capacity  remember to take into account that windows  doors and exterior walls all loose heat in the colder seasons.          this will serve as a blueprint for installing all of the separate parts.   plan to install your boiler at a spot in your home that allows for easy connection to the water pipes  as well as the gas main  and offers a ventilation shaft to the roof.       when choosing where to install radiators  it s important to note that most radiators are installed beneath windows to combat heat loss through the window. however  if your windows reach to the floor  place the radiators adjacent to the window for the most effective heat control.       plan to lay the pipes either along the walls or under the floor. if you re going to lay them under the floor  make sure to clearly mark where they will be so you don t hammer nails through them when laying the flooring.         nan  they ll need to be about 4 to 6 inches  10 to 15 cm  from the floor to leave room for the valves to the pipes and allow for cleaning. install a wheel valve on the flow connection and a lock shield valve on the return connection. this allows you to regulate the water flow.    you ll need copper pipes with either compression or capillary joints. make sure the pipes vent to the radiators in order to avoid air locks and malfunctioning of the system.    follow the manufacturer s instructions.    again  follow all of the manufacturer s instructions. remember to have a certified contractor perform the connection to the gas main.    activate the heating pump and re vent the system. then switch on the boiler and balance the flow of heated water to each radiator by using the lock shield valves.  
query	219	indicate popularity chardonnay change how you think about popularity  there are a number of  types  of popularity and each comes with its own distinct elements and drawbacks    friendly   the nice person who everyone wants to be friends with  this method of being popular easily turns into being popular for being a people pleaser  and such a person is never far away from being dropped or ignored should the friendliness not deliver on demands. funny   a funny person is the type who can always get you to smile. they are rarely very depressed and even if they are  they don t blame others or give others a hard time. these make great friends and are often loved by the people around him or her.  guys are not funnier than girls...  mean   these are people who don t care who they hurt to get whatever they want. they will use insults  abuse and ignoring as means to destabilize any person who doesn t support their agenda. people who try to climb to the top will often act more like a mean popular person without actually being  popular  yet. queens   a queen is someone who is popular for acting far beyond their age  for example  dressing or acting like an 18 year old at the age of 12  playing boss when they re the receptionist  etc. . the snob   this popular type tends to be bratty  rude and inconsiderate of anyone they don t feel is  good enough  for them  with a tendency to disdain anyone else s experience or lifestyle if they consider that they have had better experiences or own better houses  cars  etc. the happeners   this type just happens to be popular. it may be due to wealth  standing up for themselves all the time and not caring what others think  owning something others want  being related to someone famous  etc. while this person may not initially  manipulate  their popularity  if they do get too caught up in it  there may be a temptation to abuse the popularity for their own gain. it s up to you whether you find these categorizations fit with your world view  and you re free to add  subtract and change them in your own mapping of popularity   but whatever you decide  negative forms of popularity still remain unkind and unwanted.    any popularity   even the apparently nice and friendly popular sort   is overrated but for some people  being popular makes them feel more important and motivated to achieve things in life. that can be a good thing if they don t use their popularity to hurt others. however  popularity used for personal gain at the expense of other people s dignity is harmful and unkind. indeed  pointless self centered social climbing that results in harm to certain people and that requires the popular person to distance themselves from others  feelings and to be selfish  arrogant and aloof  makes for a negative style of being popular that doesn t endear the popular person to people through love or respect. while such a person may feel that it s their popularity that has people responding to them  often it s fear and dislike that cause people to do their bidding in order to avoid possible negative consequences. that is hardly a good side of popularity    another big negative is how much time you have to spend with your friends. if you re too popular and everyone wants a minute with you  there won t be a minute in the day that you have to yourself or to spend with your close friends. sometimes people who are too much in demand neglect themselves and wind up lonely because they don t have time for the friends they most care about. acquaintances are casual and will drop you as soon as pick you up. real friends stand by you when the wind blows against you. people will get jealous and cruel. if you re perceived as popular you may get picked on for being a snob just for having some judgment about who you like or not. it can get rough.    judging is a thoughtless and often hurtful thing done without consideration for its truthfulness or its impact. to judge someone means the same thing as criticizing  but it s more emotionally based and is definitely colored by one s personal prejudices. many of the people who are popular  normally the  ladder climbers    tend to judge others whom they don t consider to be as high as them on the  social ladder  and they find them wanting according to their own value system. a person is found wanting when they don t fit the popular person s ideal of  the right kind of person to be seen with  and that means they ve  judged the book by its cover  and refuse to get to know the other person any further.   how do you avoid judging people  be aware that saying the simplest brush off such as  whatever  or giving someone looks such as rolling your eyes and doing or saying anything that shows that you think another person is weird  awkward or different can affect someone in the deepest way. moreover  you may feel frustrated or annoyed by someone else but that isn t a reason to find fault with other people. often we find fault with another because it s an inner fault of our own that we re trying not to deal with. always think before you act  and stop any judging before it gets worse. be aware that your body language plays a big part in issuing a judgment on another person. you can give someone the impression that you re criticizing them simply by crossing your arms  giving bored or  weirded out  facial expressions  picking fluff off your as they talk or seeming like you aren t listening or that you re actively ignoring them. instead of relying on these dismissive and ultimately cowardly ways of interacting with another human being  try a smile and look the person who is communicating in the eye. even if you don t want to spend more than a minute in their presence  be thoughtful when you are in their field of vision and hearing and kindly respond back without blabbering on about yourself or giving them negative bodily expressions. making people feel valued is a far better way to be popular  or at least respected  than disdaining or belittling them.    no one deserves to be pointed out as someone who is different in a  bad  way. one good example would be the different responses given to jokes or statements made by a popular person and by someone who isn t  a girl considered to be  popular  says a joke  or a witty remark and everyone laughs. yet  on the other hand  a supposed  nerd  says the same thing and everyone stares silently. if it was as funny to laugh at the  popular  person  why suddenly is it as boring to ignore the  nerd   if this is popularity  why does everyone want it  by singling out someone for better treatment and singling out someone else for poor treatment  this negative aspect of popularity results in skewed values. those who participate in this strange dichotomy are acting unfairly and are also conforming to the power being wielded unjustly by the popular person.   fairness doesn t mean you have to hang around with people who don t click with you. fairness means recognizing that regardless of other people s interests and approaches to life  their preferences are as equally valid as your own preference. all that that requires of any person is to acknowledge the value of the other person and to not abuse the differences between you for personal gain.    being yourself is tough during the height of popularity. you ll feel pressured to change yourself to please others so that even while you re setting some of the trends  you re also ensuring that you fit in and don t deviate too much from the established  norm . conformity during popularity includes such things as having to wear certain clothes  act in certain ways  say certain things and possibly even to do things you re not meant to or that go against your own beliefs and values. the number one golden rule in life is to be yourself  so when being popular loses sight of this need  it becomes negative. and once you ve changed to fit the needs of popularity  there is often no going back  especially after you ve convinced yourself that this is the only way to garner other people s interest in you.   think about why everyone is so excited to change just to be able to sit in a big circle  to gossip at the water cooler or to have a certain date that everyone else has been drooling after  do what you think is right rather than what you think is popular  otherwise you will forever be the slave to other people s opinions and baying. consider that in order to be popular  you are often amplifying the less noble and more crass elements of society. that may shock you initially but think about it carefully and you may well be surprised at how much of popularity feeds off shortcomings and vices.    labeling people can lead to misery and tears  self consciousness and even depression. calling people  loners    losers  or  freaks  is definitely hurtful as you re seeking to alienate them. and no  it s not okay if a hollywood actor uses the term in a film  you should be able to recognize acting for what it is and not excuse yourself as a copycat.   be aware that popularity through name calling is simply mean and cruel. it does nothing for the name caller s internal well being and it ends up harming others by being disrespectful of their worth. feelings matter  so the popular person needs to think about the impact of name calling beyond merely establishing their own rank as a nasty name calling often results in a retaliation by reclaiming  which takes away the power of the name calling. it is commonplace for groups of people lumped together under a label to reclaim terms that were initially derogatory and carry their own source of pride in the term. so ultimately  all the popular name caller has achieved is to drive the  different  people together into a collective that is capable of turning around and responding with a big  so what .    isn t it better to have your own real friends on whom you can rely and who say what they mean without sugar coating it or abusing you  sitting in a big circle or atop the  ladder  won t always ensure that you re also a good person and often the drive for maintaining popularity leaves you hollow within and unable to pursue your real self for fear of unmasking the ideal you ve molded in order to be popular. will everyone really back you up during the tough times  and make you feel like a golden star through the good times  will they do this  or just let you sit with them at lunch  sitting with the richest person with a huge house or hanging out with the person who has the coolest clothes isn t always the solution to finding a true friend. find someone who will always be there for you and be aware that most of the time  popularity isn t likely to bring that for you. indeed  when you re exceptionally popular  you won t always feel like you have a really true  deep down  accepting friend. be careful what you wish for.    popularity is fake  fleeting and ephemeral  what s worse is that everyone can see right through it even as they pretend to honor the current popularity. realize that they re ready to change their allegiance when the next best thing comes along though  that s how fickle allies are to popularity.   think it through. is this all real  or is it just a game  be honest to yourself and think about the consequences to yourself and those you really do care about in your life. tell yourself what you think. stand for what you believe in and don t be fake.    being popular for the right reasons is a lot harder because it isn t about shaping your world or pursuing certain ways of being or appearances. rather  it s about respecting others as they are and engaging people with interest  compassion and love. if that seems goofy or hard  then it s probable you haven t yet tried it. real popularity  if there is such a thing  involves being attractive to people because you make them feel attractive about themselves. notice what others do and say  believe in people  lift their spirits and praise them. as jeremy bentham once said   the best way to make them think you love them  is to love them in reality.  there is no easy way around this but the good news is that doing so is guaranteed to make you feel happier too.  
query	220	remove mascara eye shadow apply shadow on hooded eyes  while this is important for everyone  it s especially critical for those with hooded eyes. primer creates a base for your makeup that helps it stay put and last all day.because hooded eyes are prone to smudging and smearing  primer can make all the difference.use your fingertip to apply the primer  and allow it to absorb into your skin for a minute or so before proceeding.    there are a variety of different eye shadow brushes that work well for different things. to apply your eye shadow most precisely  you will need a standard eye shadow brush  a tapered blending brush  and a firmer  straight brush. these three brushes will help you to get the most flawless application.you can find these brushes at a drugstore or beauty supply store.    for hooded eyes  you will use a light shade  a medium shade  and a dark shade  all with a matte finish. you will also need one light shimmer color for highlighting.when it comes to choosing the exact colors  it s a matter of personal preference. you can create a more natural look using cream and brown colors  with a gold or bronze shimmer. you can create a dramatic smoky eye with grays  blacks  and silver shimmer.  you can learn more about finding your best eye shadow here.    this will highlight the hood  drawing attention to the extra skin that you want to minimize. instead  use a shadow brush to apply a medium  matte color to your crease. this will give you dimension without emphasizing the hood.  this is another simple trick to make your eye appear larger and more open. after you ve applied the matte shadow to your crease and blended it  use your shadow brush to softly drag this color upwards to your brow bone only in the inner corners.you don t want this to be dark or as pigmented as your crease   just a light application of color to open your eyes.    if you have a beloved  light shimmer shadow  this is your chance to use it. by applying a bright shimmer into the inner corners of your eye  you will make your eyes appear vivid and youthful.hooded eyes can make you look perpetually drowsy  so this inner corner highlight is a great way to counteract that.  a light gold  a pastel pink  or a pearl color are perfect choices for this step. apply it lightly with a shadow brush or even with a fingertip.    the keyword here is light. you don t want to use a super pigmented  frosty color  because that will make your highlight look extremely bold and unnatural. instead  pick a soft  matte color in a color like champagne  baby pink  soft silver  or light brown. apply it with a light hand  directly under your brow. this will give your brow bone more dimension.  using a tapered blending brush  apply the dark shadow to the outer corner of your eye  focusing on the crease. this will accentuate the crease even more  carving it out to add depth. blend it thoroughly  so that there are no harsh lines in your shadow.  when it comes to hooded eyes  the focus should be on the inner and outer corners  which are most visible. in fact for many people with hooded eyes  the middle of the lid is completely hidden when your eyes are open. don t leave it naked though. apply a light color to the lid  softly blending it into the dark color on the outer corner and the shimmer in the inner corner.  just like eye shadow  a properly filled in eyebrow can help to enhance the shape of your hooded eye  making it look open and elongated. use an angled brow brush to fill in the thin  sparse areas of your eyebrow with a powder or gel.  use small  hair like strokes as you fill in your brows. use a spoolie to brush your brow hairs upwards in order to see every spot that needs to be filled in. for hooded eyes  it s very important to avoid dragging the tail of the eyebrow downwards. pay special attention to make sure the tail ends parallel with the outer corner of your eye. make sure it doesn t extend past that or swoop downwards dramatically  because this will make your hooded eye seem droopy.    rather than lining your entire eye with eyeliner  only apply the product to the outer corner on both the top and bottom lash lines. use an eyeliner that you can blend  such as a pencil. start applying the liner in the outer corner  moving inwards so that you ve lined about 1 3 of your bottom lash line. then  do the same thing on the top lash line.use a straight brush to blend the liner. the goal with this step is to soften out the line  helping it blend into your shadow. make sure to use a smudge proof eyeliner.    once again  adding a highlight to the inner corners of your eyes will make them look bigger  brighter  and more alert. this liner works with the shimmery shadow in your inner corners to really combat the droopiness of hooded eyes.a shimmery brown  bronze  gold or silver will work well for this step.    use your eyelash curler at the roots of your eyelashes  holding for a few seconds on each. curling your eyelashes upwards will also help to open your eyes up. then  apply your favorite mascara. for those with hooded eyes  your mascara is prone to rubbing off onto your brow bone. make sure you choose a smudge proof mascara to keep your lashes dark and luscious  but your brow bone mascara free.
query	221	put on fake eyelash eyelash extensions apply eyelash extensions  before selecting extensions  examine your own lashes. the longer and healthier they are  the more weight they can withstand.   if you ve never applied extensions before  consider starting with a half set to see how your natural lashes hold up. you can always add more extensions later if you want a fuller or more exaggerated look.    mink is the most expensive and synthetic is the least. the lengths usually range from 6mm to 17mm.extensions also come in a variety of thicknesses  curls and colors. think about what your ultimate goal is before making a choice.   for example  if your goal is to create a natural look  you could select medium length extensions in brown black. if you are buying extensions as part of a costume  or if you re going for a unique look  explore different color options and thicknesses.    once you ve settled on a basic length and thickness  choose individual lashes that vary slightly in length. a subtle variation will provide the most natural looking results.three sizes in a similar length range should be sufficient. the shortest extensions will be used to fill in any gaps in the lash line and keep the overall appearance from looking unnatural and crowded.    if you plan to apply the extensions yourself  get a kit from a beauty supply store. a kit will include different sized lashes  usually short  medium and long   along with all the tools you ll need for application   tweezers  adhesive  adhesive remover and an eyelash brush. if you ve never applied extensions before  buying a kit will make the process a lot easier.   each kit is different. read and follow the instructions included with the kit carefully. check the ingredients on the adhesive. make sure it doesn t have formaldehyde listed as an ingredient.    applying eyelash extensions on yourself can be risky  since the adhesive can irritate your skin or damage your natural lashes if not applied properly. if you don t feel comfortable applying extensions yourself  find a certified professional to do it for you the first time.   after going through the process once  you ll probably feel more at ease doing it at home. start by researching technicians in your area. make sure they re licensed and find out how long they ve been doing this professionally.  if this is your first time applying extensions  it s a good idea to have a friend nearby to help you out. the application process requires that you juggle several different tools and  when it comes to actually gluing the extensions on  you need to be completely still. your eye also needs to be completely shut when you glue it on  and all of this is difficult to do with just two hands.   the application process will go much faster and more smoothly with an assistant. it will also be a lot safer for you. there is a higher risk of getting adhesive in your eye and other mishaps when you re working alone.    for the adhesive to stick properly  your natural lashes must be clean and free of makeup residue. they also need to be completely dry. start by applying makeup remover to a cotton pad and gently swiping it across both eyes. remove every trace of makeup around the eye area. rinse the area with lukewarm water.          allow your eyelashes to dry before you begin applying the extensions. comb your upper lashes with an eyelash brush to smooth and separate them. this brush  which looks like a mascara wand  should come with your extension kit.    your extension kit should include some sort of gel pad or tape to help pat down the bottom lashes. this will protect your skin from the adhesive. the adhesive pad also makes it easier to see and work on the individual lashes. when your eyelid is closed  the upper lashes will be against the white color  emphasizing the areas where you re working.           since you re starting at the outermost corner of your eye  your longest extensions will be used first. squeeze a dime sized amount of lash adhesive onto a smooth surface that s easily accessible for you. then use the tweezers to grab your first cluster and carefully dip the knotted end in the adhesive.          you only need a tiny amount of glue. if you use too much  the end result will look messy.  slowly drop the synthetic lash onto your natural lash  as close to the base of your eyelashes as possible. the glue should only touch your lash  not your skin. once the extension is dropped onto your natural lash  you will have about 60 seconds to situate it before the glue sets.          after you do one eye  do the same for the other. you will work back and forth to ensure both eyes look even. the glue can cause eyelid irritation if it touches your skin. make sure the glue touches your natural lashes only.    for the most natural look  the longest extensions will go on the outer edges. continue until you ve applied three to four of the longest extensions to the outer third of both eyes. make sure the extensions aren t too close together  since you will be filling in between them with shorter pieces.          use the tweezers to adjust each extension as needed within the first 60 seconds of dropping it.    work from the outside corners inward  just as you did before. be sure to do one eye  then the other. work back and forth so both eyes look even.          as you work  use the tweezers to periodically push the applied extensions down onto your natural lashes. this will help you keep everything in place. take your time. extension application is not a quick process.    use the medium length extensions and place three to four of them on your lashes. continue to work from the outside in. cover the middle third of your eyelid on both sides.           the short ones can be a little harder to work with  so just go in as far as you can. then use the shortest extensions to fill in any empty spaces you see in the middle sections of both eyes.           do not apply any mascara or eye makeup for several hours after application. if possible  try not to touch the extensions at all. give freshly applied extensions at least 12 to 24 hours before getting them wet. the life of your extensions will vary based on the type and how well they were applied  but they should last anywhere from two to eight weeks.professionally applied extensions should last through one growth cycle. this varies from person to person  but it s usually about six to eight weeks.    use an eyelash brush or a clean mascara wand to gently brush them out every morning. try to sleep on your back at night. this will cut down on the amount of time you need to spend every morning combing them out.           mascara applied to the base of the extensions usually ends up getting clumpy.   do not curl your eyelashes before you apply mascara. this can pull the extensions out. avoid water proof mascara completely. it s too hard to remove.do not wear oil based mascara with eyelash extensions  as this can loosen the adhesive.    invest in a high quality remover that requires that you rub as little as possible. use the makeup remover or pre moistened wipes to completely remove your makeup every day. avoid oil based makeup removers  which can loosen the adhesive. makeup must be removed very gently to avoid pulling off the extensions.           if you lose any pieces very early on  try to use a bit of mascara to conceal the gaps. a touch up every three to four weeks will keep your extensions looking full and at their best. you can also do maintenance as needed  adding new pieces on as you lose the originals.

query	224	hold tea mason jar date old ball mason jars  this is one of the earliest logos used by ball  back when the company was known as the ball brothers glass manufacturing company. because the jars were made in buffalo  new york  these are called buffalo jars today.   buffalo jars are rare and old. if you have a mason jar with this logo  it was manufactured between 1885 and 1886.    ball began using block letters for the logo on their jars in 1892  and continued using this type of logo until 1896. the major difference between the lettering on these jars and newer jars is the lettering on the older jars is simple printing rather than cursive or stylized lettering.  in 1895  ball introduced their first logo that used cursive lettering. this is also when ball began underlining their logo. between 1895 and 1896  the ball logo was relatively straight rather than angled toward the upper right side of the jar.    the ball logo has remained relatively standard since the first script logo was introduced  but there have been a number of small variations that can be used to date the jar. the 3 l logo  for instance  was only used between 1900 and 1910.   this logo is called the 3 l logo because the decorative loop at the end of the logo looks like a third l in the ball name.  between 1910 and 1923  the a in the word ball had an ascender at the beginning that looked like it should connect with the b. because the b and the a don t connect  this called the dropped a.   at this time  ball also adopted the 2 l style logo  where the decorative loop on the end of the name was dropped.    the cursive word  ball  without the underscore was only produced between 1923 and 1933.    this moves into the 1933 to 1962 age range. there is an underscore  a  b  with a loop in the center and a very small  a.     starting in the 1960s  the lower part of the  b  connected to the underline. this indicates a date range between 1960 and today.  ball mason jars with christmas lettering have a unique design that doesn t use their original printed or their traditional cursive lettering. instead  the lettering is calligraphy  and the jar reads  masons patent.    these ball mason jars were manufactured in 1890.  over the years  ball has introduced a variety of different jars that can be identified with certain words that are printed on the jars. some of these words were used for many years  but the style often changed every couple years.    improved   there were a few times when ball produced jars with  improved   including in the 1890s  when the jars were printed with  ball improved 1858.  later  the jars were produced with the wording  ball mason improved  between 1900 and 1933.  special   between 1910 and 1913  ball mason jars were printed with the words  ball special mason  in all block letters.  perfect   between 1913 and 1922  the word  perfect  was slightly offset  and is left indented from the word  mason  below. sanitary   this word was printed on ball mason jars around 1913 and 1915 to indicate that they had the sanitary sure seal. the word  sanitary  is in all capital letters  is italicized  and appears below the ball logo.  ideal   these were made between 1915 and 1962.  square   jars with the word  square  were produced in 1925.  eclipse   these wide mouthed jars were made between 1926 and 1952.    there are a few oddly sized ball mason jars that were produced at very specific times  so the size of the jar can be used to date its production.   in the 1920s and early 1930s  ball produced 40 ounce  1.2 l  jars that were used for coffee  and 42 ounce  1.24 l  jars that were popular with bootleggers.to measure the capacity of your jar  fill it with water and then measure the amount of water the jar holds.    ball created a number of colored mason jars over the years  and while the most common is blue  there were also jars produced in other colors as well  such as green and yellow.   blue glass ball jars were produced in the late 1890s and early 1900s  but the company stopped producing these in 1937. there were also some brown amber jars produced in the 1950s  but most of the jars produced after the 1940s were made of clear glass.  there have been a number of mason jars produced over the years that have spelling errors and other mistakes printed on the jars  and these can be compared with reference materials to date the jars. if you find a jar with an error  find a copy of the redbook  a price guide for fruit jar collectors  to determine the age and price of the jar based on the error.one of the most common error jars is a ball jar with a misspelling of the word  perfect   and common variations include  perffct    peprect   and  perefct.     ball jars that have an upside down logo are actually upside down jars that were designed to function as coffee dispensers. these were manufactured between 1900 and 1910.  ball mason jars were produced for many years with the year 1858 printed on them  but this is no indication of the age of jar itself. rather  1858 is the year that john mason was granted a patent for his mason jar design  and the ball company used this patent year on many jars.  this was another patent date that was printed on many mason jars  and that has no bearing on the year of production. in fact  ball used this patent date on their jars well into the 1930s  so this year cannot be used to accurately date a ball jar.  many ball mason jars have a number printed on the bottom of the jar  but this is a mold number that does not indicate the year of production. rather  the mold number tells you where the jar was positioned on the glass making machine that was used to produce it.   mold numbers are generally a number between zero and 15  and they ll sometimes have a letter included as well.
query	225	freeze refrigerator freeze lasagna  some ingredients taste better than others when they re reheated after being frozen. most lasagna recipes that call for fresh ingredients will be just fine after freezing  whether you freeze them unbaked or baked. however  if the recipe uses items that have already been frozen and thawed once  it s best not to freeze and thaw them twice. this increases the chance that the food could be contaminated by bacteria.   for example  don t plan on freezing lasagna made with sausage or ground beef that was previously frozen. instead  use fresh meat or leave it out completely. food that is frozen and thawed more than once also suffers when it comes to flavor and texture. choosing a recipe that calls for fresh ingredients will result in the best tasting lasagna. if your favorite lasagna recipe calls for a frozen ingredient  the final dish usually won t be too affected by substituting the fresh version instead. for example  instead of using frozen mushrooms  just use fresh. in most cases you will have needed to thaw them anyway.    look for a  freezer proof  label or be certain that the dish can be frozen as well as used for baking. most glass or ceramic casserole dishes are fine for this purpose.   avoid using an aluminum pan for long term storage of lasagna. the food might end up picking up a tinny taste. if you don t have a dish that can be used to both bake and freeze lasagna  you can bake it one dish and freeze it in a freezer safe food storage container.    lasagna that has been baked before freezing will still taste great after it has been reheated. lasagna that has been assembled and frozen before baking is delicious  too. use whichever method is most convenient for you  since the final texture and taste of the dish won t be too affected either way.   you might decide to freeze pre baked lasagna if you have leftovers after making a big batch. if you d rather freeze it before baking  consider making two lasagnas next time you re having lasagna for dinner. you can bake one and freeze the other to eat later.    if you want to freeze baked lasagna  it s necessary to make sure it has cooled entirely before you freeze it. otherwise  the texture of the dish won t be as pleasant when it s time to eat it. after making the lasagna  set it aside for one hour to cool. you can also place it into the refrigerator to chill. before placing it in the fridge  cover the lasagna with two layers of plastic wrap and one layer of kitchen foil.    don t use aluminum foil  since it might affect the taste of the lasagna. cover it with several layers of plastic wrap to keep it fresh in the freezer. you may want to wrap the plastic around the entire dish  rather than just over the top. that way  you can make sure there are no gaps in the wrap where air could get in and cause freezer burn.   consider cutting the lasagna into individual portions and freezing them in bags. this way you won t have to reheat the entire thing if you only need a meal for one or two people. cut the lasagna into serving sized portions after it has chilled. this will help the pieces hold together better instead of falling apart. put each piece in its own freezer safe storage bag. no matter what  make sure it is double wrapped to prevent the lasagna from drying out.    label it and place it in the freezer. it can be frozen for up to three months  whether it has a meat or vegetable filling.    the night before you intend to have the lasagna for dinner  thaw it overnight. if you try to bake it while it s still partially frozen  it will cook unevenly and the taste and texture will be affected. it will also be more difficult to determine whether it s done or not. you can thaw either the entire lasagna or portions in the refrigerator overnight.    this is the standard cooking temperature for lasagna. no matter what recipe you used  this is a good temperature for baking your lasagna to perfection.    unwrap all of the plastic wrap  and cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. this will keep the top from getting too brown while the rest of the lasagna cooks. if you re cooking an individual portion of lasagna  take the piece you want to bake out of its storage bag and place it on a suitable baking dish  then cover with foil.    put it in the oven and cook it half an hour to 40 minutes  or until heated through. you may need to test a small piece from the center to make sure it isn t still cold in the middle. during the last 10 minutes of baking  you can remove the foil to allow the heat to reach the top if you want a brown  crispy crust on your lasagna.   if you re just reheating an individual piece of lasagna  you can do it in the microwave instead of in the oven. place it on a microwave safe dish and microwave on high for 2   3 minutes  or until it s hot and bubbly. do not use aluminum foil in the microwave.    since it has been in the freezer for awhile  you might want to freshen it up by sprinkling some chipped basil or oregano on top.

your labrador retriever has not lost its pack instinct. most likely  your lab views you as the leader or one of the leaders of its pack. so if you neglect your lab  it will be affected emotionally.    all dogs are territorial. your lab is no exception. it s natural for them to bark at anything and everything  but when conditioned properly  they aren t so ferocious. make sure that you spend some time at home and out in public training your lab.if you have several dogs  you ll need to gradually introduce your new labrador retriever into the mix. place them in a room or outdoor space divided by a fence of some kind. let the dogs get a sense of one another. they learn a lot by smells  so give them 30 minutes or more to just take in their new companion. next  let them get closer  but keep them on a leash. do this several times  limiting their exposure to the other animal to half hour increments. only when you are confident that they won t attack one another should you let them roam freely. have them play together outside. let them bond.the same rules apply to people. if your labrador retriever is going to get used to being around a lot of people  it needs to be introduced into these environments in a safe way. keep your lab on a leash. have surrounding people strangers pet your dog and be kind to them. tell them to offer their hand to your dog. dogs love to smell people s hands in order to assess their scent. do this frequently. eventually  your lab will learn that people can be trusted.  generally  your labrador retriever will play well with children. however  if you have younger children  you will have to keep tabs on what they re doing with the dog at all times. make sure the child isn t hurting or threatening your dog in any way or this may result in a physical altercation. your dog isn t vicious. it doesn t hate your child. it might just feel threatened by it. if it scratches or bites  it is simply reacting instinctually to a threat. do your best to limit this threat. be present when your child plays with your labrador.  typically  your lab s favorite toy will be a tennis ball. this probably speaks to their inner  retriever . since your lab was bred to fetch wild game  it makes sense that it would enjoy playing with something that is meant to be retrieved. you can find a myriad of other toys at any pet superstore. dog toys are a great way for your dog to play and to burn off excess energy without having to go outside and run around.  teach it how to walk on a leash also. labrador retrievers are an intelligent breed and are often easy to train   especially  when they are younger. a trained dog is more confident and better behaved. in addition  a dog that will listen to voice commands is safer in the event it is ever off leash.when training your labrador retriever  be sure to reinforce positive behavior rather than chastise for negative. never hit your labrador retriever. you are trying to build a trusting relationship with your dog  not create a neurotic and scared animal. dogs that attack people or children without heed are often the product of cruel environments. don t let your labrador retriever be one of them.
