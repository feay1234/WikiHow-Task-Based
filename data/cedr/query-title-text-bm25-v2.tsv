roll dice third time try still unhappy score roll dice one time roll many dice want example say roll three rolled second turn get 2 score large straight however get another number still score small straight also fill one box upper level every player rolls dice 3 times 13 rounds go need try fill boxes box filled make wise choices terms choose count scores yahtzee game strategy chance steps take maximize chance yahtzee round remember first yahtzee additional yahtzee earns 100 points early game anytime chance yahtzee take settling lower score earlier score yahtzee better maximizes chance 100
