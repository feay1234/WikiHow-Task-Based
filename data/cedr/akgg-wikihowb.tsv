query	3	brainstorm small business ideas creative and entrepreneurial ideas for small businesses often come about after a series of brainstorming sessions brainstorming can be an effective way to think without limitations or restraint it works well when there are several people doing it together because it will allow you to bounce ideas back and forth and stimulate comments and consideration large companies and corporations often hire expensive consultants to imagine and develop their ideas small businesses may not have the same budgetary resources but they can still tap into the creativity of their leaders brainstorm small business ideas by getting smart and creative people together to share thoughts on how you can initiate and maintain a successful new business setting up your brainstorming session developing ideas focusing your idea define the objective of your brainstorming session come up with a starting point decide what you want from your business idea brainstorm with a group of people set up your brainstorming location research relevant subject matter think independently question market assumptions honor all suggestions and ideas ask questions document your brainstorming session repeat your brainstorming session assess your ideas define all the factors and details that need to be considered choose the best idea create a business plan get started you need to know what you hope to gain from brainstorming whether you hope to clarify a business model come up with a business idea or product or find a solution to a customer need you have to be absolutely clear about the purpose of your discussions what do you want to have at the end a completed business plan a product design write this objective down and place it prominently in your brainstorming space to keep you and your team on track regardless of whether or not you have an actual business idea yet you need a starting point from which your other brainstorming ideas can flow small business ideas typically start as something the founder notices like some kind of unmet need in his or her community or an idea that they have to improve a process these can be sudden insights or the result of noticing small things through years of work in a certain industry or profession whatever idea you have that has caused you to bring people together and think up a small business define it and then move forward from there it is also important to clearly and succinctly define the starting point or the impetus for the brainstorming session so that everyone is focused on the same input and outcome the most successful companies started with a combination of a recognized need in the market and a new technology for example google combined people s need to find things easily online with their proprietary search technology a good starting place could be either one or both of these two parts your starting point doesn t necessarily have to be a solid business or product idea instead it can be a goal like making money creating a unique product or gaining market share this is more difficult to start with as you have no guidance on deciding what exactly your future business will do or make however this also opens up limitless possibilities and even if you do have a solid idea determining what you want from your business can help you with long term planning do not invite people who will think the same way as you successful brainstorming comes from different opinions and perspectives allow these people to share their own viewpoints problems and experiences for example you could brainstorm with small business experts or set up a meeting with a mentor or a business leader who you respect and admire pitch your ideas to the expert and welcome any feedback be willing to hear positive comments and negative criticism express your gratitude to everyone who helped few people brainstorm on their own so be sure to say thanks to the team who brainstormed with you time is a valuable resource and people will appreciate your acknowledgement of their help and insight your brainstorming location is almost as important as the team that you select make sure to choose a relatively quiet location free of outside distractions or noise then remove all electronic devices from the room except for computers used for research provides team members with individual notepads to write down ideas have a whiteboard chalkboard or large pad in a central location to keep track of everyone s ideas consider playing music to enhance creative thought try using classical music without words provide drinks like water or coffee to keep your team hydrated and focused it may help your team to get out of the area where you usually meet like going on a retreat or simply going outside to a park changing your surroundings can help you see new perspectives and change your thought patterns read articles search the internet and watch videos about subjects that are relevant to the business ideas you are brainstorming the more information you have the better decisions you can make you should also look at any past attempts you or anyone else has made to solve the problem you are addressing or fix the product you are focused on what did they do right where did their attempt go wrong bringing this type of context to your discussions can help shape your own ideas learn about the industry you are hoping to get into look at its organization major players and relevant government regulations you can also reach out to business connections of yours who are involved in this industry to get their thoughts on certain aspects of the market have your group members brainstorm the idea individually and then collect their notes in a google doc or dropbox folder then have everyone review everyone else s ideas individually and come up with new thoughts finally come together as a group and share these new ideas that way you start off with a broader base of ideas many successful startups are disruptive in that they offer something completely new to the market that eventually changes how that market functions think about uber or airbnb which have perfected new solutions to common problems these were solutions that no one was sure would work in practice and that stood against the current status quo of their respective markets to start try breaking down a consumer need or imperfect product into it s essence what service is being provided ignore current solutions to think of news ways that the problem can be solved address current assumptions about that product or service directly by writing them down then think of ways around those assumptions or ways to replace them some successful new companies simply make a change to the prevailing business model of their industries not necessarily changing the product offerings or need addressed don t focus so much on your offering that you forget the potential benefits of a better business model brainstorming cannot work if limitations are put on the creative process treat every idea by each member of the brainstorming idea the same way developing it and asking questions until it is either deemed impractical or it graduates to the good idea list agree to consider all ideas regardless of how impossible they seem in fact coming up with terrible ideas can be beneficial to your creative process try coming up with the worst ideas you can think of illegal impractical or expensive ideas then try to change those ideas to make them better ideas this process can help you think of your problem in new ways brainstorming requires that you ask specific and general questions about every aspect of each idea try to ask questions that force your team to consider alternatives rethink assumptions or continue with their current train of thought leave your questions open ended and allow your team members ample time to think and respond assign a group member to be the secretary or scribe for the meeting have them record everything discussed ideas that you choose to move forward with and your progress or stopping point this will allow you to pick up where you left off when you have your next session it s not likely that you will come up with your million dollar idea on your first try be persistent and meet regularly with your brainstorming group or with different groups to come up with new ways of thinking your idea may come to you in a later session or at a completely unexpected time just make sure to save your notes from previous sessions so that you don t lose any progress be sure to evaluate your process when you finish your brainstorming take some time to note what worked well and what did not work for you in coming up with small business ideas this will help you in future brainstorming and strategy sessions the best ideas are useless if you can t see a way to develop them into a fully functioning business when you ve come up with several of them through brainstorming assess your ideas using the following criteria are you the right person to build on this idea do you have the experience or technical know how required to solve this problem better than your competitors will customers want this product or service a product can be useful in theory but not enough to make customers actually pay for it does this idea solve a problem that the customer has does it do so effectively and efficiently is the market ready consider your potential competitors and the barriers to entry that they may present also think about whether there are enough prospective customers to keep your business afloat consider your operations can you make a business structure to build or provide this product or service more importantly can you gather the capital required to develop and build it be prepared for the challenges and opportunities that come with the small business ideas you are brainstorming for example think about the following the money you will need to start brainstorm how much capital will be required to start your small business talk through the best ways to raise that money whether through loans or investors the logistical factors that are involved list the operational aspects of your small business that will need attention including staff inventory physical space for the business and marketing costs your timeline figure out how much time it will take to start the small business and turn it into a success your long term plan figure out what needs to be done first then the next steps after that the best idea can be chosen according to a few important criteria first assess the cost can you come up with the money needed to pursue this idea then consider your business s ability to create this product or service do you have the expertise capability and capacity needed finally look for a competitive advantage in your ideas can you create this idea faster better or more cheaply than your competitors only once an idea passes these criteria should you move forward with it once you have completed your brainstorming and you have a vision for your small business write it down this will be an abbreviated business plan which is simply a framework for your business with as much information as your currently have rather than a full business plan start with a one sentence description of your idea what do you do and what will the effect of this product or service be then write a short description of this product or service using the information you have thus far write out what you know about your business organization such as your management structure distribution model and pricing plan determine what it might cost to develop and produce your product or prepare to provide your service include all potential start up costs then include what you know about the market from competitors and market share to trends and potential customer base the only way to know if your business plan will work is to try it start asking around to your colleagues and connections to form a team to make your idea happen begin networking with people to the industry you are trying to enter come up with ways to finance your business most importantly continually refine your idea or product until it is good enough to take to market 
query	4	change a chain on a mountain bike no matter how cheap or expensive your bicycle is there will come a day when you need to fix or replace its chain the structure of a mountain bike may be more complex than the structure of a regular bike but the chain changing process is similar with the right tools and a little bit of patience you ll have a new chain on your bike in no time removing the chain attaching your new chain inspecting your chain for wear secure your bike check for a master link position your chain clean the chain remove the chain avoid using failed chains as replacements measure your replacement chain insert your chain into the gear mechanism attach the loose ends of your chain remove extra links from the chain if necessary prevent chain binding for full suspension bikes test your chain evaluate the wear on your chain try to join the ends of your chain to test wear alternatively familiarize yourself with the drivetrain it s unlikely that your kickstand will be sufficient for you to get a good look at your bike without it falling over a bike rack that has hooks from which you can hang your bike works very well but you can also turn your bike upside down so it rests on the seat and handlebars inspecting your chain with your bike s wheels facing upwards will make it more comfortable for you to inspect and work on you can make a simple bike rack with scrap parts all you ll need are hooks and a frame insert hooks into 2 x 4 boards oriented vertically and attach those boards to a sturdy base separating each board by the distance between the hubs of the wheels a master link is a special link in your bike chain that has a pin slot configuration that will allow you to easily remove your chain from the bike two popular kinds of master link are connex and sram powerlink knowing where your master link is ahead of time will make chain replacement go smoother if your bike does not have a master link you can install one yourself or have it done at your local bike shop this installation is usually inexpensive costing about 15 in most cases if your bike does not have a master link and you prefer not to have one installed you can use a special tool called a chain tool to remove the chain this is especially important if you have a master link removing a master link that s positioned on the teeth of the chain ring or a gear can be very difficult positioning the master link so it is suspended at the midpoint between wheels will be easiest if you are using a chain tool you can still benefit from proper chain positioning some parts of your chain will be dirtier or have more wear than others a clear segment of chain positioned at the midpoint between the wheels will be easiest to remove with your chain tool bike chains are greased to improve their performance and prevent the elements from causing the chain the degrade quickly it s likely that a layer of gunk has accumulated on your chain clean this with a rag that s been dampened with degreaser and wipe free the buildup and grease to gain access to the full length of chain move the pedals with your hands to rotate it through the drivetrain until an uncleaned section of chain is available if you lack chain degreaser isopropyl alcohol rubbing alcohol or paint thinner both work well as a substitute now that the chain is in position you can remove it with a master link you can do this by squeezing both ends of the master link inwards with your hands or a pair of small pliers so the pin comes out of its slot and the link comes apart freeing your chain if using a chain tool you should set the chain tool on the link you are trying to remove so it aligns with one of the round holes to either side of the link screw the chain tool so it moves through the hole this will push out the pin that is keeping that link together try not to push the pin completely free of the link this will make it difficult or in some cases impossible to reassemble that link of the chain you ll often feel a popping or snapping when the pin pushes free of the link this is a good indicator that the link has been disengaged some chain tools are only intended for certain sized links though some can be used on several different sizes of chain check the instructions on your chain tool before using it chains generally fail because they have reached their limit or been put under too much stress replacing a failed chain on your bike could result in an even more severe failure down the road to prevent injury to yourself or your mountain bike you should buy a new chain instead of reusing old ones bike chains can be bought at your local bike shop or in some cases your local hardware store it s important that you only use the kind of chain intended for your bike for example an 11 speed bike will use an 11 speed chain hang your old bike chain so it dangles freely and do the same with your new chain beside the old one count the number of links your new chain is longer than the old this will be the number of links you need to remove if your chain has snapped and it is unreliable to measure your new chain you can remove links after feeding the chain into the drivetrain of your bike for more complex mountain bike you may need to consult the picture you took of how the old chain feeds through the gear mechanism to do this properly simple mechanisms may be more intuitive pull the chain through the entire drivetrain until both ends terminate at either the top or bottom midpoint between your wheels positioning the ends of your chain at the midpoint between the wheels of your bike will make it more accessible which will make the reattachment easier with a master link all you need to do is slip the pin of the link into its slot to complete the link if you removed your chain with a chain tool you ll have to re couple the split link by lining up its halves together and using a pair of pliers to force the pin back through the hole to complete the link you should feel a click or a pop when the pin of a master link slides into place you can also pull on the chain to either side of the link to securely seat the pin of the master link in place if you were not able to measure and shorten your chain beforehand you should notice that your chain hangs somewhat loosely in your drivetrain for the best ride you ll need the chain to be strung tautly between the wheels in its lowest gear if your chain is loose you ll need to remove some links this is likely the case if you were not able to measure your chain shift your bike to its lowest gear and then use your chain tool to remove links one at a time to shorten the chain until it is taut in the drivetrain when removing extra links avoid popping the pin holding them together completely free of the link this will make it difficult to reattach the link if you shorten it too much as your suspension compresses the chain of your bike will adjust this can cause chain binding and make your bike difficult to ride take your bike off its rack and then vent the compression element from your shock or disengage it this can usually done with the press of a button on the shocks of your bike bike shocks are generally be located on the front frame of your bike around where the frame of your bike forks to the wheel press down on the seat of your bike firmly until the suspension is fully engaged when your bike can compress no further your suspension is fully engaged if your chain remains taut your bike is good to go if however you notice the chain loosens you ll likely have to remove another link or two if it resists the compression of your bike s suspension you may need to add a link reposition your bike back on its rack and move the pedals manually with your hands to run the chain through the drivetrain of your bicycle the chain should move smoothly if you notice stiff links these are often caused by a protruding link pin and can be fixed by resetting the pin with your chain tool and pliers to protect your chain from the elements and to help it run smoothly in your drive train you should lubricate your chain with a suitable bicycle chain lubricant the most reliable way of doing this is with a chain wear indicator which you should be able to purchase at your local bike shop or maybe even at a hardware store you ll have to attach the indicator between the links of your chain and follow the directions on it to interpret its reading most chain wear indicators will have a sticker that establishes the values for a worn chain and an unworn chain if your wear indicator does not check the box it came in for these values if you do not have a wear indicator you can perform a hand check of the chain use moderate pressure to lift a section of your chain from the chainring of your bike with your fingers a small gap should form between the chain and the ring if you can clearly see through the gap over three or four teeth your chain is worn if inspecting your chain with a wear indicator or a physical gap check aren t an option or if your chain is already off the bike you can also check for wear by trying to touch the ends of the bike chain lay your chain on a clean surface so that the holes in the chain are oriented up and down then try to touch the ends of the chain together while keeping the holes facing up and down over time chains are bent by the action of your bikes derailleur note the amount of sideways flex in your chain a worn chain will have a great deal flexion newer chains resist touching and only arc slightly the drivetrain of your bike is the part that transfer the energy you put into the pedals through the chain to your gears to move the wheels you ll want to pay extra close attention to how the chain feeds into the gears knowing how the chain fits in the mechanism will allow you to replace it with greater ease you might want to snap a few pictures of the gear mechanism s on your bike with your phone before removing the chain you can consult these pictures later on if you re having difficulty reattaching the chain

contact your state s attorney general s office and ask if the company has been sued check the better business bureau look in the city where the company has its headquarters pay attention to any complains about the company not everyone with a lawsuit qualifies for legal funding instead the company will analyze the strength of your case they will only advance funds if they think you can win

example you might win a 200 000 settlement your lawyer could take 40 of that leaving you with 120 000 a legal funding company might fund 5 10 of the claim this means you could pay another 20 000 plus interest which will reduce your take home amount to 100 000 or less consider whether you have other options for example friends or family might let you move in with them or give you an interest free loan which you can pay back after you receive your settlement before applying to a legal funding company you should talk to someone and ask questions you want to understand the agreement you are entering for example you may want to ask the following will you be charged a start up fee are there other hidden fees what percentage of your lawsuit will they fund how large of a cash advance can you get how much interest will you be charged generally consumers are charged an annual interest rate of 51 156 this can add up quickly when do you have to pay the legal funding company immediately after receiving your settlement do you have to make monthly interest payments does the company provide any additional services for litigation cost funding the company may provide a case assessment contact the legal funding company and ask how to apply some companies let you apply online generally you will be asked for the following information personal information name contact info etc state where your case is filedtype of case persona injury civil rights etc name of your lawyerlawyer s contact information make sure to thoroughly read the contract before signing don t sign unless you agree with

bleach or any of the other ingredients to do a patch allergy test apply a dab of bleach solution on a patch of skin behind your ear leave the bleach on for 24 48 hours and check for any allergic reaction such as a rash itching or burning on that spot if you do have an allergic reaction however mild you should try a different method for bleaching your hair read the instructions that came with the bleach powder to find out exactly how much to use usually you mix one part bleach with two parts toner but the instructions will give you precise measurements mix these in an old bowl with an old spoon or spatula that you will not be putting back into your kitchen the mixture will be blue or bluish white add the red gold color corrector if you re going for a more platinum look pay close attention to the instructions on the label to ensure your measurements and proportions are exact peroxide can stain clothing and can be irritating to skin so take care to cover yourself properly wear gloves and cover your clothes with an old towel apply a small amount of petroleum jelly along your hairline and neckline to protect your skin never apply bleach without gloves the chemicals can burn your skin gather up a small hunk of hair from the nape of your neck spray the peroxide onto this strand starting at the roots and working it towards the ends leave it in for about 20 30 minutes rinse out the peroxide and check the color against a white towel this will enable you to check if you like the color before dousing your entire head in peroxide it will also help you gauge how much time to leave in the peroxide divide your hair into a few sections and twist the sections up clip these sections into easily removable hair clips it s best to use hair clips you can put in and take out with only one hand especially after you start the bleaching process don t clip the first section you plan to bleach make sure your hair is completely dry before you begin use the tint brush to apply the bleach keep the hair that has not been bleached separate from the hair that has been bleached so you can keep track of where you re at use clips or squares of foil to separate sections of your hair depending on the style you re going for you can use use the tint brush to apply the bleach in different ways including roots to tips tips to roots etc don t rub the bleach into your head since the chemicals can burn your scalp to get salon quality highlights separate out small sections of your hair that are less than an inch wide place foil squares under these sections to protect the rest of your hair from receiving any of the peroxide spray spray these sections and wrap them in the foil sheets to keep them from touching the rest of your hair while you let the peroxide sit in your hair highlighting your hair is probably easiest to do with a friend helping you it can be a good idea to just apply bleach to the front section of your hair allow it to process and rinse before doing the back section putting the bleach mixture over your whole head takes time and you may not have enough time to finish the back section before the front section needs to be rinsed out cover your hair with plastic wrap let the bleach start working on your hair the longer you leave it in the lighter your hair will be keep checking a strand of hair every 10 minutes until you re satisfied with the color of your hair don t leave the bleach in your hair for more than 45 minutes total several factors including the volume of your developer and the darkness of your hair influence how long it will take for the bleach to lift your hair color to the lightness you desire rinse out all of the bleach with cool water then use the special shampoo for bleached hair dry your hair and check out the color if you like the color you can stop there style your hair normally be aware of the different hues that a bleach job will give you depending on your hair color dark brown hair will lighten to chestnut brown but too much peroxide may result in an orange brown color medium brown will turn to light brown light brown will turn dark blond red hair will turn orange and with enough bleaching will become strawberry blond dark blond will turn light blond some people will need to tone their hair to achieve a nice white blond color or to even out some of the color imperfections that their hair has after bleaching this may not work for everyone however and can result in white gray hair that you may not like the stage for adding toner comes in after you have fully bleached your hair and you will not be trying to bleach your hair further you should have also already washed and dried your hair so that you can assess the color that your hair has become use an old mixing bowl and old spatula and put in the correct parts toner developer and red gold corrector be sure to check the instructions on the box to get the correct proportions and measurements dry your hair at least a little bit with a towel use a clean tinting brush to apply toner to your hair in sections using clips or pieces of tin foil to separate sections that have toner on them from those that still need an application applying the toner is not as time sensitive as the bleach application stage so you can take your time a little more now this varies depending on the product you are using but 30 minutes is about the norm wait until the toner turns a dark purple in your hair check your hair after about 15 minutes to see how it looks by wiping off some of the purple toner keep checking every 10 minutes until you have reached the color you want rinse your hair under cool water until all traces of the toner are gone cool water is better than warm water since it stops the developing process which will stop the chemicals from removing more color from your hair purple shampoo is a type of toning shampoo that is used to help distribute purple pigment to counteract brassy hues in your hair by adding a little bit of purple pigment to your hair you neutralize some of the reds and yellows in bleached hair bringing out some blue hues and making your hair a slightly cooler color rinse your hair in hot water briefly so that the hair shafts open and are ready to absorb more of the purple hue apply shampoo liberally to your hair let it sit for up to 5 minutes and then rinse with cool water the cool water will seal up the hair shafts and help retain the purple tones in your hair make sure you rinse it out completely however because it will stain towels and it can potentially leave your hair a lavender color if you have white blond hair there are several different brands and prices for these from clairol professional shimmer lights shampoo for about 10 per bottle to unite blonda toning shampoo for about 30 your best bet is to purchase this type of shampoo at a beauty supplies store talk to a sales clerk for advice on the best shampoo for your hair your hair will be brittle and dry after this treatment and will need deep conditioning to restore some moisture and elasticity use a deep conditioner store bought or natural at least once a week leaving it in your hair for 20 30 minutes and then rinsing it out results can be improved by heating up your hair with a hair dryer while the deep conditioner is in place if you have made your own deep conditioner with food check to make sure it hasn t gone bad if it s been mixed up for longer than a few days or a week if kept in the refrigerator throw it away and mix up a new batch hydrogen peroxide is a chemical compound that serves many household uses from cleaning cuts to disinfecting countertops to removing stains it can also be used to bleach your hair hydrogen peroxide is readily available at grocery or drug stores costing just a couple of dollars for a 32 ounce 910 g bottle make sure the peroxide strength is no greater than 3 by double checking the bottle s label of active ingredients a stronger solution than this can severely damage your hair this step seems time consuming especially when you want to get started on bleaching your hair but it is an important step that will save you a serious skin rash or worse if you happen to be allergic to the bleach or any of the other ingredients to do a patch allergy test apply a dab of bleach on a patch of skin behind your ear leave the bleach on for 24 48 hours and check for any allergic reaction such as a rash itching or burning on that spot if you do have an allergic reaction however mild you should ty a different method for bleaching your hair use a clean spray bottle or a recycled one that has been thoroughly washed and dried this will help you aim your spray more evenly and accurately when applying it to your hair gather some cotton balls to aid in a more precise application do a few test squirts to make sure the spray bottle is functioning properly peroxide can stain clothing and can be irritating to skin so take care to cover yourself properly wear gloves and cover your clothes with an old towel apply a small amount of petroleum jelly along your hairline and neckline to protect your skin wet your hair with lukewarm water and pat it dry with a towel let it air dry for a few minutes until it s still damp but not dripping wet use hair clips to section your hair divide your hair into a few sections and twist the sections up clip these sections into easily removable hair clips it s best to use hair clips you can put in and take out with only one hand especially after you start the bleaching process don t clip the first section you plan to bleach you can also apply melted coconut oil to your hair before bleaching to help protect your hair to melt the coconut oil place the sealed jar into hot water this will liquefy the oil pour the oil all over your head and rub it into your hair wrap your hair in a plastic cap and let the oil soak into your hair for a few hours overnight is best do not rinse your hair before applying the bleach gather up a small hunk of hair from the nape of your neck spray the peroxide onto this strand starting at the roots and working it towards the ends leave it in for about 20 30 minutes rinse out the peroxide and check the color against a white towel this will enable you to check if you like the color before dousing your entire head in peroxide it will also help you gauge how much time to leave in the peroxide be aware of the different hues that a bleach job will give you depending on your hair color dark brown hair will lighten to chestnut brown but too much peroxide may result in an orange brown color medium brown will turn to light brown light brown will turn dark blond red hair will turn orange and with enough bleaching will become strawberry blond dark blond will turn light blond dampen the first section of your hair by spraying it with peroxide from the spray bottle make sure to spray it from all sides the more peroxide solution you use on your hair the lighter your hair will get be careful to only spray directly onto your hair not your scalp the peroxide may irritate your skin go slowly paying careful attention to how your hair is reacting to the peroxide as you progress when the first section is damp unclip a second section and spray it with peroxide repeat until all of your hair has been treated if you want to highlight a few strands of hair rather than spraying your entire head dip a cotton ball in the peroxide and rub it on the strands you wish to die to bleach streaks in your hair separate out the chunks that you want to bleach place foil squares under these chunks to protect the rest of your hair from receiving any of the peroxide spray spray these chunks and wrap them in the foil sheets to keep them from touching the rest of your hair while you let the peroxide sit in your hair streaking your hair is probably easiest to do with a friend helping you the longer you leave the peroxide in the brighter your hair will become be careful not to let the peroxide sit in your hair for more than 45 minutes if the peroxide begins irritating your scalp wash it out right away using a hair dryer on your hair or another heater during this process may speed up the time it takes to reach your desired color even though the hair dryer will speed the process be aware that the heat can damage your hair and could cause hair damage this is not necessary however and if you are not sure how your hair reacts to peroxide you should skip this heating step use cool water to remove all traces of peroxide from your hair then use a deep conditioner to restore its moisture allow your hair to dry then style as usual if this first round has not left you with the color that you re aiming for you can bleach your hair with peroxide again it s advisable to wait a week between treatments however to give your hair time to recover the bleaching process is highly damaging to your hair and if you bleach your hair two or more times in one day or even in one week you risk causing serious damage to your hair meaning your hair might even fall out most hairstylists are trained in how to properly bleach hair but some may be more skilled at it than others schedule a brief consultation with your hairstylist so you can strategize how you might want to bleach your hair ask your hairstylist how often they ve bleached hair how they ve handled different types of hair etc also ask for their recommendations on how to handle your hair and how they think your hair will react to the bleaching process you should also ask if your hair is healthy enough to bleach some colorists won t bleach hair that has already been color treated because it is such a damaging process bleached hair does still have variety in terms of hues you can choose white hair white blond platinum blond or a few other hues bring in a picture of someone with the same shade of hair that you d like this will help your hairstylist figure out the best approach to bleaching your hair the bleaching process is a slow process and does not happen instantly the hairstylist needs time to wash your hair mix up the bleach solution and apply it to your hair it needs to sit in your hair for a while 30 minutes or so then your hairstylist needs to wash it out and dry your hair you may need to schedule a second session with your hairstylist if you have very dark hair and you want to go white blond your hairstylist is also skilled at bleaching highlights into your hair it is also much easier for another person to do this process rather than trying to do it yourself they can see your head from above and can apply bleaching solution evenly over your head your hair will be brittle and dry after this treatment and will need deep conditioning to restore some moisture and elasticity use a deep conditioner store bought or natural at least once a week leaving it in your hair for 20 30 minutes and then rinsing it out results can be improved by heating up your hair with a hair dryer while the deep conditioner is in place if you have made your own deep conditioner with food items check to make sure it hasn t gone bad if it s been mixed up for longer than a few days or a week if kept in the refrigerator throw it away and mix up a new batch depending on how long your hair is and how much of it you want to bleach you ll need the juice of 2 to 5 lemons cut the lemons in half and use a juicer or your hands to squeeze their juice into a bowl strain the seeds when you re finished juicing don t use lemon juice that comes in a bottle it contains preservatives that may damage your hair pouring full strength lemon juice on your hair can really dry it out so it s important to dilute the juice with water add an amount of water to the bowl that s equal to the amount of lemon juice it s best to use a new spray bottle which can be purchased at most drug stores but you can also recycle one you already have at home if you re using a recycled spray bottle make sure it is completely clean wash it out with soap and water before you fill it with the lemon juice solution shake the lemon juice solution well and do a few test squirts to make sure the spray bottle is functioning properly spray the area you want to bleach liberally with lemon juice solution making sure the area is completely damp spray more lemon juice in the areas that you want to lighten the most the more lemon juice you use the lighter it will get if you want to highlight a few strands of hair instead of bleaching it all over use a cotton ball to rub lemon juice solution on the parts that you do want to bleach the sun will react with the lemon juice and cause your hair to lighten wait for all the lemon juice solution to completely dry in your hair for about 30 minutes be sure to cover yourself with sunscreen and clothing to protect yourself from the sun s rays as you bleach your hair remember that this process can dry out your hair sitting in the sun for a long time will help your hair get lighter but it will also cause some damage after the lemon juice solution has dried wash it out with shampoo and then condition your hair with a good moisturizing conditioner style it as usual once your hair is dry take a look at the color if you want it to be even lighter repeat the process again in a few days don t bleach your hair with lemon juice more often than once every two or three weeks

look at the types of damages covered by your policy avoid negligent driving in order to maximize the amount that the insurance company will pay for your claim it is very important to pay attention at the scene of the car accident getting into a car accident is a stressful situation but try to stay calm if you or the other driver is injured help as much as you can until paramedics arrive while you are not typically required by law to give it it is possible that an injured party could sue you for not helping them if it turns out that the accident is your fault call 911 or make sure that the other driver or a witness has called the police speak with the police and provide an honest statement about what happened often insurance adjusters will talk to police officers if there is any question on fault not calling the police to the scene could reduce your insurance claim amount even if you believe that the accident is completely their fault do not yell or argue with the other driver arguing with the other driver or letting your anger get the best of you will not fix your car instead it might make the other driver angry enough to blame the accident on you the other driver also might not cooperate with the insurance company if you want to be compensated by the other driver you must get the following information the other driver s name and driver s license number the other driver s vehicle type and license plate number the name of the other driver s car insurance company andthe other driver s insurance policy number usually after a car accident two or more insurance companies will potentially be involved in the claims process there will be an insurance company for each driver that was involved in the accident make sure that the other driver s policy isn t expired if the insurance policy is not under the driver s name get the insurance policy holder s name and contact information you will use this contact information to get in touch with the other driver s car insurance company then you will be able to start a car accident claim as soon as possible after the accident write down an account of the accident make notes on how you believe the accident happened and any other details you remember from the crash for example make sure that you write down the road conditions at the time of the accident and exactly what you were doing when the accident occurred i e i was stopped at a stop sign when the other car rear ended me take pictures of the scene you can show these to your insurance company later use your phone or get your camera if you don t have access to either of these ask a witness to take pictures find people who saw the accident can confirm your story ask for the witnesses to give you or the police a statement get contact information from the witnesses to use if necessary get checked by a doctor to document any injuries you may have received in the accident even if you don t think you ve been injured you should verify with a doctor most major insurance companies use a software system called colossus to determine your claim s value the colossus system is largely based on the contents of your medical records and assign severity points to your injuries to determine how much you are entitled to broken bones and other easy to verify injuries are given a higher value soft tissue damage such as sprains and strains are given a lower value if you do not go to the hospital immediately after the accident your claim will be given lower value the insurance company may ask you to visit a doctor of their choosing you don t need to visit their recommended doctor in fact you probably shouldn t see someone who may be biased in favor of the insurance company certain types of injuries will increase your settlement the colossus software will also take these into account these include muscle spasmsdizzinessradiating painheadachesrestriction of movementnauseavision impairmentneurosisdepressionanxiety after your accident make sure you keep careful documentation about all medical treatments you receive treatments by specialists are given a higher value by the insurance company s colossus software system document all physical therapy getting physical therapy for a period of 1 90 days is considered 1 3 months of treatment when you have at least 91 days you will be considered as receiving 3 6 months of treatment the longer the treatment the higher the settlement value keep track of all medications the colossus system takes medication into account when determining settlement value it is important to document any costs or expenses that occurred as a result of the accident keep all documentation in order including receipts reports and estimates put papers together in a file so that when you need them they are easy to find keep track of claim numbers and people with whom you have spoken include missed work and medical costs these should be part of the total settlement you receive so include every related expense this documentation can take the form of medical records or work excuses from your doctor or work supervisor if you plan to claim an expense as part of the damages or loss from your accident you will need to provide documentation of the expense to begin your claim call your insurance company and inform the representative that you are filing a claim this can be done after you get home from the accident you can wait until the next day if necessary you will be connected with a car insurance claims adjuster or liability examiner if you live in one of the twelve states with no fault auto insurance you ll almost always deal directly with your insurance company these states are florida hawaii kansas kentucky massachusetts michigan minnesota new jersey new york north dakota pennsylvania and utah check your policy to be sure what kind of insurance you have keep in mind that the adjuster or examiner works for the insurance company it is in their job duty and interest to save money for their company so they are not looking out for you you need to look out for you each claims adjuster will negotiate with each other to get the best settlement possible for their insurance company therefore your claims representative will be trying to shift blame for the accident onto the other party at the same time they are trying to reduce the amount of your settlement if the claim will be paid entirely by the other driver s insurance company your claims adjuster will probably be much more helpful during the claims process tell the person that you speak with that you are going to file a claim you should also say that you will speak to the adjuster when the investigation into the accident is complete when you call the insurance company tell them that you are starting a claim do not give an exhaustive description of the accident however if the other driver was clearly at fault in the accident it is appropriate to briefly explain the circumstances for instance you can tell the adjuster that the other driver ran a red light in this case your insurance company can contact the insurance company that covers the other driver and being building a claim against the other driver often the insurance company will want to catch you off guard so you make a statement that might not help you for example if you immediately disclose the identity of the witnesses to the accident the insurance company could go and speak to them and pressure them into changing their statements you will not know whether you are injured until you see a doctor even if you don t think that you were hurt do not tell the insurance adjuster if you discover later that you do have an injury from the crash the insurance adjuster can hold you to your past statement instead tell the insurance adjuster that you are unsure about the extent of any injuries tell them that you will go to a doctor to get checked out an insurance company may want to go through your medical records to blame any injuries that you may have on something other than the car accident even if you think that you may be slightly at fault in the accident do not say that to the insurer when you call them the blame for the accident has not been determined yet if you make a statement indicating that you may be the one at fault it could be used against you by the insurance company at a later time this likely won t matter if you live in one of the no fault auto insurance states still it can t hurt to avoid admitting to fault refrain from estimating what you think the damages from the accident may be if you estimate how much it will cost to repair your car this is what the insurance company will offer you if your repairs cost more the company will not give you more the insurance company may suggest cheaper alternatives to repair your car which will lower your overall settlement value make sure you get estimates for the same parts that were damaged on your car not these cheaper alternatives if you do not live in a no fault state you may choose to choose to speak with the insurance company for the other driver you may do so in order to find out the terms of the other driver s insurance policy this way you will have a better idea of what you re dealing with if the other driver doesn t have insurance you may be able to get coverage from uninsured motorist coverage in most situations the claims adjusters for both your insurance company and the other driver s insurance company will want to interview you the adjuster will ask you questions about the accident this interview may happen over the phone if there is a local office you might have an interview in person before you have your interview with the insurance company write down what happened in the accident this way you will be able to clearly communicate your views without getting flustered by questions from the claims adjuster bring any paperwork receipts or other documentation that you have gathered relating to the accident if you re talking over the phone make sure to have all documentation handy get the name and direct number for the person who is assigned to your claim you will be talking to this person about your claim so you should try to get to know them knowing this person s contact information will allow you to check on the status of your claim even though dealing with an insurance company especially after a car accident can be stressful be sure to remain polite angering the person who is handling your insurance claim can slow down the settlement process this may reduce your chances for a large settlement you want the insurance adjuster to be on your side at the very least don t give him a reason to place your claim at the bottom of the pile each car accident is different and presents different circumstances so insurance companies do not have a precise mathematical formula that they use to determine the settlement amount however there are certain factors that the insurance company considers when determining a settlement value when talking with your claims adjuster describe these factors in your favor these factors include the type and nature of the property damage from the accident talk about how your car was damaged by the other driver s negligence whether or not an injury is involved talk about your own injuries medications and therapies to learn more about how an insurance company calculates settlement values read how to calculate an auto insurance settlement during the settlement process the fault of the accident has not been allocated however the insurance company may try to ask questions that force you to admit that the accident was your fault being found to be at fault for a car accident will increase the costs of your insurance payments going forward even though your insurance company will pay for the costs of the accident for example the company may ask you something like how could you have avoided the accident you should respond the accident could not have been avoided because the other driver hit my car when i was stopped or something similar that fits with your situation if you are responsible in any way for the accident the evidence will show this but don t assume you are responsible from the outset this will lower the value of your settlement focus your answers on the other driver in the accident this will help you avoid blaming questions instead emphasizing the other driver s conduct for example don t say driver x and i were in a car accident instead say driver x hit my car when i was stopped at the intersection if the adjuster asks you questions that you do not know the answers to simply communicate that do not speculate about the cause of the accident if you don t know an answer or don t remember something from the accident just say i m not sure or i don t remember it is likely that the insurance company could offer you a settlement quickly in hopes that you do not realize the extent of your possible damages while settling quickly may save you some convenience you may end up paying out of pocket if the settlement doesn t fully cover your medical bills car repairs or other costs from the accident do not accept a settlement until you know for sure what all of your costs will be if the insurance company offers you a settlement right away ask that they mail the offer in writing this way you will still have to agree to the settlement later you won t feel pressured to make a split second decision if the settlement offered by the insurance company does not cover your medical or other expenses and your car repairs consider hiring a personal injury attorney this person can help you negotiate with the insurance company she can also help you file a lawsuit against the driver who was at fault in your accident get a referral to a personal injury lawyer by asking friends or family find a personal injury lawyer by asking other attorneys for recommendations if you have an attorney your claims adjuster will use the colossus software system to factor in the number of successful cases the lawyer has had against the insurance companies your settlement amount might increase if the attorney has been successful many times before check with your local bar association which has free referral services that include a free consultation with an attorney while it may be tempting to hurry your settlement along rushing can result in a lower settlement you may not receive the full amount of compensation to which you are entitled make sure you take care of yourself and address any medical issues relating to your accident before agreeing to a settlement offer all states require every registered vehicle or licensed driver to have some vehicle liability insurance even if it was not required by law drivers should purchase liability coverage to protect them in the event of a car accident twelve states have no fault auto insurance in most cases in these states you will only be making claims to your insurance companies if you are at fault in a car accident your car insurance pays for the damages that you cause to the other driver through liability insurance and pays for any damage to your car or yourself through collision insurance liability insurance covers bodily injury expenses including medical bills rehabilitation expenses and lost wages it also covers property damage expenses including the repair or replacement of anything belonging to the other driver of the car while usually only the car itself is damaged in an accident property damage can include items that were damaged in the car most people have a comprehensive plan that incorporates both of these types of insurance you cannot recover money from an insurance company unless liability exists to show liability you must show that the other driver was negligent which means the other driver was careless you don t want to be the negligent driver some examples of driver negligence are not seeing another vehicle that should have been seenfollowing too closelydriving too fast for the circumstances weather visibility etc making an unsafe turndisobeying traffic signals or signstalking on the phone texting while drivingrear ending another carsome states have negligence laws that may reduce your claim if both you and the other driver contributed to the cause of the accident your claim may be completely defeated and the insurance company will not have to pay anything or reduced in amount in states that operate under contributory negligence laws you cannot win a claim if you were the least bit negligent even as little as 1 the states that use contributory negligence are alabama maryland north carolina virginia and the district of columbia most states operate under comparative negligence laws under this law your claim will be reduced in proportion to your fault for example if you were 30 at fault and the other driver was 70 at fault the amount of your settlement will be

query	9	choose between arbitration and mediation when you don t want to go to court to resolve a dispute then you should consider alternate dispute resolution adr two of the more popular forms of adr are mediation and arbitration they are very different and each has different strengths and weaknesses to help you choose between the two you should closely consider your own needs if you have questions then you should contact an attorney analyzing arbitration and mediation choosing between mediation and arbitration starting the process identify the strengths of mediation consider the weaknesses of mediation understand the strengths of arbitration analyze the weaknesses of arbitration compare costs identify your priorities analyze how committed you are to compromise check how much money you have consider your relationship with the other side analyze the strength of your case meet with an attorney find a mediator research the mediator s background decide what kinds of arbitrators you want find an arbitrator mediation is a process where you and the other party to the dispute will meet with a neutral third party this third party is called the mediator the mediator is not a judge instead they try to get each side to listen to each other many people find the following to be mediation s strengths it s not adversarial instead you and the other side work to reach a resolution you both can live with it allows for creative resolutions for example you might want an apology or you might want to have the other side offer an explanation for what happened it is possible to obtain these kinds of resolutions in mediation it s confidential nothing you say in mediation is revealed either later in court or to the press depending on your point of view mediation might not be the ideal method for resolving your dispute for example the following are features of most mediations it s voluntary you might find this to be a strength or a weakness if you want a definite resolution to a dispute then mediation might not provide it in mediation either side can stand up and end the mediation you have to compromise you might be focused on winning and having someone say a judge tell the other side that they were wrong this won t happen in mediation if winning is important then you might try arbitration you usually have to be in the same room as the other person if you are afraid of the other party or if you are too emotional then mediation is probably not effective mediation doesn t typically have a discovery process where you can request information from the other side accordingly you shouldn t choose mediation if you are unsure of exactly what happened arbitration is more like a trial you and the other side present evidence and witnesses and the arbitrator decides who wins the case the arbitrator can award an amount of money to the winning party arbitration has a reputation for the following it s confidential like mediation what happens in arbitration is not revealed publicly arbitration is a formal process if you re afraid of the other side then you might find safety in the formality you can win you don t need to compromise in arbitration instead you can make a demand for money compensation and if you prove your case then the arbitrator will award you a sum of money it is usually binding the arbitrator s decision has the same effect as a judge s decision there is usually a limited discovery process although not as extensive as in a lawsuit arbitration allows for discovery you can request documents from the other side and potentially have witnesses answer questions under oath before the arbitration begins discovery is a good way to uncover the full extent of the other side s wrongdoing arbitration isn t right for everyone it has some common features that you should be aware of before choosing between it and mediation for example consider the following you might need a lawyer to put on your most effective case you can also use a lawyer in mediation however because mediation is not adversarial there is less need for one it might be a lengthy process arbitration has a reputation for being a faster alternative to a trial however arbitration has steadily become a slower process over the years it will probably be much slower than mediation you could lose if you are the defendant in a high stakes dispute then going to arbitration and losing is the same as losing in court if you mediate the dispute then you can reduce the amount of money you have to pay to the other side costs are probably a concern for most people both mediation and arbitration are generally cheaper than a lawsuit in court however they might have different costs depending on your situation you should try to estimate the costs before choosing between the two if the court or bar association offers mediation or arbitration services then you should call them up and check how much each generally costs you can hire mediators by the hour generally they charge 70 400 an hour you can call up a mediator and explain your dispute ask the mediator to estimate how long they think it will take to resolve the issue you can get an estimate for the costs of arbitration by talking to someone who has arbitrated a similar dispute before you can properly choose between mediation and arbitration you need to understand what is important to you give some time to thinking about the following and rank them in importance how important is it for you not to have to testify or be cross examined many people find any kind of dispute stressful and arbitration could be more stressful than mediation do you just want money or do you want an apology also because of its flexibility mediation might be a better option if you want something other than money are you unsure about what you want in this situation voluntary mediation is a better choice than binding arbitration because you can stop the mediation process at any time do you want the dispute resolved with as little hassle as possible if so mediation is a good bet the mediator will help guide discussion keep everyone on track and help draft a settlement agreement if the mediation is successful are you risk averse and afraid of losing if so then mediation is the better choice you might think mediation is the better choice because it is often cheaper and less adversarial however mediation will not be successful unless you are committed to making the process work in fact mediation will be a disaster if you aren t willing to compromise be honest with yourself not everyone wants to compromise and resolve the dispute in a friendly manner if someone has wronged you terribly then you probably won t be committed to mediation nevertheless you can always have a lawyer try to negotiate a settlement if your case is strong then the settlement amount might be close to what you are asking for in a lawsuit you shouldn t pick a dispute resolution technique if you can t afford it analyze whether you have the money to go through with either mediation or arbitration if you want to continue working with the other side then mediation will be the better option for you because mediation isn t confrontational you can leave the process with your relationship intact however arbitration might be an acceptable option if you never plan on seeing or doing business with the other side again you might have an airtight case in this situation arbitration might make more sense since you can win and won t have to compromise you should analyze your evidence as honestly as possible an arbitrator like a judge focuses on the law you should research the law that will be used in your case for example if you are suing for medical malpractice then you can read court opinions from your state on google scholar read relevant opinions to find out what proof you will need to win your case you can also ask an attorney to neutrally evaluate your evidence and explain whether you are likely to win under the law you may still be confused about whether to pick mediation or arbitration if so then you should get a referral to an attorney and schedule a consultation you can get a referral from your local or state bar association at your consultation you should talk generally with the lawyer about your dispute and about what is important to you the lawyer can then help you decide whether arbitration or mediation is better for you you can find mediators in a variety of places for example your local courthouse might keep a list of court approved mediators you can also find mediators in the following places your local bar association many attorneys are also mediators you can get a referral to someone by contacting the bar association a community mediation center stop into your town office and ask if anything is available online you can search for mediators in your city or state by doing a general internet search private mediation centers some of the larger include the american arbitration association jams endispute and judicate you and the other party should agree to the mediator ask for the mediator s background information such as experience or a resume share this information with the other side and make sure you both agree before hiring the person remember to get a quote for the mediator s hourly fee arbitrators come in many shapes and sizes for example you can get an arbitrator who is a specialist in the subject matter of the dispute for example if you have a construction dispute then you can find an arbitrator who has experience as an architect or engineer you can also have a panel of three arbitrators though this costs more for example you could pick one arbitrator and your opponent could pick one then the two arbitrators will choose the third arbitrator there are many independent arbitrators who may have been former judges or current lawyers there are also many national and international agencies that offer arbitration services however you might have already agreed to work with a particular arbitrator for example many commercial contracts contain an arbitration clause this clause might state that you agree to use an arbitrator from a certain arbitration association such as jams or the american arbitration association read your contract to see if you have agreed to work with a certain association if the contract doesn t mention a particular arbitration association then you can pick your own

sensibilities and demeanors high versus low impact a more lengthy explanation of the pros and cons are below your current fitness level if you are in great shape maybe a very energetic program is for

working out your entire body in a thoughtful manner of the five recommended elements of physical activity aerobic exercise strength training core exercise balance training and flexibility aerobics itself is simply one piece of the overall picture however with a little bit of pre planning you can incorporate steps and tools into your workout plan that help you achieve the recommended balance aerobic exercise obviously you want to keep your heart rate elevated throughout this is why aerobics instructors ask you to march in place in between steps rather than stopping and taking a break if you can speak easily you re not working out hard enough strength training holding hand weights while performing your aerobics routine will help build muscles in the arm while adding ankle weights will build leg muscle core strength incorporate moves that target the muscles in your abdomen windmills for example the addition of hand weights while performing windmills will result in an even better core workout balance training many moves in aerobics require you to shift your weight from one foot to the other focus on the slow deliberate transfer of weight and the balance of your body when doing these steps hamstring curls and ski jumps for example are a good opportunity to focus on balance flexibility when performing steps that require stretching commit all the way to the stretch windmills are a great example of an exercise where you may not be able to reach your feet at first due to poor flexibility with some attention and practice your flexibility will increase over time aerobics will lead you through a wide range of motion so don t wear stiff clothes that will keep you from moving your arms and legs comfortably you ll also sweat a lot so wear clothes that won t make you overheat athletic shorts and a t shirt will work just fine make sure you re wearing shoes designed for exercise not flats or work shoes you ll be swinging your arms kicking your legs and moving around while doing your aerobics routine you don t want to knock things over so pull tables and chairs into a corner clearing a large space where you can move freely without having to worry about breaking something or hurting yourself by running into a table studies have shown a correlation between a good workout playlist and increased workout efficiency because the main point of aerobics is to raise your heart rate choose only music that has a fast rhythm so you ll have to work hard to keep up with the beat only choose songs that you like though the more you enjoy the music the more you ll get into the steps you re doing and the better your workout will be furthermore if you enjoy the workout because of the music you ll be less likely to get bored and stop working out after a couple of sessions dynamic stretches are movements that go through a full range of motion as opposed to static stretches that are held for twenty or thirty seconds there are many different types of dynamic stretches that you can do to warm up arm circles can help increase the range of motion in your shoulders hold your arms out straight to form a t make small circles with them for ten seconds before reversing the direction of the circle raise your arms in front of you before bringing them straight above your head try to bring them down as far back behind you as they will go move them back to starting position and repeat lie down to do hip and knee bends bend your knee as you bring it up towards your chest slowly straighten it back out again repeat with the other leg if you don t replenish your body with water throughout your workout you can overexert and hurt yourself so keep water nearby and drink whenever you get thirsty or need to cool down a little low impact aerobics avoid movements that put a lot of pressure on joints including movements like jumping running in place and the like low impact aerobics is designed to minimize the risk of leg injuries and is recommended for seniors pregnant women and overweight people if you fall into one of those categories or have joint problems you should not attempt high impact aerobics at all unless you doctor approves it for you if you re out of shape and want to ease your way into a workout regimen low impact aerobics is a great way to get your body used to a range of motions before you start pushing yourself low impact

patterns may also cause injury cycle through a variety of different motions it doesn t matter what order you go in but stay in each motion for at least one or two minutes before moving on to the next motion you should repeat the same motions repeatedly throughout your workout if you are having difficulty with a more advanced move return to more basic movements such as stepping back and forth once your muscles stop burning go back to the more difficult motions don t begin your workout in earnest until you ve warmed up your body in warming up you gradually increase blood flow throughout your body and loosen up the muscle groups you ll be using reducing the risk of muscle stress use the rhythm of the music you re playing to guide your steps but the music should be fairly fast paced to make sure you re moving fast enough to get your heart rate up your arms can hang naturally at your sides or you can swing them in a sharp but controlled motion to work out your arm muscles as well make sure to lift your knees enough to cause your legs to burn over a period of time simply shuffling in place will not make you sweat do this for at least two minutes to warm your body up in preparation for a wider range of more demanding movements get into the music clap your hands if you feel like it the more fun you re having the more likely you ll be to continue exercising walk forward three steps swinging your arms energetically at your sides on the fourth count tap your foot on the ground and clap your hands repeat this motion moving backwards so you end up where you began remember to change which leg you being with repeat motion for as long as you d like until you get bored of it and want to move on to a new movement lift your hands to shoulder or chest level every time you draw a foot back and fully extend your arms downward with every foot extension keep your motions controlled and deliberate to make sure that you re engaging your muscles instead of letting gravity do all the work for you then bring your left foot to your right foot and touch the ground with it move your left foot back out to your original position then touch your right foot to the ground by your left foot you can combine this with any number of arm movements from controlled arm swings to shoulder rolls a shoulder roll is simply when you pull one shoulder forward slightly then roll it up and back alternate shoulders to the beat of the music working out your shoulder and back muscles lower your body into a squat and start taking small steps forward continue walking forward for thirty to sixty seconds this increases the burn in your thighs you can pump your arms in a controlled manner at your sides it s important to keep a straight back during this step to prevent back pain then repeat the process to the right side kick your leg out to the front on the last beat when you would normally simply tap one foot to the other to increase your activity rate begin the movement to the left with your arms down and slowly lift them out to your sides and up over your head in a deliberate wide motion with your hands meeting over your head on the fourth beat bring your arms down during your movement to the right so the return to their beginning position don t swing your entire leg just bend your heel back toward your bottom bring your foot back down then repeat the motion on the left side alternating sides to the rhythm of the music you can push your arms forward as though pushing the air away from your chest on the leg curl then pull your arms back into your chest when you return your foot to the ground you can also do bow and arrows with your arms extend one arm out directly to the side and tuck the other into your chest while keeping your elbow pointed out to the side alternate sides to match your feet movement the motion should look a little bit like using a bow and arrow to increase the muscle exertion you can double or triple up on the curls you do on each side before moving on to the other leg this way you muscle doesn t get to relax immediately and the workout is a little more difficult there are many styles of low impact aerobic exercise so you should be able to find a class that works for you keep an eye out for low impact step aerobicslow impact zumba classes though zumba a dance exercise that incorporates latin and world music usually involves a good amount of jumping and bouncing that can be stressful on joints look for a class that offers a low impact alternative power yoga power yoga is a more athletic form of yoga that was invented in the united states it s a rigorous exercise that will increase your heart rate without stressing your joints but make sure to look for a beginner s class a spinning class these classes involve riding a stationary bike but are often set to workout music chosen by the class s instructorwater aerobics these classes take place in a pool the water s natural buoyancy protects your joints but also provides greater resistance to your movements resulting in a safe and vigorous workout research suggests that when healthy bodies engage in activities that exert force on the joints it can actually help build and strengthen bone and of course more strenuous exercise raises the heart rate more again do not attempt high impact aerobics if you have joint or bone pain unless your doctor permits it if you think you re in good enough shape to jump right into high impact aerobics this is a great way to get your heart rate pumping harder and shape your muscles more than low impact aerobics just as with low impact aerobics you will create your own combinations and routines from a range of steps all performed to high paced music warm up just as you would for low impact aerobics by marching in place this is just to get your body ready for physical exertion perform dynamic movements with a full range of motion start by doing arm shoulder leg ankle and wrist circles gradually increase the range of motion by doing knee neck and back bends march in place for about two minutes before beginning your combinations this motion calls for you to jump moving your legs back and forth in a scissoring motion you can keep your hands on your hips or swing them in a controlled motion at your sides as you normally would during walking or running but with a more exaggerated range from a standing position jump so your left foot is forward and your right foot is back jump again switching the position of your feet you should switch foot position for each beat of the song you re listening to make sure to center your balance put your arms out to the side to stabilize yourself if you feel like you re going to fall begin with your feet about shoulder width apart in the stride position extend your arms out directly to your sides making sure they stay parallel to the ground keeping your arms straight through the elbow reach your right arm down to touch the instep of your left shoe do you best not to bend your knees your left arm should swing behind your body and your face should rotate to look out to the left return to your original position then repeat on the other side touching your left hand to your right shoe keep your abs contracted make sure that your back straight as flat as possible instead of letting it slump and get rounded let your arms swing naturally at your side as they would during a normal jogging motion if you want to make this motion more difficult bring your knees up higher alternate between normal jogging and high knee jogging to keep your heart rate up without wearing yourself out completely from your bending position jump up and to the right side making sure you jump with both feet at the same time then land with both feet at the same time balance your weight over your heels and sink down into your bent stance again the jumping movement should be completely lateral not forward and back as you re completing the jumping motion with your legs bring your hands up to the sides of your head as you extend into the jump then bring them down to your sides keeping elbows bent as you land and go back into your bent position jump from left to right repeating this motion to increase the level of difficulty place an object next to you to jump over by increasing the required height of the jump you ll get a better workout regardless of which step you re doing from hamstring curls to windmills repeat each motion three times before switching sides this increases the level of difficulty and makes your muscles burn more quickly since you don t get a chance to rest that side of your body immediately after performing a movement there are many styles of high impact aerobic exercise so you should be able to find one that meets your liking some examples of classes to keep an eye out for include step aerobicszumba a dance exercise that incorporates latin and world musiccrossfit training a demanding exercise program that cycles you through a

and parody understood that the more people feel included and the more people understand broader references the funnier the film will be movies and genres that tend to take themselves very seriously tend to be the best targets of satire generally the more a movie or genre tries to avoid humor the riper it is for making fun of genre movies are those with similar plots any type of movie you ve seen 10 versions of like slasher films romantic comedies sports films etc a great spoof pays attention to the original and uses it as the jumping off point for the screenplay and you need to do your research watch both the movies and any other related spoofs noting what they find humor in and where things are ripe for joking some things to pay attention to are recurring character types is the cast usually a variation on the same 3 characters if so you ll need to include parody versions of them too common cliches and story arcs are their plot moments lines or shots that every single movie has in common how can you subvert them to make them funny themes or issues of the genre what does the movie seem to address is it over the top action and adrenaline in cop movies spoofed in the other guys or self righteous documentaries spoofed in the series documentary now there are few movies without plot holes and most things you re spoofing will be full of them instead of shying away expose these plot holes to comical extremes pointing out places the original film got a little too ahead of itself again remember that broader plots like how horror movie characters always want to split up are easier to spoof than one plot point in one specific movie most spoofs basically steal the common plot structure from the movie they parody using this as the framework to make jokes from having the characters acknowledge the issue or problem or have one character in particular who jokes about the plot hole like the stoner in house in the woods forcing the plot on the characters for example the character accidentally becomes the classic hero or saves the day despite trying not to be involved or not trying at all resolve the plot holes in a ridiculous way blazing saddles does this with great skill or simply cut to the aftermath of the big moment without explaining how everyone made it through like anchorman s quick turnaround on will ferrell cleaning up and putting on a fresh suit in under two seconds one of the best examples of this spoiler alert is in the medieval spoof monty python and the holy grail where the film ends with king arthur and his knights getting arrested by modern day cops in the midst of an enormous battle it turns out the whole movie is just adults playing violent dress up surprise is at the root of all comedy and spoofs are the perfect place for a surprise your audience knows what plot point or reveal is expected based on the original movie or genre shake it up inverted characters are always a great spoof tactic from bumbling expert cops in the naked gun to the intelligent kickass sidekick in the green hornet remake this is spinal tap a parody of rock documentaries takes this joke almost literally in the infamous 11 speech where a guitarist brags that his amp s volume knobs go all the way up to 11 not just 10 like a normal amp spoofs gain humor by exposing how ridiculous the ideas and plots of movies really are and how far off they are from the real world the greatest parodies almost without fail still manage to respect and honor the movies they are spoofing the do this by remembering what made the movies so special and worth of parody after all no one spoofs a movie that no one watched in the first place this can mean expanding on the themes or the film like in sean of the dead or simply picking out the most popular elements and playing them up highly like in austin power sean of the dead begins the film with a zombie like walk to and from work then repeats the same shot after a zombie infestation occurs the main character doesn t notice anything different the second time a comical moment that reinforces the idea that we re all zombies sometimes an important theme that plays out up until the very ending austin powers follows a typical spy plot but its longevity comes from its recognition of what makes the spy movies so fun traveling the globe crazy fashion and gadgets and lots of beautiful women in comedy the straight man is the person who most represents the viewer they are the only ones who seem to realize how insane or crazy things are around them which makes the craziness and spoofing around them all the funnier think of simon pegg s tightly wound cop in the police parody hot fuzz or michael bluth in arrested development while a bit of an advanced skill peppering in the voice of reason will make all of the ridiculous stuff sound normal by comparison the straight man can be a parody as well and it is usually best when they are the main character of airplane is a war pilot coming back to face calm normal life as a civilian pilot but if you ve seen any disaster movie ever you know it won t be so easy a funny spoof needs to be a funny movie all on its own and constant references to other films will get old fast let yourself cut loose and just be funny even if the joke doesn t have a cousin in the real movies open original jokes will make the film feel less like a rip off or one of those widely panned spoofs where every joke is simply a reference to things that happen in other movies use your references to add a layer of humor not to supply all the jokes check austin powers for example dr evil is a great parody of common spy villains but things like his relationship with his less evil son transcend parody to become great family comedy in any movie this makes the son s turn towards evil even funnier later on as the parody aspects come full circle one of the funniest scenes in will ferrel s telenovela parody casa de mi padre is a take on the cowboy singalong but as the musical continues it veers into wildly different and hilarious new territory based on the image of them all singing for example any spoof of the blair witch project should be using hand held camera work to replicate the shaky look of the original shooting a game of thrones parody you better have lots of low camera angles on the power players and dramatic sweeping shots of your location which can humorously reveal things as you turn the camera not all movies have an easily discernible visual style but they all have common pieces while romantic comedies are shot in a straightforward manner you definitely need a happy music montage of the couple falling in love the other idea is to go as far from the actual movie as possible shooting instead in a comically different location like the aforementioned ending of the holy grail the best spoofs play off of the original movies from script to stage and your actors are a key factor show them the characters they are spoofing in their natural habitat so they everyone is on the same page find the major motivation or parody of the character the pompous hero the bumbling sidekick use these characters as baselines especially for big moments instead of starting from scratch on a rakish sleazy pirate ship captain you can say act like han solo but way creepier and more flirty looking at the camera laughing or acknowledging that this isn t how things normally are is called breaking the 4th wall you re basically reminding everyone that they re watching a movie which can work in small doses see the film noir spoof kiss kiss bang bang for a wonderful example but most jokes should be told straight that means your actors accept the lines and events as if they were real life to your characters the world they live in is the only world they know no matter how wacky check leslie nielsen star of famous spoofs from airplane to the naked gun for a masterclass in straight faced comedy it may seem counter intuitive to ape the movie you re making fun of but this level of detail will make the jokes far funnier great spoofs could at quick glance be the very movies they are making fun of this sucks the audience in the surprise of your twists and jokes are much funnier because they are juxtaposed against a more serious backdrop the tv show community s now famous action movie spoof modern warfare had more visual jokes than most full length spoofs from the general such as a trickle of green paint sliding ominously down the wall spoofing blood to a character s slow mo dives flips and machine gun fire calling up images of the matrix and scarface an attention to visual humor will wring out a lot of laughs adjust and play with your props making a fantasy spoof try changing the emblems on the shields or coat of arms to something ridiculous or funny don t be afraid to steal famous shots and do something funny with them airplane begins with the plane cutting through the clouds set to the music from jaws re creating the shot in a new light this seems counter intuitive but remember the old rule of tragedy time comedy if you put your characters in somewhat legitimate danger introduce real consequences and live in the world you re spoofing then it will be that much funnier when everything blows up in the character s faces a good spoof still respects and pays attention to the classics and is a better movie for it while any movie in this article could fit this step sean of the dead is a particularly good example it actually owns up the horror elements in a few key scenes playing like a traditional zombie movie which leads to an enormously funny and satisfying payoff in the end comedy in general is a quick moving art form as surprise and speed are key to getting laughs and stringing them together spoofs are often even faster because they rarely have original plots that the audience needs to think of try to keep the jokes rolling quickly if one fails there is another one right behind it and let the plot stay simple most spoofs are on the shorter end usually 90 100 minutes as there is always a danger of the movie overstaying its welcome if it doesn t have anything original to say

mixture on using a wide bristle paintbrush lay the fabric flat to dry completely purchase some iron on vinyl from a fabric store get out your fabric but don t cut your fabric yet if you are using a pattern make sure that the fabric is clean and dry lay the fabric on a flat surface cut the vinyl so that it fits your fabric peel off the paper backing set the vinyl sticky side down onto the right side of the fabric cover the vinyl with the paper backing run an iron over the paper take the paper off purchase a bar of natural beeswax heat the wax and cloths a little rub the beeswax across the fabric in both directions spread the wax out with your fingers to make it move even heat the item again with a hair dryer for about five minutes smooth the item again with your fingers if necessary set the item to cure in a warm dry place try to work outside or in a well ventilated area stretch the fabric over an open back frame and secure it with clips purchase some linseed oil start applying the linseed oil onto the fabric in a thick layer wait 30 minutes before wiping any oil residue off with a clean rag let the fabric dry for 24 hours then repeat the process once the fabric has dried get out your linseed oil again and apply more of it to the fabric consider painting your fabric using oil paint between layers of linseed oil you will be working with spray on sealers which are sensitive to humidity also if you are working outside and it is windy you might get some dust embedded in your fabric if the fabric cannot be washed and it is only dusty or lightly soiled fabrics then clean it a vacuum or a brush if the fabric is heavily soiled then use a specially formulated fabric cleaner you will be working sprays and sealers that repel water if your fabric is in anyway damp or wet the sprays and sealers will not stick try to work outside if you can if you cannot work outside then open up a window you can also wear safety goggles and gloves if you have sensitive skin or bad allergies the sprays and sealers you will be working with can be quite pungent you can find them at an outdoor or camping supply store if the fabric you will be waterproofing will be outside and in the sun a lot then consider getting a spray that has uv protection as well this will keep your fabric from fading waterproofing sprays and sealers will work great on nylons canvas and leather be sure to slightly overlap each stroke let the spray dry completely before using the fabric most waterproofing sprays will dry in about 4 hours but you might want to read the directions on the can as each brand will be a little different seam sealer usually comes in a small bottle with an applicator on top simply roll the sealer over the seams while squeezing gently on the bottle this will make the seams extra durable and ensure that no water gets inside if the fabric you are working with is dirty then wash it for dusty or lightly soiled fabrics that cannot be washed use a vacuum or a brush for heavily soiled fabrics that cannot be washed use a specially formulated fabric cleaner you want the container to be large enough so that you can submerge all of your fabric in the detergent mixture if parts of the fabric keep floating to the top you can weigh them down with a glass jar or bottle do not fold it over a hanger or the two sides will stick to each other instead clip the top of the fabric piece to a hanger if the fabric is too big for a hanger then stretch a long piece of string between two poles or trees and clip the fabric to that you want the fabric to hang freely in a single layer stir the solution to help the alum powder dissolve you can buy alum powder at a grocery store if it floats to the top then weigh it down with a glass jar or bottle once again make sure that the fabric is hanging freely clip it to a hanger or to a piece of string you will be saturating the fabric with turpentine diluted oil oil in general tends to darken fabrics by a shade or two this is something you might want to keep in mind wash the fabric if it is dirty if the fabric cannot be washed and it s only a little dirty or dusty then clean it with a vacuum or a brush if the fabric cannot be washed and it is heavily soiled then clean it using a specially formulated fabric cleaner you will be working with waxes oils and other solutions that repel water if your fabric is in anyway damp or wet the solutions you will be using will not stick try to work outside if you can if you cannot work outside then keep a window open turpentine can get quite pungent pour everything into a durable plastic container and stir it with a wooden paint stirrer you will be painting the mixture onto your fabric later using a large paintbrush if you are working on a small piece of fabric then you can pour everything into a plastic spray bottle and spray it on close the bottle and shake it to mix everything together turpentine and oil can both stain porous surfaces such as wood and concrete if you are worried about this you might want to protect your work surface with plastic tablecloth first don t use newspaper the ink can transfer to your fabric dip a large paintbrush into the mixture and wipe the excess mixture off on the rim of the bucket brush the mixture onto the fabric using a long straight even stroke keep brushing the mixture onto the fabric until everything is covered always go in the same direction also try to overlap the strokes by a little this will prevent any gaps a wide flat bristle brush will work the best for this avoid soft bristles such as camel hair if you are using a spray bottle then simply spray the mixture onto the fabric try to overlap the patches by a little to avoid any gaps this can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days once again turpentine and soybean oil can both cause stains so it might be a good idea to cover the flat surface with a plastic tablecloth first this vinyl doesn t change the appearance of the fabric and is great for waterproofing baby bibs and lunch bags once you have waterproofed the fabric you can use it as a tablecloth or even cut it up and sew it into a lunch bag if the fabric you are working with is dirty then wash it and let it dry completely if the fabric cannot be washed then use a vacuum or a brush you can also use a specially formulated fabric cleaner if the fabric is heavily soiled this will make the fabric easier to work with any ripples or folds will end up as wrinkles in the finished piece if necessary iron the fabric out to get it as smooth as possible if the vinyl is too narrow for your fabric then you will need to cut the vinyl to the length of your fabric you will need to cut several pieces like this and overlap them later on you will notice that the paper has two sides a shiny side and a dull side you will also notice that the vinyl has two sides as well a sticky side and a smooth side if the vinyl is not wide enough lay two sheets of vinyl next to each other overlap the edges by inch 0 64 centimeter make sure that the shiny side of the paper is facing down and that the paper is covering the vinyl entirely you will be ironing the vinyl and the paper will help protect it from getting melted turn on your iron and set it to medium heat do not use a high heat setting or you will melt the vinyl carefully run the iron over the paper do not leave it in one spot for too long and do not use any steam the heat of the iron will have melted the glue on the vinyl and fused it to the fabric if the fabric you are working with is dirty then wash it and let it dry completely this method will work best on canvas shoes and bags you might want to use pure beeswax for this without any additives anything else may contain harmful chemicals you can do this by blowing them with a hairdryer or leaving them out in the hot sun for a few minutes this will make the wax easier to apply you do not want the clothes to be hot and you do not want the wax to be melted rub it side to side and up and down this will help the wax get into the weave of the fabric if you are covering a piece of clothing or a bag use the corners of the wax to get into small seams and spaces gently rub the wax into small tight areas such as seams corners and pockets if the item you are covering has buttons make sure to wipe the wax off this will allow the wax to melt into the fabric you will see the fabric becoming a little darker if there are any pools or puddles of wax run your fingers across the fabric in circular motions to smooth it out this will give your piece a nice finish leave it there for 24 hours after this time the waxed article will be ready to use you may notice that the fabric is a little stiffer and darker than before this is normal the fabric will soften with time but it won t get lighter again if the fabric is dirty you will need to wash it and let it dry completely linseed oil can get pungent so the extra ventilation might help keep you from feeling lightheaded if you are working outside make sure that the area is free of dust and that there is no wind or you might end up with dust particles embedded in your finished piece if you cannot work outside then make sure that you have a window open you can use a cheap picture frame with the glass and cardboard backing taken out make sure that the fabric covers the entire frame if the fabric is too big for the frame then you will need to work on it in parts you can also use jojoba oil it is a little lighter than linseed oil which might make it easier to work with you want the fabric to be completely saturated with the oil don t worry if it feels like you are using too much you will be wiping the excess off you can apply the oil with a wide boar bristle paintbrush or with a rag avoid using a brush made from camel hair the soft bristles will be too weak to spread the oil if the oil came in a small bottle then consider pouring it into a large cup this will give the oil enough time to soak into the fabric and saturate it after this time you may notice some residue on the surface of the fabric use a clean cloth to wipe it off wait 30 minutes then wipe the excess oil off using a clean rag you can add one or two more layers use an oil painting paintbrush to apply the oil paint these brushes are usually made out of stiff bristles such as boar bristles or taklon which is synthetic apply the linseed oil with a brush instead of a rag so that you do not blur your design

when you take your japanese to the next level by signing up for some classes japanese language uses four different writing systems that have different characters to speak the language you don t necessarily need to learn how to write in japanese but it s important to understand the way the four systems work together hiragana is a japanese syllabary a system of characters used to represent distinct japanese sounds katakana is similar to hiragana in that it is made up of japanese sounds but it is mostly composed of words that originated in different languages it could be considered the syllabary for foreign words together hiragana and katakana cover every sound in the japanese language 46 in total kanji are chinese characters adapted for japanese that are the foundation of japanese writing the sounds used to pronounce kanji are the same as those used in hiragana and katakana in japanese language the latin alphabet is sometimes used for acronyms company names and names meant to be read by non japanese speakers romaji the written roman version of japanese words is also worth mentioning even though it is not used in japan it is recommended that new students of japanese skip romaji and learn japanese characters instead once you start learning romaji it s difficult to associate japanese sounds with japanese characters the sounds corresponding to the hiraganaand katakanaalphabets are composed of either one of five vowel sounds or a combination of a consonant and a vowel sound with the exception of a few consonant only sounds since each character in hiragana and katakana has only one distinct sound it is relatively easy to learn how to pronounce all 46 pay special attention to intonation though since variations on these basic sounds can drastically change the meaning whereas english pronunciation is based on accents japanese pronunciation is based on pitch a word may be pronounced the same way and mean something different depending on whether it is spoken in a high or low pitch to sound like a native speaker getting intonation right is key japanese characters may be written with extra strokes to signify that they should be pronounced with an additional sound the additional sounds fall into these categories voiced consonants which are pronounced with a voice a vibration in the throat there are 4 voiced consonants and one semi voiced consonant y vowel sounds which can directly follow consonant sounds to change the pronunciation hard consonant sounds which add a hard stop between sounds long vowel sounds the meaning of a sound can alter depending on how long the vowel sound is held japanese grammar is quite different from other languages but it follows a logical format that is easy to learn the following is true about japanese grammar nouns don t have plural forms and they don t change according to gender verbs don t change according to gender number or whether the subject is an object or person the predicate is always at the end of the sentence personal pronouns vary based on different levels of politeness and formality particles directly follow the word they relate to for example instead of saying i am japanese it would be i japanese am japanese is a popular language that is taught at nearly every university and community college check into taking a course at a local school so that you can learn under the instruction of someone who is fluent in japanese do your japanese homework it may seem like it will take forever to learn the 2 000 kanji characters or get a grasp on japanese vocabulary but these are important steps to take if you want to learn how to speak japanese with fluency participate in workshops and class discussions the written homework is important but learning how to converse in japanese requires that you get out of your comfort zone and let your voice be heard during class raise your hand go to the workshops and get in as much speaking practice as you can online courses are a good alternative if you want to save a little money many are designed to encourage you to speak out loud by hosting virtual classroom discussions and workshops do some research to find a course that fits your needs and take it as seriously as you would any university course language software produced by companies like rosetta stone is designed to help you learn at your own pace by using cds and

japanese speakers so that you can practice speaking in different contexts and situations for example take a trip to the botanical garden and focus on learning japanese words for different plants and trees speak with japanese speakers a little bit each day even when you aren t meeting for a group discussion give someone a call and converse only in japanese or drop by your professor s office hours for a little extra practice this is an excellent way to learn more about japanese language when you aren t able to spend time with japanese speakers replace your regular shows with anime and watch at least one japanese movie a week to immerse yourself in the language at home rashomon seven samurai and spirited away are popular japanese movies you can start by watching the films with subtitles but you ll get a better immersion experience if you turn them off and focus instead on the japanese sounds and pronunciation taking a trip to japan and spending as much time there as possible is the best

query	14	deal with a selfish mother the idea of a selfish mother may sound like something of an oxymoron but unfortunately it can be a very real damaging and challenging situation to cope with the challenge of dealing with a selfish mother arises in part because selfish people tend to act how they want to despite what others want making change and negotiation particularly difficult many of us have the implicit or explicit assumption that mothers are caring which can make her selfishness especially confusing and painful recognizing selfishness protecting yourself confronting your mother acknowledge that selfishness is not the same as not giving you what you want look for win lose outcomes watch for emotional manipulation look for signs of neglect consider your own actions get social support define your own self worth support yourself distance yourself talk to your mother about what concerns you understand where she is coming from focus on her behaviors not her character use i statements keep the hyperbole out of it emphasize your own needs set boundaries speak assertively suggest family counseling threaten distance cut your losses and move on when we say a person is selfish what we often mean is that she isn t giving me what i want for example if you ask your mother for a playstation 4 and she says no but spends money on new shoes for herself you may think she s just being selfish however this isn t necessarily true perhaps she actually needs new shoes to go to work whereas your playstation 3 doesn t really need an expensive upgrade right now most people don t like not getting what we want that s natural but take the time to consider whether this is actually the result of selfish behavior from your mother or if it is due to something else you may also interpret behavior as selfish if it doesn t meet your needs as you define them for example if you want your mother to do your homework with you every night and she can t several nights because she has to work you might feel that she s being selfish to not meet your needs you have the right to want your mom to help you with homework but you should also acknowledge that she has other responsibilities that sometimes mean she can t help you in contrast if you ask your mother to buy you a new pair of sneakers because you ve outgrown yours and she says no but then spends money to buy herself something frivolous this may be an example of selfish behavior because she is not meeting your real needs selfishness often results in win lose situations where one person always comes out ahead and the other behind sometimes this outcome is unavoidable if you ask your mother to buy you alcohol when you re underage and she says no which she should do you re going to be in a win lose situation because she has decided the outcome she wants and you haven t gotten the outcome you want however in most cases compromise can help the two of you come to an agreement that works okay for both of you if your mother is never or rarely willing to compromise she may be behaving selfishly for example if your mother never allows you to use the car to go see friends because she wants you to spend time with her this could be an example of selfishness however if she only allows you to use the car on weekends because she wants to you to be in bed early on school nights this is a compromise you get to socialize with your friends sometimes and she gets to make sure that you re staying healthy and productive when you need to be another example of selfish mothering might be if she returns home from work and demands that you stop whatever you re doing and talk with her regardless of whether you have other responsibilities or commitments her desire to talk with you about your day is healthy but demanding attention on her own terms all the time is not she may say that you are ungrateful if you do not respond to her demands in the way she wants however a desire to talk with you itself isn t necessarily selfish nor is expressing that desire in an unhelpful way if your mom asks you to stop your homework and talk with her and you tell her that you can t because you have to get it done she should acknowledge that and ask for an alternate time this is a healthy compromise and acknowledges your needs as well as her own this isn t selfish even if her initial communication felt irritating or self centered remember that in some cases one of you may lose or not get what you want but in general healthy relationships even between parents and children are marked by mutuality and compromise an example of a win lose outcome for someone who no longer lives with her mother would be a mother who always asks to borrow money from her child but never pays her back and uses the money to gamble emotional manipulation is another hallmark of selfish behavior a classic example of this is the parental guilt trip the guilt trip may be unintentionally selfish your mother may feel like she s just expressing her love for you but it is coercive and unhealthy and can lead to resentment of her for example if you are looking at colleges and considering a few that are far away from where you live your mother might attempt to emotionally manipulate you into staying closer to home by saying things like fine go to college in wisconsin i guess you don t care that i ll be lonely as another example she might become easily offended if you tell her no for example if she asks you to do something and you say you can t she may remind you but i do so much for you nobody does as much for you as your mother she may try to make you feel like you take her for granted or she may compare you unfavorably to someone who loves his mother guilt trips and other types of emotional manipulation are selfish because they don t consider both people s needs as valid an emotionally manipulative or selfish mother will put her needs before yours all or most of the time if your mother guilt trips you it s very likely that she doesn t realize that this type of interaction can cause real harm studies suggest that people who use guilt tripping are often so focused on getting what they want through this technique that they don t realize it not only harms the other person it can come back to haunt them later by encouraging you to disconnect believe it or not sometimes parents can be selfish by giving you too much freedom to do what you want your mom s rules may seem overly strict or pointless to you but she has likely instituted them to give you a framework to keep you safe healthy and happy if your mother lets you do whatever you want whenever you want without talking to you about boundaries or consequences she could be being a selfish parent by not giving you the structure you need to develop for example if your mother lets you smoke and drink underage because she doesn t want to have to discipline you or help you end these bad habits this is actually selfish behavior emotional neglect is another sign of selfish parenting if you often feel like you walk on eggshells around her because she is easily impatient angry or controlling or you feel desperate to please her in the hopes of getting some validation or approval your mother may be a narcissistic parent this means that your relationship in her mind is all about her narcissists behave selfishly because they have difficulty empathizing or putting themselves in someone else s shoes and understanding their feelings another sign of emotional neglect is that you don t feel acknowledged by her perhaps she asks about your feelings but then doesn t really listen and blows through them to talk about herself perhaps she dismisses you when you try to talk to her about your feelings or concerns these are signs of a selfish narcissistic mother you may think your mother is being selfish but be sure this judgment is not being driven by the fact that you just aren t getting your own way think about whether what you are after or expecting from your mother is justified and reasonable this is not to undermine or take lightly your opinion on thinking your mother is selfish however when we get upset we can view others in a way that we later decide is inaccurate or irrational a relationship between parent and child is very significant so it should not be taken lightly extra caution is needed to evaluate the situation and decide how to move forward for example you may feel that your mother is selfish because she keeps pressuring you to choose a particular major in college that she enjoys but isn t something you re interested in it s possible that this is selfish motivated by her desire to feel accomplished through you at any cost it s also possible that she believes she is doing the best for you by encouraging you to do something she thinks you will succeed at think about your role in the situation have you expressed that you respect her opinion but will make your own choice or have you just been quiet and nodded your way through the 87th suggestion she may not understand that she s harassing you if you haven t communicated your own ideas if your mother is self absorbed and does not give you the attention or emotional support that you feel you need turn to others for that social support instead although no one can replace your mother you do not need a replacement to feel better about yourself reach out to friends and other family members to counteract the stress that can result from having a selfish mother having social support can protect against stress and can make you feel better in general and about yourself in particular reach out online or through friends who have also have selfish mothers it can help knowing that you are not alone in your struggle and it may be fruitful too you can put your heads together to figure out solutions to your shared problems if your mother does not care when you achieve something care that much more yourself about your achievements if your mother makes you feel bad about yourself because she needs you to be perfect in order to feel good about herself remind yourself that this is her problem not yours do not let other people even your mother define how you feel about your own sense of worth how you feel about yourself ultimately matters most as you are the one ultimately in charge of your life and your future no one will care more about yourself than you and so your opinion of you should matter most focus on achieving goals larger than yourself and not worrying about your situation with your mother as much as possible there are a couple of types of self esteem global self esteem is your attitude toward your whole self who you are as a complete person specific self esteem is your attitude about elements of yourself such performance in school or at work or your appearance both of these are important to feeling good about yourself adaptive self esteem is about being true to yourself with this type you feel authentic and that makes you feel good about yourself maladaptive self esteem is external it comes from meeting standards that aren t your own or by comparing yourself to others if you have a selfish mother you may have low self esteem because you have been taught to compare yourself to others or to external standards that aren t meaningful to you try to reorient your focus on achieving goals and building traits that are meaningful to you and haven t been dictated to anyone else this will help you care less about what others including your mother think about you for example if your mother has always told you that you need to lose weight and look more attractive you may have low self esteem about yourself try to find what is meaningful to you instead if you decide you want to lose weight to feel more fit and healthy go for it if you decide that you like just where you are be proud of that the goal is to accept yourself and set your own standards for yourself not allow anyone else to do it for you as another example if you told your mother that you got a job promotion and work and she fires back with an envious response saying that what you do for a living is nothing to be proud of think about her motives for saying something so nasty also think about what doing well at your job means for you and you alone your mother does not have nearly as close to an idea compared to you about what goes on at your job and the impact you have keep in mind that you are the expert on your life not her you will be less influenced by and thus better able to deal with your mother s selfishness if you support yourself more instead of relying on her for things you may even find that your relationship becomes more adult like as you develop a better sense of autonomy and maturity her selfishness may come to bother you less and this may help you deal with your relationship with her you can support yourself in multiple ways start by working toward making your own decisions more often you may find that you can make decisions fine on your own but just never gave yourself the chance another way to support yourself is to work toward meeting your own needs in particular learning how to comfort yourself will make you less reliant on your mother think hard about what comforts you and makes you happy for example you may find that you really calm down by listening to a specific song if you feel yourself getting upset acknowledge those feelings and address them by engaging in what calms you down treat yourself when you need it if you have a selfish mother who does not show you enough love show some love to yourself take yourself to the movies or a nice dinner pamper yourself with a manicure or go shopping just make sure you don t allow material stuff to take the place of affection then it s an unhelpful crutch rather than the occasional treat if your mother won t listen to you or change the things that are causing you pain and upset do what you can to remove yourself from her sphere of influence as much as possible try to become less dependent on your mother if she is self absorbed she is not someone you want to be depending on after all although it may be difficult at first in the long run you will likely feel better for it if you no longer live with your mother try limiting your contact with her to special occasions or family gatherings do not give into guilty feelings for distancing yourself from your mother if you truly believe she is selfish self absorbed or narcissistic and cannot or is not willing to change although guilt motivates us to repair relationships keep in mind that some relationships even sometimes with your mother are not worth repairing that said it is key that you have honestly assessed and accurately assessed your situation and have little reservation about the idea that your mother s selfishness is corrosive to your well being if she is willing to listen make sure not to be too aggressive confrontational or blaming otherwise she will be less likely to consider changing always talk in a calm collected manner even if she begins to yell keep your cool keep in mind that it is very difficult to change others behaviors and ways of thinking particularly if they are self absorbed or narcissistic think hard about what is motivating your mother to act selfishly perhaps your mother is going through hardships of her own and is not meaning to be selfish if your mother is elderly and is in poor health she may genuinely need more attention and help her selfishness may be a necessity of her new station in life if she was neglected as a child she may be insecure in her relationships with others and this may be contributing to her selfish self absorbed personality if you understand where she is coming from you may change your mind on how selfish she is actually being or if not you will at least have some sense on how to confront her when the time comes for example if you think she is selfish because she was neglected as a child you may remind her that you also feel neglected and that you two should work together to break the family cycle by improving your relationship not letting her parents and her past determine your shared future instead of saying things like you are selfish phrase your complaints more along the lines of i think that sometimes you act selfishly by doing this puts the emphasis on specific behaviors and refrains from directly making a character judgment judging her character will just put her on the defensive and make her upset if you isolate her specific actions she will more easily see how she has been acting inappropriately calling her selfish doesn t give her anything to work with saying things like you re selfish or you aren t being a good mother justly put people on the defensive if you use you statements with your mother she is likely to shut down and feel attacked even if otherwise she would have been open to listening use i statements to keep the focus on your feelings remember you can t know your mother s intentions but you can know your own feelings for example instead of saying you re inconsiderate and selfish use a specific i statement i feel neglected when you rush past my day to talk about your own all the time i would feel more valued as your child if you asked me questions about my life avoid should ought statements too such as you ought to listen to me more or you should be a better mother keep the focus on yourself and how you feel i don t feel heard when you brush my concerns off or i feel upset when you don t acknowledge my accomplishments if your mother is selfish it can feel like she is literally the most selfish person in the world and is ruining your life even if that feels like the truth you will have much better success in talking with her if you avoid hyperbolic and overemotional language for example avoid statements such as your selfishness is ruining my life instead go for something calm and balanced such as i have a hard time socializing with my friends when you do not let me use the car even on weekends the facts are the same but the latter statement is less blaming and judgmental and may get a better response your mother s selfishness may be driven by a lack of awareness about what you need there is a chance that she would be willing to change but that she just is oblivious to her own behavior tell your mother what you need out of your relationship with her focus on the things that you can t do without for example you may need her to listen to you sometimes or you may need her to be more encouraging or less critical and judgmental or you may need her to quit making all of the things that happen in your life ultimately about her when telling her a list of your needs also let her know about other things you would like from the relationship some day but that are not necessary to focus on right now this will let her know that you are willing to compromise and that you are not being unreasonable by expecting her to immediately adopt changes in every way that you would like for example you could say mom i could really use a pep talk from you every now and then i feel hurt when you don t acknowledge any of my accomplishments and don t want to hear about my day i d like you to put some time aside every week to listen to what s going on in my life if your mom is being selfish in an intrusive way such as by showing up to your house unannounced when she is not wanted there or by failing to give you privacy if you live with her let her know this is inappropriate tell her that her behavior is very frustrating and unacceptable start by setting small boundaries the trick is to start small like getting your foot in the door and then building up to bigger boundaries once she is used to the smaller boundaries here s an example if your mom shows up at your apartment most nights without being invited and then acts angry or hurt when you re busy setting a small boundary would be to say that you need her to call you before she comes over to visit setting a bigger boundary might be saying that you want to spend time with her but that she has to call before she comes over and she can only visit you on thursdays remember that your mother wanting to spend time with you or do things with you isn t inherently selfish it is only selfish if she refuses to acknowledge your needs and desires when you talk to her about them often some clear communication will make both of you happy let your mom know that you mean business when you talk to her about her selfish behavior so that she can better understand the gravity of the situation assertive communication is not the same thing as aggressive communication rather it involves being direct and open about your feelings thoughts and beliefs in a way that is respectful of others needs and points of view don t say something less assertive such as mom sometimes you may do things that seem to focus more on you than on other people i could be wrong but it seems that way to me maybe we can talk about it sometime instead be more assertive with something along the lines of mom i feel hurt when you make inflexible demands of me even when i have other plans i want to talk to you about this i think we can have a better relationship than we currently do i am willing to put in the effort if you are you can avoid being unassertive by changing the way you think prior to speaking avoid thinking things such as i should keep quiet because i don t want to burden mom with my thoughts or it could be embarrassing or awkward if i say what i think instead think more assertive thoughts such as i have the right to say disagree with what mom thinks sometimes family problems are too difficult to solve on their own and it can be much easier more efficient productive and helpful to get outside assistance to deal with the underlying issues if you suggest family counseling bring it up with your mother as the family having relationship issues that you think could use improvement do not put the entire blame or emphasis on her selfish people fail to remember that relationships are not destined to permanency relationships of any nature involve some give and take some reciprocal back and forth if your mother is selfish let her know the specific ways she treats you that you dislike and tell her that if she does not change you will not be able to be around her or treat her like a mom anymore this may work better if you are an adult or no longer live with your mother save this as a last result assuming it is an option for you sometimes you cannot salvage a relationship even with your own mother keep that in mind as you attempt to navigate the tricky situation that you are in if you live at home and do not have the means to move out rather than letting your selfish mother get you down make a focused plan for how to move out of the house or do well in school so that when the time comes you can position yourself in a way that will allow you to remove yourself from the negative situation you are in if you are a parent and have a family of your own cut your losses with your mother and focus instead on being the most loving parent to your children that you can be turn her negative into your positive let yourself grieve if in evaluating your situation it seems that your relationship with your mother is dead or dying allow yourself time to process this losing a mother to her own selfishness self absorption or narcissism is a very real and painful experience do not deny the idea that it is a serious issue instead allow yourself to feel sorry but then focus on actionable goal directed change and improvement for how to improve your situation and your feelings 
query	15	use the near future tense spanish the spanish language includes three ways to talk about the future simple future tense typically is used when you re talking about actions that are going to happen further off in the future such as next week or next month to use the near future tense in spanish you would either use the informal future tense or simply use the present tense the informal future tense is similar to english in that you say you are going to do something 1 constructing informal future tense using present tense trying simple future tense conjugate the verb ir pronounced like ear add the word a pronounced ah finish your phrase with the infinitive determine whether the future action is certain conjugate the verb in present tense add a word or phrase to indicate timing form the verb in simple future tense memorize irregular verbs in future tense use simple future tense to wonder or make assumptions make predictions about the future in simple future tense the spanish verb ir means to go when constructing the informal future tense to talk about something that s going to happen in the near future conjugate this verb in the present indicative to agree with the subject of the sentence in the first person ir is voy in spanish yo voy means i am going if the sentence you are writing is in second person you would write t vas too vahs which means you are going for a singular third person subject such as l or ella you would say va as in l va ell vah or ella va ay yah vah remember that spanish has a formal and informal you conjugate ir as you would with a third person subject if you are using the pronoun usted first person plural nosotros we is vamos no so trohs vah mohs second person plural ustedes you all is van oo stay days vahn with third person plural ellos or ellas ir is conjugated the same your readers or listeners will understand the subject from the context of the sentence in english infinitives include the word to think to walk or to drive spanish infinitives don t necessarily include this word so if you want to say you are going to do something in the near future you must include a after the verb ir a means to in spanish for example if you wanted to say i am going to learn spanish you would say voy a aprender espa ol boy ah ah pren day ess pan yohl keep in mind that in spanish you simply use the present tense for continuous actions that are taking place in the present and the future while in english you would say i am going to the store to indicate that you were on your way to the store in spanish you would simply say ir a la tienda ear ah la tee end ah literally translates as i go to the store the infinitive expresses the action that the subject of the sentence is going to do at some point in the near future the entire phrase is a lot like english when you say you are going to do something for example if you wanted to say i am going to study a lot in spanish you would say yo voy a estudiar mucho yo boy ah ess too dee ahr moo choh you also can add a word or phrase to indicate when the action is going to take place for example yo voy a estudiar mucho ma ana yo boy ah ess too dee ahr moo choh mahn yahn ah i am going to study a lot tomorrow in spanish unlike in english you don t use the future tense to talk about actions that are certain to happen in the future instead you typically would use present tense this rule applies both to the informal future tense and the simple future tense use present tense when the action is certain or when it is going to happen very soon in the near future when in doubt try simply using present tense a spanish speaker typically will understand what you mean but if your reader or listener doesn t understand they can ask for clarification using present tense to indicate future actions is relatively simple provided you already know how to conjugate the verb you simply make it agree with the number and gender of the subject of the sentence in present indicative tense for example if you say te veo en la escuela tay vay oh in lah ess kway lah you are literally saying i see you at school however if the person to whom you re speaking is a classmate and you are talking to them over the weekend they will understand that you mean i will see you at school since the two of you are not at school at the moment since you re using present tense your listener or reader may assume that the action is taking place right now unless you tell them specifically when it will take place to return to the previous example if the classmate to whom you were speaking was someone with a different class schedule than yours you might say te veo ma ana en la escuela or i will see you tomorrow at school to indicate that you will be on campus tomorrow you also use present tense for events that are scheduled to take place or that are certain to take place in those instances the even may occur further in the future for example you would use present tense to say me caso el 6 de mayo may cah soh ell says day my yoh i am getting married on may 6 literal translation i marry on may 6 even if that date is several months into the future when you conjugate verbs in simple future tense in spanish all you have to do is add the correct ending onto the infinitive form of the verb there s no need to remove the ending to get to the verb stem as when you conjugate in other tenses the simple future endings are s emos is and n the accent mark indicates that you should place emphasis on the last syllable when you say the word when you add one of these endings to a verb stem you are saying the same thing in spanish that you would be saying in english if you said something will happen in the future for example take the spanish infinitive escribir ess cree veer meaning to write you would conjugate this verb in simple future tense as yo escribir i will write t escribir s you will write usted l ella excribir formal you he she will write nosotros escribiremos we will write vosotros escriber is you all will write note that this pronoun is only used in spain and ustedes llos ellas escribir n you all they will write in some spanish verbs the spelling of the verb stem changes when you add the ending for simple future tense about a dozen of these verbs are relatively common verbs that you may find yourself using frequently typically you change the verb stem by adding a consonant to it for example when forming the simple future tense of the verb haber pronounced ah vair meaning to have you add an r yo habr yo ah vray i will have in other irregular verbs you substitute one consonant for another for example for the verb hacer pronounced ah sear meaning to do or to make you exchange the c for an r to make the simple future tense yo har yo ah ray i will make find a list of these irregular verbs there are many available free online from spanish language websites and memorize the ones you believe you will use frequently return to this list when you encounter a verb you don t know if you make assumptions or wonder about something in english you typically use present tense although you can use future tense in some circumstances but spanish is different simple future tense is most often used in spanish to express a probability that something is happening in the present or to speculate or guess about the present for example if it s close to lunch time and you re speculating that the children might be hungry you would say los ni os tendr n hambre lohs neen yos ten drahn ahm bray meaning the children might be hungry or literally the children will have hunger note that this sentence uses the verb tener to have to be which is irregular in simple future tense if you re unsure about something taking place in the present and are wondering aloud about it you also use simple future tense for example if you re getting ready to go out but can t find your keys you might say d nde estar n mis llaves dohn day ess tay rahn mees yah vays meaning where could my keys be or literally where will my keys be the future tense in spanish recognizes that you can t literally predict the future if you believe something will happen in the future but have no guarantee that it will take place use the simple future tense for example if you have a well educated and experienced friend who is currently seeking employment you might say encontrar un trabajo bueno in cohnt rah rah oon trah bah hoh boo way no in english he will find a good job you have reason to believe that this will happen but there is no guarantee

query	17	understand the cat s meow cats can be very vocal creatures they may meow for a variety of reasons your cat may meow if it wants something like attention or food a cat may also meow in response to distress or anger if you want to understand your cat s meowing pay attention to the circumstances surrounding the meowing and the actual noise your cat makes with a little detective work you should be able to figure out why your cat is meowing evaluating the situation considering the type of meowing responding to the meowing watch your cat s body language consider whether your cat wants something think about when the meowing is occurring weigh in recent changes consider if your cat is spayed or neutered think about your cat s age evaluate the length of the meow listen to the tone of the meow pay attention to chattering noises listen for signs of distress check if your cat needs something do not punish a cat for meowing talk to a vet about sudden or excessive meowing accept certain cats simply meow more than others cat s meows can be confusing as they may meow for a variety of different reasons while a cat may meow to get your attention it may also meow as a warning you can pay attention to your cat s body language to help read the meowing pay attention to how your cat reacts to you when it is meowing does it arch its back and rub up against you does it reach its head up to meet your hand when you reach down to pet it if so your cat may be meowing because it wants your affection conversely meowing may be a sign of aggression or fear if your cat cowers when meowing and ducks away from your touch it may be meowing because it s distressed your cat may meow while engaging in other behaviors these behaviors may indicate the cat wants something it may be trying to get you to do something for example if your cat is meowing while running to the kitchen it wants to be fed if your cat is meowing by the door to your bedroom it wants to go in the bedroom cats often signal what they need in other ways while they meow if you pay attention to what your cat is doing while it meows you may be able to figure out why it is meowing cats may meow at specific points in the day this can help you pinpoint the reason for the meowing meowing that occurs near dinner time for example probably means your cat wants food meowing that occurs when you first get home is probably a greeting you should also pay attention to where your cat is when it meows cats dislike being alone for long periods if your cat meows when it s alone in a room it may be meowing out of loneliness meowing is often the expression of a benign emotion or need however meowing can be in response to stress think about any recent changes to your home consider whether these could be the cause of your cat s meowing cats may get stressed in response to a recent move a new pet a new baby or any other big changes if your household has undergone major changes recently your cat may be meowing out of stress if you can adjust the cause of the stress this may cut back on the meowing for example if your cat dislikes its new bed switching back to an old bed can help however some changes like a recent move cannot be undone in this case give your cat extra love and attention as it adjusts to the changes if your cat has not been fixed meowing is often hormonal female cats will yowl in heat in attempt to find mates male cats will yowl if they smell a female in heat nearby as such noise can be frustrating to live with consider spaying or neutering your cat to cut back on unwanted meowing if your cat is getting older it may meow more a cat may meow if it becomes confused due to deteriorating senses it may be a good idea to have an elderly cat evaluated by a vet to make sure it does not have any major health problems causing excessive meowing the duration of the meow may indicate what the cat is trying to express shorter meows tend to indicate your cat wants something such as food or attention longer drawn out meows especially if they re throatier in nature tend to indicate your cat is annoyed or stressed by something a long and very drawn out moaning noise is almost always an indication of distress if you hear your cat yowling you should check in on it to make sure it s okay the frequency of meowing can also indicate what your cat is communicating many meows fired off in quick succession usually indicate your cat is trying to get your attention you can tell a lot about a cat s meow by tuning into tone you may hear purring or rumbling noises alongside a meow this usually indicate a happy meow squeaky meows or meows that sound like chirps usually indicate your cat is happy to see you in rare occasions purring can actually indicate distress focus on your cat s body language when it purrs if your cat seems tense and is keeping its ears back it may be purring out of distress if a cat clicks its teeth when meowing making a kind of chattering sound this is usually an indication of predatory excitement a cat may chatter when looking at a bird outside or stalking a small bug in your home a chatter can also indicate distress if your cat is chattering out the window for example it may be frustrated it cannot get at a bird or other prey cats often meow if they re injured or in pain long shrill yowling meows may indicate something wrong very loud meows can also be an indication of stress or pain excessive yowling with no identifiable cause should be evaluated by a vet meowing should never be entirely ignored you do not want to encourage excessive meowing but you should always check to make sure your cat does not need anything if you hear it meowing a cat may for example be trapped in a room or be unable to reach its litter boxes you should make sure your cat is not in need when you hear it meowing never scold hit or punish a cat in any way for meowing if you want your cat to not meow for breakfast in the morning ignore the behavior instead of punishing it cats do not respond well to punishment a cat is unlikely to realize why it is being punished and will only become stressed if you punish your cat for meowing it can create a stressful environment that can lead to other behavioral problems your cat may start meowing excessively suddenly in this case take it to a vet immediately unexplained meowing can often be a sign your cat is injured or sick you should never ignore unusual meowing in a cat that s normally quiet if you re dealing with a new cat you may be confused by excessive meowing if the meowing does not sound distressed or frightened it is probably okay certain cats are simply more vocal than others your new cat may simply feel the need to communicate through meowing more frequently

query	19	prepare your daughter for her first period it probably seems like your baby girl was just born and now she s getting ready to have her first period this time in her life is both exciting and a little scary it s a great idea to help your daughter prepare for her first period so she s comfortable that she has everything she needs when it finally happens most girls will get their first periods around the ages of 12 or 13 but some girls will get their periods as early as 8 or 9 years of age the best way to tell that your daughter might be getting her period soon is whether she needs a real bra and or if she has pubic or armpit hair once these things start to appear her first period will probably only be 3 to 6 months away 1 discussing your daughter s menstrual cycle teaching your daughter how to handle her period supporting your daughter for her first period understand your daughter s concerns and fears help educate your daughter about her menstrual cycle discuss the mechanics of the menstrual cycle to your daughter avoid having the talk while it may seem like a good idea to have the talk in reality conversations about your daughter s menstrual cycle should be ongoing try not to focus too much on the downside of having a period talk to your daughter about sexual intercourse explain to your daughter how to use a sanitary pad talk to your daughter about tampons teach your daughter how to track her period inform your daughter about keeping clean teach your daughter that it s important to change her pad or tampon often create a period kit arrange for a trusted adult to help take your daughter to see her doctor getting your first period is a scary and exciting event your daughter will likely have a number of questions about what it will be like and what she should do if you are a woman you should be able to answer based on your personal experience including what it was like to have your first period when you were younger if you re a man you ll need to decide if you want to answer these questions yourself or if you d like to enlist the help of a woman to answer the questions for your daughter for men keep in mind that while you may want to be supportive of your daughter she may be uncomfortable talking to you about her period the best approach is to ask her specifically what she d prefer she may have a specific female she d like to speak with that you can help arrange there are so many great resources that both you and your daughter can use to learn more about a woman s menstrual cycle for example there are many books written specifically for girls your daughter s age about getting a period you may want to review these resources in advance to make sure they re providing accurate and up to date information and that they don t contain any information you do not want your daughter to read besides searching online for possible books check out your local library and ask your librarian for suggestions you can also contact your daughter s doctor to see if they have any resources they d recommend an example of a great website that could be used to help explain the menstrual cycle is kidshealth org search youtube and other websites for well done educational and accurate videos about menstruation that may be useful to show your daughter if you re daughter asks you a question about menstruation that you don t know the answer to say so and then promise to find the answer and get back to her it might be useful to know when your daughter will be having health or sex education classes at school so you can follow up with additional conversations at home if you can speak to her teacher and ask for the material to be used so you re prepared for any questions she may have going through the physiological details of what happens when your daughter has her period can be a great way for her to better understand how her body is functioning this conversation should also include discussing myths or rumours she may have heard and helping her sort out what is true and what isn t this explanation may be more successful if you use diagrams of the female reproductive system so your daughter can visualize what s actually happening be sure to include an explanation that your daughter s menstrual cycle lasts around 28 days and that while she may have her period for only a week or so within those 28 days there s still plenty of other activities happening in her body before and after her period explaining the 28 day cycle may also be a good time to explain that her period won t be the same every single day that she has it it may start out very light then get heavier then lighten up again near the end you could use this opportunity to explain that there are difference feminine hygiene products available for different days of her period if she needs them this discussion is also a great time to explain that no two girls or women are the same when it comes to their periods she may experience something completely different from her friends or sisters and not to use that difference to think something is wrong with her your daughter should know that she can talk to you about the topic anytime she wants to not just during a special talk therefore it s better to have lots of smaller conversations about her body over time starting early plus trying to inform your daughter about everything she needs to know in only one conversation can be overwhelming it will be easier for her to remember the information if you talk about it multiple times any talks about your daughter s body should start when she s really young any time she asks a question about her body or the human body in general you should talk openly with her and answer honestly it s also important that you ensure your daughter has the correct information and not rumours or myths that might be discussed amongst her friends look for various ways to segue into a conversation about menstruation such as commercials for female hygiene products walking down the aisle with female hygiene products a scene in a movie or tv show etc most women will know that getting your period brings a lot of other issues such as bloating irritability cramps etc however your daughter doesn t need to know all the terrible details in advance instead explain some of the common symptoms she may experience and explain how she can help alleviate them e g heating pad ibuprofen etc keep in mind that not all girls will experience the same symptoms and they may not all experience those symptoms right away explaining every possible negative aspect of a period may only cause additional fears and worries that are unnecessary always try to keep conversations about menstruation as positive as possible technically speaking girls can get pregnant even before their first period before her first period an egg will be released from her ovaries and make its way down to her uterus anytime between when the egg is released until her period begins she could technically get pregnant not only is it important that she understand this but also that once she has her period becoming pregnant from sexual intercourse is a definite possibility how you go about having such a conversation is up to you based on your personal beliefs you may want to take the time to explain what protection is available i e condoms birth control etc and how effective each type can typically be you may want to explain that having sexual intercourse can also lead to sexually transmitted diseases stds which can cause short and long term health problems this type of conversation might work well when your daughter is also being taught similar topics in a health or sex ed class prepare your daughter with instructions on how to use a sanitary pad explain or show her how it gets attached to underwear and what to do with used pads also ensure your daughter realizes she should change her pad every 4 to 6 hours at the very least but can change it anytime she wants before her first period you should have your daughter try out a pad by putting it on and taking it off just so she s use to it when the time comes make sure your daughter understands that pads cannot be flushed in a toilet but instead that they should be disposed of in the special receptacle in a bathroom stall she s probably already seen these receptacles so it should be easy to explain what they look like using a tampon for her first period is probably not a good idea simply because the situation will be overwhelming enough without needing to figure out how to use a tampon after her first period or even after her first few periods talk to your daughter to determine if she s interested in using tampons if she is show her diagrams of how to use tampons to help your verbal explanation make sense you could also show your daughter some youtube videos on tampon use created by young girls seeing other young girls properly explain tampon use may make it less scary to try make sure to alleviate any fears of a tampon being lost inside your daughter s body by explaining that anatomically speaking a tampon has no where to go use a diagram if it helps be sure to explain that a tampon should be changed every 4 hours if she s unable to change a tampon every 4 hours for example if she s concerned about using tampons at school suggest she use sanitary pads while away from home explain that a full menstrual cycle lasts from day 1 of one period until day 1 of the next period which is also usually 28 days in length this means she can mark the first day of her period on a calendar and then count forward 28 days she can mark on the calendar the 28th day so she knows that her next period should come somewhere around that day ensure she realizes that not all periods follow this cycle precisely so it could start before or after this date as well some women experience cycles that are only 22 days long or as long as 45 days these differences are normal and are nothing for you or your daughter to be worried about let your daughter know that if she tracks her period via a calendar she may be able to notice a pattern that s specific to her knowing if she has a specific cycle length will help her predict when her next period will begin explain to your daughter that once she gets her period it ll be a good idea to have a shower everyday and pay extra attention to cleaning her labia although you also need to let her know that no special products or soap are required to clean her labia all she needs is the warm water from a shower having a bath is actually the best method for cleaning during a period not only does it clean well it can help alleviate cramps or pains your daughter should know that there s no such thing as changing your pad or tampon too often however she should at least change her pad every 4 to 6 hours and her tampon every 4 hours explain that leaving a pad on for too long can cause problems due to the dampness being close to her skin for too long also explain that leaving a tampon in for too long can result in toxic shock syndrome the purpose isn t to scare your daughter but just to give her good educated reasons why she needs to make sure she changes her pad or tampon regularly because it s difficult to predict when your daughter will have her first period one thing you can help your daughter with is to create a period kit having such a kit will help make her feel more comfortable that she s ready whenever or wherever it may happen your daughter can keep this kit with her at all times in her purse or backpack a period kit should include a couple teen sized sanitary pads and a clean pair of underwear you may also want to include a plastic baggie of wipes so she can clean herself if needed while she may eventually want to try tampons putting tampons in her kit is probably not a good idea since she might be uncomfortable using them right away you can add them to her period kit later when she s use to them tell your daughter not to worry if a pair of underwear is ruined and that she can feel free to throw them out if she s concerned about her clothes being stained help her keep a spare pair of pants in her locker or backpack to help make her more comfortable since there s a good chance you daughter will get her first period while at school or at an extracurricular activity speak to her about having a trusted adult she could go to if she needed help this person may be a teacher a school nurse or counsellor a coach or even an older student explain to your daughter that all women understand what it s like to not only get a first period but what it s like to get a period suddenly and unexpectedly and that there s no need to be afraid to ask another woman for help also explain to your daughter that she should help other girls who might be having period troubles for example if she notices a friend who may be leaking she should feel comfortable enough to tell that friend once your daughter starts her period her doctor should be informed at the next visit however there s no need to visit the doctor specifically because her period has started unless she has a problem if you daughter experiences any issues such as those listed below make an appointment to see her doctor and have the doctor assess the issue your daughter has pain when a tampon is being inserted your daughter has a period that comes more often than every 21 days or less often than every 45 days your daughter has a period that lasts longer than 7 days your daughter has bleeding between periods your daughter experiences heavy periods or cramps that cannot be alleviated by regular over the counter medications your daughter is 15 years of age and has not yet had her first period your daughter has shown significant signs of puberty for 3 years but has not yet had her first period

thirty minutes sleep inertia leads to disorientation and grogginess which can last for half an hour in order to function properly keep naps thirty minutes or less ramadan means a new change of routine for both you and your meals make a schedule to indicate the timings of when suhoor is when it s time to break your fast and so forth you can create one yourself but many mosque communities create them too so you can print one out to follow your community s timing during ramadan having suhoor and iftar with the family is a common tradition and eating as a group brings more blessing to the meal you may want to start grocery shopping for some foods to prepare big meals for the family be sure to buy dates too in order to break your fast you must eat a date or drink water it s highly encouraged to break your fast with dates though so be sure to buy some when grocery shopping create a grocery shopping list to keep track of what foods you need to buy for ramadan ask a parent or family member to help you shop and buy the food before fasting try to train yourself to eat healthier eat a wide variety of vegetables and fruits such as salads be sure to also eat plenty of protein grains and dairy having nutritional meals before fasting will help make it easier for you to avoid junk food cravings create a list of ramadan goals you want to accomplish during this special month you might want to make a goal of fasting the whole month of ramadan or trying to at least fast for part of it having it as a goal will motivate you to fast and encourage you to attempt fasting have the intention niyyah to fast before starting to do so this is to ensure that you re serious about fasting and will try your best to do it have the intention to fast by telling yourself i am going to fast the month of ramadan with the help of allah suhoor is a meal eaten before fajr the morning prayer before dawn comes eating suhoor is sunnah meaning it s highly encouraged to do so in order to follow the prophet muhammad s actions but there is no sin on you if you skip it it was narrated that anas ibn maalik said the prophet saw said eat suhoor for in suhoor there is blessing suhoor has been known to give you strength throughout the day when fasting it can minimize thirst prevent headaches and avoid making you feel sick when you fast it s highly encouraged not to miss out this meal before fasting try to stick to simple nutritious meals that have plenty of proteins carbohydrates vitamins and minerals rice bread pasta salads dates fruits crackers and soup are all good options avoid salty greasy foods and extremely sweet desserts this increases thirst and could cause you to feel dehydrated drink plenty of water during suhoor to keep yourself hydrated when fasting after eating suhoor have the niyyah intention to fast the entire day by telling yourself i intend to observe my fast for today you can also make dua to allah so he can help make the fast easy for you and so that he can accept your worship to him the most common dua said for suhoor is wa bi sawmi ghadin nawaytu min shahri ramadan which means in english i intend to keep the fast for tomorrow in the month of ramadan throughout the day try to participate in different acts of worship ramadan is the month known for mercy and forgiveness so doing acts of worship is an important part of this month read the quran attend islamic halaqas gatherings for teenagers listen to islamic lectures do tasbeeh make dua help out around the house give charity and pray any extra salahs when you re asleep you won t feel hungry and your body won t be burning as many calories try taking a few cat naps throughout the day to help ease off hunger it s recommended to take naps that are less than thirty minutes to avoid sleep inertia taking naps longer can cause you to feel groggy when you wake up try taking a nap in the afternoon it s the best time to recharge your body for the evening when you fast you don t have as much as energy due to the lack of food and water avoid over working yourself and stay away from hot climates to keep from being dehydrated light exercise is okay but try your best not to use too much energy you don t want to harm yourself by exercising on an empty stomach if you do have to go outside when it s hot keep yourself safe stay under shades whenever possible and keep a fan with you to stay cool keeping yourself preoccupied will help you from thinking about hunger do a hobby talk to a friend watch a video clean up draw or do some type of easy going and relaxing activity that will keep you from thinking about food try to have a busy schedule with plenty of activities to do being bored a lot will cause you think about food and make you hungry there are plenty of temptations and triggers that make us think about food try to stay away from areas where people eat food and where food is available you should also try to avoid looking at pictures of food hearing or watching people eat and smelling food cooking for example you might go to the library instead of the cafeteria so you won t be tempted to eat once the sun sets and the magrib salah evening prayer is announced it s time to break your fast before breaking your fast make dua to allah to accept your fast and pray for other things you desire during this period of time all duas are accepted when you re ready to break your fast eat a date or drink water the prophet muhammad saw said when one of you is fasting he should break his fast with dates but if he cannot get any then he should break his fast with water for water is purifying once you ve broken your fast you can eat a bit and take more sips of water you can choose to eat iftar right away or pray magrib first praying first is encouraged however because after eating iftar you re usually full and feel too tired to pray there are many different duas you can say when breaking your fast but the most common one is dhahaba al zama wa abtalat al urooqu wa thabata al ajr in sha allah which means in english the thirst is gone the veins are moistened and the reward is confirmed if allah wills try to eat with your family if you can as it s known to bring baraka blessing while eating follow the same rulings you would do when normally eating food don t eat too much or too fast as that could harm your body this is especially important since you ve fasted all day giving your stomach too much food to digest after it hasn t been used all day is very unsafe when eating eat slowly and use proper table manners as though you were a guest in someone s house this will help you avoid eating too quickly which can cause nausea once you ve finished eating iftar help clean up by clearing the table and or washing the dishes try to help your parents prepare food for suhoor the next day once you ve fasted your first day in ramadan you ll realize the benefits and blessings of fasting and the beautify of ramadan as a muslim teen drink plenty of water during the night before suhoor to keep from dehydrating yourself the next fast 
query	21	read shakespeare for beginners reading shakespeare s works will be fun but it can be a confusing and frustrating experience for the beginner partially because of shakespeare s style and the difference in language between now and tudor england in which shakespeare lived but with a few steps and some preparation you ll be well equipped and ready to enjoy reading a play in no time selecting your text and preparing yourself reading the text going above and beyond select a play choose a good edition familiarize yourself with the most frequent shakespearisms language is always evolving and some of the words in shakespeare s plays have a different meaning today than when the plays were written or they are no longer in use understand shakespeare s use of grammar enjoy shakespeare s

be familiar with to start most editions will have a brief synopsis printed on the back cover if the play sounds intriguing it might make for a good selection romeo and juliet is often a good starting point because many of us are familiar with the star crossed lovers plot consider a comedy like taming of the shrew a play which has been adapted to film for modern audiences macbeth is another popular shakespearean tragedy and if you are interested in political intrigue this might be the play for you there are two major choices to make the first choice is between texts that have been modernized to smooth over the differences in language use from shakespeare s time to our own time or texts that have not been modernized the second choice is between texts that are annotated or non annotated annotated texts may provide definitions context and value added information that will help you to form a deeper understanding of what is going on in the play the no fear shakespeare series is a good option that offers the original text side by side with modernized text remember that modernized text should support understanding and not replace the original popular annotated versions are available by arden and oxford non annotated texts will provide just the text as it was originally written when in doubt use the context of the sentence to figure out the meaning or reference an online shakespearean glossary here are some examples thee as you for example when will i see thee next thou as you for example thou art a villain thy as your for example thy name is more hateful than thy face hath as has for example he hath killed many a man or he hath a horse in shakespeare s writing parts of speech are frequently switched and normal sentence order is often varied often for the sake of rhyme or meter which is like rhythm shakespeare often played with standard language some common features include nouns or adjectives used as verbsverbs and subjects which don t agreeomitted or implied wordsword endings such as ly applied inconsistentlytricky sentence construction for instance where we say john caught the ball shakespeare might write john the ball caught or even the ball john caught in shakespeare s writing metaphors and similes may make some passages more difficult to understand shakespeare also heavily used puns double meanings and malapropisms for comedic effect an example of a shakespearean metaphor compares life to the theatre stage all the world s a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts an example of a shakespearean pun after hamlet has killed polonius and hidden his body the king asks him where polonius is hamlet tells him he is at supper not where he eats but where he is eaten meaning that polonius is the supper for worms an example of a shakespearean malapropism officer dogberry said our watch sir have indeed comprehended two auspicious persons

query	23	write a young adult novel young adult fiction is one of the most rapidly expanding and exciting categories in which you you can write and publish although many people think young adult novels are only written for teenagers they have a much broader audience and appeal while engaging a young adult audience can be a challenge you can make your novel a success by avoiding common mistakes planning your novel carefully and adapting your writing style avoiding common mistakes planning your young adult novel writing for a young adult audience ditch the idea that young adult is a genre don t make the mistake of thinking that young adult novels are easier to write stop dumbing down your writing tackle dark serious or edgy topics don t just make things up get excited study young adult novels focus on developing your characters research the setting identify the source of conflict in your novel be aware of length ask young adults for their feedback think like a young adult emphasize what it feels like to be a teenager be careful with pop culture references and slang get the voice down don t try to be too elaborate with your writing style think carefully about the age of your characters show character growth and development don t try to preach to your audience embrace a flair for the dramatic make the ending somewhat hopeful although bookstores and publishers use the phrase young adult as a marketing category it is not necessarily a genre a young adult novel could represent any genre such as science fiction mystery horror romance historical fiction or fantasy this is one aspect of writing young adult fiction that many authors find appealing you are not restricted to one specific genre and instead can write books in different genres or books that cross genres writing any type of book requires hard work and young adult novels are no exception many writers have also reported that these books can be more challenging to write because young adults can be picky readers and are looking for very authentic and original stories writing a young adult novel can be especially difficult if you are no longer considered a young adult it s hard to find a voice and adopt a tone that young adults can relate to also keep in mind that many novels that end up being marketed as young adult books or are popular among young adults were not necessarily written with that intent unfortunately some people believe that young adults novels are watered down or dumbed down versions of adult fiction just because the protagonist in the novel is a young adult does not mean you should feel like you are writing for children while your prose and the quality of your writing should be engaging your readers don t want something simplistic young adults want to be treated like adults and you may alienate your audience if you use writing that is too simple or childish also remember that many adults read and enjoy books that fall in the young adult category think about how many adults read series such as harry potter or the hunger games if your writing and content are too basic and elementary you will lose this group as potential readers many people mistakenly assume that young adult novels should be light and breezy with no exploration of difficult subject matter successful young adult authors however are ones willing to address and examine how serious issues in our society affect young adults these topics may include but are not limited to abuse sex gender identity drugs rape incest suicide racism discrimination violence and genocide while creativity is encouraged in young adult fiction don t assume you can make things up and get away with it if you are talking about or referring to real people places events or products you need to do your homework young adults are savvy readers and can easily sniff out uninformed and inaccurate descriptions opinions and details for example if you are writing a book that talks about video game culture get the details about the games and the culture of this community right to write a young adult novel you need to feel excited about the opportunities of writing in this category here are some things to keep in mind the field of young adult fiction is expanding authors often find that they face fewer restrictions about what they write about because young adults celebrate creativity and imagination young adults can also be a more open minded and supportive audience people outside the young adult range will likely read and enjoy your book as an author of young adult novels you have the opportunity to write a book that makes an impact on someone and influences how he or she looks at the world if you want to write young adult books reading successful young adult novels is an excellent way to start pay close attention to the structure dialogue plot and character development make notes about any ideas you come up with for your novel while reading other books interesting and engaging characters are essential for a young adult novel spend time thinking about and developing your characters before you sit down to write or move on to other parts of the novel such as the plot or setting for each character you create make a list of his or her history background hobbies relationships tastes and personality traits although not all of these details will make it in to the book you will develop well rounded and three dimensional characters that young adults can relate to don t neglect the villains or minor characters in your story you never know what details you might need or the changes you will make to your plot now that you ve developed a full cast of characters you probably have a better idea of where and when your story will take place spend time thinking about the setting of your novel and conduct any research on the time period or location that inspires you remember you are not limited to present day or real world locations many successful young adult novels take place in the genres of fantasy and science fiction there is also a healthy market for historical fiction the characters in every novel confront some kind of conflict and this holds true for young adult books while the specific conflict will be shaped by your characters setting and genre the characters need to confront issues that your audience can relate to with young adults conflicts and struggles often arise over love relationships personal freedom peer or family pressure a search for identity taking on new roles and responsibilities and dealing with high school college and career choices while young adults can be voracious readers you will lose some potential audience members if your book is too long although many young adult novels exceed this limit most books in this category are between 50 000 to 70 000 words the pacing in young adult novels is often fast with lots of dialogue some people think they resemble extended screenplays as opposed to a longer slower adult novel remember if the book or story you are crafting seems much longer than this you can always contemplate breaking it up into separate books and creating a series you want your book to be as successful as possible and appeal to the intended audience so it s a smart move to ask young adults to provide feedback on your work if you are no longer a young adult but are writing a young adult novel this exercise can help you gain insight into the language feelings and concerns of your audience you will also be better able to recall what it feels like to be a teenager regardless of your age you will have to think like a young adult and try to get in your characters mindset in order to craft a novel that is believable and relatable to a young adult audience pay careful attention to how you narrate the book so you do not seem to be writing this from the perspective of an adult looking back on their teenage years with the wisdom and maturity that comes with age if you are no longer a young adult you will have to be careful about the decisions feelings and emotions your characters make ask yourself if this is something a young adult would actually do or if your hindsight and experience are making your characters and the story less relatable to a young adult audience if you are looking for insight into a young adult audience check out online forums centered around young adult novels you will get a better sense of the opinions views and perspectives of people you want to read and enjoy your work although the characters in your young adult novel may be very different from you readers and writers have argued that successful books are those that capture the emotional experience of being a young adult for example even though readers may not identify with the specific struggle a main character in a young adult novel is dealing with they will probably relate to his or her search for identity and meaning in the world references to pop culture and the use of slang can help you develop your characters and make them more personable but they can also date your novel and you as an author many successful young adult authors recommend using pop culture references and slang sparingly to help you establish the setting and provide specific insight into characters excessive use of pop culture references and slang however may make the novel difficult for readers to understand and relate to in the future references to technology for example quickly become obsolete overdoing the pop culture and slang can also distract from the storyline and the novel s central conflict if you decide to use pop culture references or slang in your novel make sure you provide sufficient context that a reader can figure out what you are referring to many years down the road finding and adopting the right voice for your young adult novel can be daunting while there are no set rules many young adult novels are written in the first person present tense and are narrated from the perspective of a young person revealing intimate details about his or her life many young adult readers according to writers and editors are looking for a story that is told in a personal and accessible way although adult characters may be present in the book the novels usually do not emphasize their perspective and readers often identify most with the main character when you start writing your young adult novel you may feel like you need to be particularly poetic and creative but many successful young adult writers have reported that people of all ages are attracted to their work because the writing style is more direct straightforward and simple this doesn t mean that you should throw writing and grammar rules out the window but realize that your audience often communicates more bluntly and to the point writing like a snobby philosopher won t help you craft a compelling novel that young adults and people of all ages can relate to the age of your characters will influence who reads your novel and how they react to it they may be excited to read a book about a character a few years older but young adults are usually reluctant to read books about characters younger than they are so make sure your characters age is appropriate for your intended audience the age range of main characters in young adult novels is usually mid to upper teens if you envisioned a protagonist as younger you might want to evaluate whether your book is a better fit for a middle grade audience the main characters in these books are usually 10 to 12 years old and the middle grade demographic is 8 to 12 years old at their core most young adult books are coming of age stories that trace characters transition to adulthood as a result young adult authors have to demonstrate how their characters experience personal growth and change over the course of the novel the appeal of coming of age stories and personal growth is one of the elements that make young adult books so popular to audiences of all ages this is something we can all relate to anyone who has been a young adult or is often around young adults knows that they just like adults do not appreciate being told what to do avoid writing a novel with the intention of teaching your audience lessons you think are important it s okay for your views and opinions to be apparent in the way you write the novel but you can usually make your audience think critically about a topic by simply raising a question or introducing an issue it s not your responsibility as a writer to provide an answer to the question instead let your audience explore and grapple with the topic on their own time and in their own way while older adults may dismiss teenagers as overly dramatic and emotional you will need to embrace this tendency if you want to be a successful young adult author when you are a young adult everything that happens to you can seem and feel life changing and very important young adults because of how their bodies and brains are developing and changing feel things intensely to capture that quality you have to be able to dramatize things that some people might regard as trivial in your book for example a grade on a science test a glance from a boy you are attracted to and a snicker in gym class can seem incredibly important to young adults while young adult books can definitely explore topics that leave readers feeling raw and emotional successful young adult novels also offer readers some glimpse of optimism or the sense that things can and will improve for the characters you don t have to make the ending a happy or rosy one and tragedy can occur in the book just try to leave readers with a sense that there is some chance for survival growth and happiness one of the reasons many adults are drawn to young adult novels is that they often provide more resolution or a reason for optimism than adult fiction for example if you are writing a book about a geeky student in high school you don t have to include a triumphant but unrealistic ending where the nerd turns into the most popular student in school you can however suggest that the unpopular student meets and befriends new people feeling less isolated in the end

part of who you are instead you need to focus on yourself mentally separate yourself from your obsession by considering what other areas of your life contribute to who you are think about tasks roles or jobs that reward you as much as your obsession is your obsession based on a fantasy or idealized version of a person or activity you need to start seeing how the obsession has served or fulfilled you before you can begin to fulfill that need in other ways for example if you re currently in a romantic relationship but obsess over a co worker who flirts with you you might need to refocus your attention on making your relationship fun again become aware of yourself and your surroundings without judgement to do this tune in to each one of your senses while you also pay attention to your physical or emotional state for example notice if your body is tense you feel fatigued or you re content with your life even being mindful for small periods of time can help you become more aware of

you to start meeting them relying less on your obsession you may be constantly obsessing to stop these obsessive thoughts from interfering with your life tell yourself that you ll only obsess at certain times of the day put it off for the moment and tell yourself you can obsess later you might find that your mind relaxes enough to forget to obsess for example if you start to obsess over something when you re out with your friends remind yourself to enjoy the moment and tell yourself you can always obsess when you get home if you re obsessing over a challenge or problem try to solve it brainstorm a list of options so you feel like you have options if you have trouble seeing potential solutions talk with other people who have experienced a similar situation to the one you re trying to solve other people may be able to offer you a different perspective to solving your problem for example maybe you ve been obsessing over a way to maintain your fitness through a life change your challenge could be finding a way to schedule your morning run while still being able to take your new infant to daycare you might talk to another new parent or offer to take turns with childcare so you can work out you may feel that obsessing over something or someone has isolated you from friends and family re connect to friends family or co workers who you can explain your situation to talking can help you understand the underlying cause of your obsession and having a support network to turn to can reduce your stress for example if you re obsessing over an ex after a break up talk with a friend or family member talking with your friend might help you realize that you re obsessed because your ex was the first person to take you seriously in a relationship it s easy to slip into the routine of obsessing over something if you re not challenging yourself with new things if you ve been meaning to pursue a new hobby or take a class start doing it not only will you take your mind off of your obsession by focusing on a new task or skill you may also meet new people or learn something new about yourself new people and new ways of thinking can help you move beyond your obsession you might realize that you no longer crave whatever the obsession rewarded you with for example you might not obsess over a lost job opportunity if you learn a new trade that you actually enjoy more you might be so focused on obsessing over something going on in your life that you completely overlook the lives of your friends family members or people in your community reach out to people who might need your help not only will they appreciate it but you ll realize there s more to life than your obsession for example you might tutor at a school serve at a soup kitchen or drive an elderly relative to the grocery store if you re obsessed with something like playing video games or watching tv begin to reduce the amount of time you spend doing it if you re obsessed with a person limit how often you contact the person cutting back on your obsession can help you become more independent and carefree for example if you re limiting contact with a person remember to include social media time when cutting back on contact avoid texting messaging sending photos or calling often when you re busy it s easy to forget about what s bothering you preoccupy your mind so that you don t obsess in addition to trying new things you can also catch up on tasks you ve been meaning to do staying in touch with your support network and taking time to focus on your needs you might find that much of your time had previously been spent obsessing think about things you ve put on hold and finally do them for example you could get a haircut or meet up for a drink with friends who you ve been putting off for a while it s easy to make your obsession someone else s problem but instead of worrying over something that you believe to be someone else s fault just own up to it taking responsibility will help you control your mindset only you have control over your thoughts and you can stop obsessing for example if a colleague got a promotion you were up for don t blame the colleague and obsess over it instead take responsibility for the fact that your colleague was more qualified than you if you obsess over something regardless of whether it s a drug video games or a person chances are your friends enable you to obsess to stop obsessing you should be in an environment where you don t feel like obsessing and the people around you don t bring it up you might want to spend your free time in a different hang out spot and be around people that don t enable you even if this means taking a break from certain friends are all of your friends part of this culture then you may have to rely on family take this as an opportunity to renew your relationships with those you ve fallen away from recently you could rediscover people that you ve been missing in your life obsessing over something or someone is stressful take a break from the anxiety and do something you find relaxing you might soak in a bubble bath practice deep breathing or have a glass of wine while you read a book the point is to do something you enjoy that also calms you if you re having trouble with obsessive thoughts while you relax consider playing a recording of guided imagery or listen to an anxiety relief script

warning you can pay attention to your cat s body language to help read the meowing pay attention to how your cat reacts to you when it is meowing does it arch its back and rub up against you does it

as food or attention longer drawn out meows especially if they re throatier in nature tend to indicate your cat is annoyed or stressed by something a long and very drawn out moaning noise is almost always an indication of distress if you hear your cat yowling you should check in on it to make sure it s okay the frequency of meowing can also indicate what your cat is communicating many meows fired off in quick succession usually indicate your cat is trying to get your attention you can tell a lot about a cat s meow by tuning into tone you may hear purring or rumbling noises alongside a meow this usually indicate a happy meow squeaky meows or meows that sound like chirps usually indicate your cat is happy to see you in rare occasions purring can actually indicate distress focus on your cat s body language when it purrs if your cat seems tense and is keeping its ears back it may be purring out of distress if a cat clicks its teeth when meowing making a kind of chattering sound this is usually an indication of predatory excitement a cat may chatter when looking at a bird outside or stalking a small bug in your home a chatter can also indicate distress if your cat is chattering out the window for example it may be frustrated it cannot get at a bird or other prey cats often meow if they re injured or in pain long shrill yowling meows may indicate something wrong very loud meows can also be an indication of stress or pain excessive yowling with no identifiable cause should be evaluated by a vet meowing should never be entirely ignored you do not want to encourage excessive meowing but you should always check to make sure your cat does not need anything if you hear it meowing a cat may for example be trapped in a room or be unable to reach its litter boxes you should make sure your cat is not in need when you hear it meowing never scold hit or punish a cat in any way for meowing if you want your cat to not meow for breakfast in the morning ignore the behavior instead of punishing it cats do not respond well to punishment a cat is unlikely to realize why it is being punished and will only become stressed if you punish your cat for meowing it can create a stressful environment that can lead to other behavioral problems your cat may start meowing excessively suddenly in this case take it to a vet immediately unexplained meowing can often be a sign your cat is injured or sick you should never ignore unusual meowing in a cat that s normally quiet if you re dealing with a new cat you may be confused by excessive meowing if the meowing does not sound distressed or frightened it is probably okay certain cats are simply more vocal than others your new cat may simply feel the need to communicate through meowing more frequently

wires across your land you may create an easement to allow a neighbor to drive across your land to reach theirs or you may create an easement to allow a neighbor to park somewhere on your land easements are created in a variety of ways and they are most often recorded in an applicable registry of deeds which is where interests in real property are recorded when you no longer have use for the easement there are a number of ways that you can terminate it choose the method that best suits your needs and follow the directions in order to adequately terminate your easement terminating an easement through expiration terminating an easement through release terminating an easement through abandonment or prescription terminating an easement through merger assess the current easement notify the other party record your easement s termination speak with the other party obtain your agreement in writing stop using the easement or block use of the easement act in a way that shows you are trying to terminate the easement negotiate with the other party purchase all other parcels of land that are involved in the easement if your easement includes a provision stating that it will be terminated on a certain date or at the occurrence of a certain event then your easement will terminate when that date comes or when that event occurs look through your easement documents for one of these provisions and understand how the provisions works for example your easement might state this easement will terminate on june 5 2015 if this provision exists your easement will cease to exist on june 5 2015 in order to be effective this date must be certain and explicit and should not be open ended e g this easement will terminate sometime in the next five years your easement might also state this easement will terminate when party y no longer needs to use the access road to haul lumber from their property in this situation your easement will terminate when party y no longer uses the access road to haul lumber once you have identified and understand your easement s termination provision you should notify the other landowner of its termination this is important as they may think your easement is still effective and may continue to use it while you are not obligated to notify the other party to the easement in this situation it will make your termination process smoother and more beneficial to both parties of the easement also notifying the other landowner will give you an opportunity to discuss the termination provision and will allow you to agree on the easement s termination in some instances you or the other party may want to extend the life of an easement and notifying the other party will allow you to have this conversation if this is the case negotiate with the other party and come to an acceptable agreement once you and the other party are in agreement that you are going to terminate the easement by expiration get this agreement in writing and

record documents quickly and accurately because of the importance of recording you should consult an experienced real estate attorney whenever you are going to record something he or she will be able to help you through the process and will ensure you accomplish the goals you set out to accomplish an easement is terminated by release when the dominant estate landowner that is benefited by the easement the one using the easement grants a release of its easement rights to the servient estate landowner that is burdened by the easement the one allowing someone else to use their land if you are interested in terminating an easement through a release and you are the dominant estate holder begin by contacting the servient estate holder and telling them you are going to release your easement rights in this situation the other party has no say in what happens because you are simply stating that you are no longer going to enforce or use the easement if you are interested in terminating an easement through a release and you are the servient estate holder you will have to ask the other party to release their rights under the easement here you may have an opportunity to negotiate a deal but may have to provide something of value in order to have the other party release their rights for example you may have to provide financial compensation or maybe another easement in order for the other party to agree to release their rights under the easement however it is not unheard of for another party to simply agree to release their rights particularly if they do not use the easement a lot and if it does not burden them to release their rights once you agree to a release the termination agreement must be in writing also in the event there are multiple dominant estate holders e g a parcel of land is owned by three separate individuals every dominant estate holder must agree to the release when you draft this document be sure you clearly identify the properties involved the rights being released and all the parties to the agreement once you and the other party are in agreement that you are going to terminate the easement by by release get this agreement in writing and

to help you through the process and will ensure you accomplish the goals you set out to accomplish depending on whether you are the dominant estate holder or the servient estate holder you will have the option to terminate an easement by either abandonment or prescription depending on which party you are the first step in terminating an easement in these manners is to either stop using the easement or to block use of the easement if you are the dominant estate holder you can terminate an easement through abandonment the first step in terminating an easement through abandonment is to cease to use the easement at all this means you cannot do what it is the easement allows you to do for example if you have an easement that allows you to drive over someone s land to get to your own and you want to terminate the easement through abandonment you must cease to drive across the other person s land in order to get to your own if you are the servient estate holder you can terminate an easement through prescription the first step in terminating an easement through prescription is to block the other party s use of the easement for example if you have allowed another landowner to drive across your driveway in order to get to their land you could put up a fence across your driveway and not allow the other party to get through once you have either stopped using the easement or blocked the use of an easement depending on which party you are you will have to either show an intent to relinquish your easement rights or you will have to block the other party s use of the easement in an open manner if you do this the easement will be terminated if you are the dominant estate holder while you are not using the easement you must also show some intent to relinquish your rights under the easement for example apart from not using the easement you may also tell the other land owner that you do not need the easement anymore if you are the servient estate holder apart from blocking the other party s use of the easement you must also do so openly this means you must block use in an obvious way so that if the other land owner were to inspect the land he or she would notice and become aware of your blocking for example putting a locked fence in front of your driveway is likely considered open however putting a small log that can easily be removed in front of your driveway may not meet this requirement once you fulfill the requirements of terminating an easement by abandonment or prescription record an easement termination document with the applicable registry of deeds because a lot of easements are recorded interests in real property if you do not record its termination the easement may still appear on a title search and may affect the land s value and

of recording you should consult an experienced real estate attorney whenever you are going to record something he or she will be able to help you through the process and will ensure you accomplish the goals you set out to accomplish when an easement is terminated by a merger the dominant and servient estates come under common ownership this is the case because an owner cannot have an easement over his or her own land in order to start this process contact the other parties involved and negotiate with them to purchase their land terminating an easement in this manner is uncommon unless you or the other landowners were already planning on selling their land it is uncommon because you would normally not purchase a parcel of land simply to terminate an easement as you can see form the other methods there are other ways to terminate an easement that do not involve such a drastic input of money and or stress if all parties agree that having you purchase all the other parcels of land is in the best interest of everyone you will want to go through the process of purchasing their real estate the process of purchasing real estate includes making an offer and writing up a contract you will first need to make an acceptable offer to all other interested land owners and get your agreement to purchase their land in writing the contract will be legally binding although there are usually contingencies allowing you to back out in case some of the other steps do not go as planned disclosure review after you have signed the contract the seller s will provide you with a disclosure statement which is a document that discloses any number of things including flaws with the property and a preliminary title report if you see something in your review concerns you you may be able to back out of the deal inspections as part of the real estate contract you usually have the right to inspect the home for yourself to make sure everything looks good closing finally after you have done all of your due diligence you will sign your closing papers pay for the property and the process will be complete once you or the other party hold title to both parcels of land record your real estate purchase as well as an easement termination document with the applicable registry of deeds because a lot of easements are recorded interests in real property if you do not record its termination the

query	27	prepare and cook prawns despite a few anatomical differences prawn are virtually interchangeable with shrimp in any recipe prawns can be prepared and cooked using a variety of methods and many people don t even clean them before cooking claiming it leads to better flavor cleaning and preparing whole prawns pan frying prawns boiling prawns grilling prawns remove the shells and heads to make eating prawns easier after cooking remove the heads by pulling and twisting pull off the legs peel off the shell with your thumbs use a small knife to create a slit down the back of the prawn remove the vein from the prawn rinse under running water and pat dry with paper towels melt 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter or olive oil in a skillet over medium high heat add any flavors or aromatics add a single layer of shelled prawns and cook until the underside turns pink add seasoning and stir the prawns up once as they cook flip the prawns and cook until the entire outside is pink boil enough water to just cover the prawns add the prawns and lower the heat plunge prawns into a bowl of ice water to stop cooking serve the prawns chilled preheat your grill at high heat try out a baking soda bath for the crispiest prawns if you like crispy well browned prawns soak the prawns in 1 tablespoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of baking soda and 1 cup water for 15 minutes before moving on skewer the prawns coat the prawns in olive oil arrange the skewers on the grill without touching each other cook for 3 4 minutes on each side turning when the side is pink season the prawns after the come off the grill you can cook the prawns in their shells as well removing them later and this often helps them retain moisture as they cook but if the prawns are part of a larger dish like a soup you don t want to search for scales with your spoon luckily cleaning prawns is easy before cooking if you are grilling or pan frying your prawns you should leave at least the shells on you can leave the heads on the prawns as they will lead to a stronger flavor but many people remove them to make eating easier they should come off with ease grab around the eyes and firmly twist to pull the head off you can discard these or save them to make seafood stock simply use your hand to pinch off the small dangling legs and pull them away starting at the larger end work your thumb under the shell and slide it down to the tail pulling off the shell as you go it may come off in pieces you can either leave the tail on usually as a handle when eating by hand or remove and discard it if you re cooking the prawns into another dish you re looking for the long black vein that runs through the entire prawn it is easiest to see near the tail where there is a small valley in the prawn pull the end of the vein up with the tip of the knife then grab it with your fingers to pull it off this is not strictly necessary but the vein has a bitter taste that is best removed now you can still remove the vein while leaving the shell on to do so clip the shell with scissors and pull the vein out closing the shell back up you can also pull the entire vein out in one piece if you break the head off and locate it moisture on the outside of the prawn will make the cook unevenly give them a quick rinse with cold water and then dry them off if you don t plan on cooking them yet keep the prawns on ice or in the refrigerator if cooking a lot of prawns add enough butter to cover the bottom you should have enough oil to cover the bottom of the skillet but you don t need the prawns to be covered aromatics are basically spices that cook with the oil imparting their flavor on the prawns some good additions are 1 2 cup chopped shallots 3 5 cloves of garlic smashed 1 2 tablespoons chopped ginger this usually takes 3 4 minutes as the first side cooks stir in your flavorings make sure you stir enough to coat the outside of the prawns in your seasonings then leave them until the first side is cooked some seasoning options include mexican prawns salt lime juice red pepper cayenne chili powder garlic powder if not using fresh mediterranean prawns salt lemon juice black pepper oregano garlic powder if not using fresh cook in olive oil cajun prawns salt paprika cayenne thyme red and black pepper chili powder onion garlic powder if not using fresh cook in butter prawns lose their moisture quickly so you just want to get the outsides nice and pink and then turn off the heat there will be deep streaks of pink not just white when they are done serve in the hot pan so that they don t cool too quickly add half of a lemon sliced or cut in chunks 1 2 teaspoons old bay seasoning 1 minced garlic clove and 1 teaspoon of salt let this mixture boil for 1 minute before adding the prawns leave the tails on and make sure they are covered in water simmer for approximately 3 minutes or until the prawns turn pink remove from heat you can leave the shells and head on or remove them before cooking leaving them on will lead to a stronger flavor as soon as they come off drain the hot water and plunge the prawns in a cold water keep them from cooking you can use that water as the base of a soup stock if you want to save it these prawns are a nice addition to a buffet table often placed on a large platter and served with a variety of sauces such as cocktail sauce tartar sauce or drawn butter these prawns also work well in a prawn salad with a mayonnaise based dressing either served on a bed of greens or in a bread roll prawns need to be cooked quickly to retain their moisture and still cook all the way through so you want good high heat this leads to wonderfully browned crispy skins with succulent prawn meat underneath generally leaving the skins and tails on his best for grilling however it is not essential the baking soda alters the ph slightly promoting caramelization pat the prawns dry after removing them but don t rinse them and get rid of the baking soda you can mix them with vegetables as well threading them one after the other on your skewer whatever you do thread them tightly together with no spaces between each prawns this helps the interiors retain moisture as the outsides brown soak wooden skewers in water until thoroughly soaked through soaking the wooden skewers ahead of time prevents them from drawing moisture out of your prawns while they cook use a brush to coat all the sides of prawns with olive oil which helps them cook evenly add a dusting of garlic powder if you love garlic and a light sprinkling of salt press them lightly down into the grill so that the prawns are touching the hot grate remember that prawns cook quickly and you only need the outsides to be pink to move on with a very hot grill you should get char lines quickly and then the prawns are ready to turn cook for 1 2 minutes on the opposite side before removing take the prawns shells and tails still intact and toss them with some olive oil or melted butter salt and pepper you can then add whatever other flavors you desire mexican prawns lime juice red pepper cayenne chipotle chili powder garlic powder mediterranean prawns lemon juice black pepper oregano garlic powder

speak any other languages are they interested in any particular languages or is there an inside joke between you two involving another country that might be fun to reference if you just finished watching a television series about patagonia for example learn how to say i love you in mapuche mapudungun or in spanish with a chilean accent use google translate to practice your pronunciation listen to the words and repeat them aloud at a normal volume say the words to someone as practice and get their feedback say the words to yourself in a mirror say the whole sentence that you plan on saying try saying the sentence aloud until you are comfortable overemphasize the words or say them in a funny ways after you tell the person you love them you can be silly and playful and keep telling them the words over and over again you can always show him her the note and explain what it is about the person that makes you feel that way seeing that you cared enough about them to made a special note will make them feel loved a text message is a great way to communicate your affection without having to worry about saying the word correctly getting a thoughtful text message will make that person feel especially loved and special this can be a more intimate way of communicating your feelings for someone find a situation where you can bring up the word it can be on a walk that you take or during a pause in conversation during dinner don t worry too much about saying it perfectly it is unlikely that your loved one will know the correct pronunciation also it is the thought that counts when you are saying i love you 
query	31	calculate the volume of a square pyramid a square pyramid is a three dimensional solid characterized by a square base and sloping triangular sides that meet at a single point above the base if s displaystyle s represents the length of one of the square base s sides and h displaystyle h represents the height of the pyramid the perpendicular distance from the the base to the point the volume of a square pyramid can be calculated with the formula v 1 3 s 2 h displaystyle v frac 1 3 s 2 h it doesn t matter whether the pyramid is the size of a paperweight or larger than the great pyramid of giza this formula works for any square pyramid the volume can also be calculated using what is called the slant height of the pyramid finding volume using base area and height finding volume using slant height finding volume using the edge height measure the side length of the base calculate the area of the base multiply the area of the base by the pyramid s height divide this answer by 3 measure the pyramid s slant height imagine a right triangle assign variables to the values use the pythagorean theorem to calculate the perpendicular height use the height and base to calculate volume measure the pyramid s edge height assign variables calculate the diagonal of the square base find the side of the base from the diagonal use the side and height to calculate volume since by definition square pyramids have bases that are perfectly square all of the sides of the base should be equal in length thus for a square pyramid you only need to find the length of one side consider a pyramid whose base is a square with side lengths of s 5cm displaystyle s 5 text cm this is the value you will use to find the area of the base if the sides of the base are not equal in length you have a rectangular pyramid rather than a square pyramid the volume formula for rectangular pyramids is very similar to the formula for square pyramids if l displaystyle l represents the length of the rectangular pyramid s base and w displaystyle w represents its width the pyramid s volume is v 13h l w displaystyle v frac 1 3 h l w finding the volume begins by finding the two dimensional area of the base this is done by multiplying the base s length times its width because the base of a square pyramid is a square its sides all have equal lengths so the area of the base is equal to the length of one side squared times itself in the example since the side lengths of the pyramid s base are all 5 cm you can find the base s area as area s2 5cm 2 25cm2 displaystyle text area s 2 5 text cm 2 25 text cm 2 remember that two dimensional areas are expressed in square units square centimeters square meters square miles and so on next multiply the base area by the height of the pyramid as a reminder the height is the distance of the line segment stretching from the apex of the pyramid to the plane of the base at perpendicular angles to both in the example suppose the pyramid has a height of 9 cm in this case multiply the area of the base by this value as follows 25cm2 9cm 225cm3 displaystyle 25 text cm 2 9 text cm 225 text cm 3 remember that volumes are expressed in cubic units in this case because all the linear measurements are centimeters the volume is in cubic centimeters finally find the volume of the pyramid by dividing the value you just found from multiplying the base area by the height by 3 this will give you a final answer that represents the volume of the square pyramid in the example divide 225 cm3 by 3 to get an answer of 75 cm3 for the volume sometimes you will not be told the perpendicular height of the pyramid instead you may be told or may have to measure the pyramid s slant height with the slant height you will be able to use the pythagorean theorem to calculate the perpendicular height a pyramid s slant height is the distance from its apex to the midpoint of one of the base sides measure to the midpoint of the side and not to one of the corners of the base for this example assume that you measure the slant height to be 13 cm and you are told that the side length is 10 cm as a reminder the pythagorean theorem can be expressed as the equation a2 b2 c2 displaystyle a 2 b 2 c 2 where a displaystyle a and b displaystyle b are the perpendicular legs of the right triangle and c displaystyle c is the hypotenuse to use the pythagorean theorem you need a right triangle imagine a right triangle slicing through the middle of the pyramid and perpendicular to the base of the pyramid the slant height of the pyramid called l displaystyle l is the hypotenuse of this right triangle the base of this right triangle is one half the length of s displaystyle s the side of the square base of the pyramid the pythagorean theorem uses the variables a b and c but it helps to replace those with variables that have meaning for your problem the slant height l displaystyle l takes the place of c displaystyle c in the pythagorean theorem the leg of the right triangle which is s2 displaystyle frac s 2 takes the place of b displaystyle b you will be solving for the height of the pyramid h displaystyle h which takes the place of a displaystyle a in the pythagorean theorem this substitution will look like this a2 b2 c2 displaystyle a 2 b 2 c 2 h2 s2 2 l2 displaystyle h 2 frac s 2 2 l 2 insert the measured values of s 10 displaystyle s 10 and l 13 displaystyle l 13 then proceed to solve the equation h2 l2 s2 2 displaystyle h 2 l 2 frac s 2 2 original equation h l2 s2 2 displaystyle h sqrt l 2 frac s 2 2 square root

displaystyle h sqrt 144 subtract h 12 displaystyle h 12 simplify square root after using the calculations with the pythagorean theorem you now have the information you need to calculate the volume of the pyramid as you normally would use the formula v 13s2h displaystyle v frac 1 3 s 2 h and solve making sure to label your answer in cubic units from the calculations the height of the pyramid is 12 cm use this and the base side of 10 cm to calculate the pyramid s volume v 13s2h displaystyle v frac 1 3 s 2 h v 13 102 12 displaystyle v frac 1 3 10 2 12 v 13 100 12 displaystyle v frac 1 3 100 12 v 400cm3 displaystyle v 400 text cm 3 the edge height is the length of the edge of the pyramid measured from the apex to one of the corners of the pyramid s base as before you will then use the pythagorean theorem to calculate the perpendicular height of the pyramid for this example assume that the edge height can be measured to be 11 cm and you are given that the perpendicular height is 5 cm as before you need a right triangle to use the pythagorean theorem in this case however your unknown value is the base of the pyramid you know the perpendicular height and the edge height if you imagine cutting the pyramid diagonally from one corner to the opposite corner and opening it up the exposed inside face is a triangle the height of that triangle is the perpendicular height of the pyramid it divides the exposed triangle into two symmetrical right triangles the hypotenuse of either right triangle is the edge height of the pyramid the base of either right triangle is one half the diagonal of the base of the pyramid use this imaginary right triangle and assign values to the pythagorean theorem you know the perpendicular height h displaystyle h which is one leg of the pythagorean theorem a displaystyle a the edge height of the pyramid l displaystyle l is the hypotenuse of this imaginary right triangle so it takes the place of c displaystyle c the unknown diagonal of the base of the pyramid is the remaining leg of the right triangle b displaystyle b after you make these substitutions the equation will look like this a2 b2 c2 displaystyle a 2 b 2 c 2 h2 b2 l2 displaystyle h 2 b 2 l 2 you will need to rearrange the equation to isolate the variable b displaystyle b and then solve for its value h2 b2 l2 displaystyle h 2 b 2 l 2 revised equation b2 l2 h2 displaystyle b 2 l 2 h 2 substitute h2 from both sides b l2 h2 displaystyle b sqrt l 2 h 2 square root both sides b 112 52 displaystyle b sqrt 11 2 5 2 insert numerical values b 121 25 displaystyle b sqrt 121 25 simplify squares b 96 displaystyle b sqrt 96 subtract values b 9 80 displaystyle b 9 80 simplify square root double this value to find the diagonal of the square base of the pyramid thus the diagonal of the pyramid s base is 9 8 2 19 6 cm the base of the pyramid is a square the diagonal of any square is equal to the length of a side times the square root of 2 conversely you can find the side of the square from its diagonal by dividing by the square root of 2 for this sample pyramid the diagonal has been calculated to be 19 6 cm therefore the side is equal to s 19 62 19 61 41 13

query	32	perform a s ance a s ance is an event during which the living seek to get in touch with members of the spirit world typically a group of people gather to create a welcoming atmosphere and invite spirits to answer questions or deliver messages from those who have passed away the only rule for conducting a s ance is that everyone present should believe that it s possible to communicate with the other side while communicating with spirits can be frightening since we tend to fear what we cannot fully understand most people who experience a successful s ance are left with a sense of wonder and appreciation for the world beyond what we can see or touch creating a spirit friendly atmosphere welcoming the spirits ending the s ance invite people who believe in the spirit world ask the sitters to prepare questions consider having a medium conduct the s ance choose a quiet room to use set a table with candles consider using equipment to make contact with spirits begin the s ance near midnight have everyone hush and turn off their electronic devices be seated in a circle and light the candles summon the spirits to join you ask questions and be patient decipher the spirits answers continue the s ance as long as you re still receiving answers thank the spirits for coming when you re ready to stop turn on the lights and process what happened this way the ghost spirits will be more comfortable with wining and dining with people who believe a s ance is much more powerful if everyone there really believes that it s possible to communicate with spirits if even just one person is skeptical or thinks the whole thing is silly the power of the s ance will be weakened a s ance is built upon the collective positive energy of the participants called sitters so make sure everyone you invite is truly on board to have a supernatural experience you might want to invite people who have lost someone they want to get in touch with a s ance is an opportunity to communicate with loved ones on the other side don t invite someone who s deeply afraid of ghosts or who tends to get nervous when something out of the ordinary happens this could be disruptive to the s ance having questions in mind to engage the spirits will give the s ance more structure rather than just asking the spirits to come and make their presence known people can try to summon the spirits of specific people and receive information that would be impossible to get in any other way for example someone who lost her grandmother could plan to summon her grandmother s spirit and ask if she s ok bear in mind that people should not have the expectation of receiving a clear straightforward answer to their questions the spirits do not communicate the same way that humans communicate with each other yes or no questions usually produce more satisfying results than questions that would require a long winded answer if there s someone in the group who has had experience conducing a s ance or who is more psychically gifted than the others in the group he or she might be the right one to mediate the s ance a medium opens the s ance with a prayer invites the spirits to join the circle and asks the spirits questions having a medium isn t a requirement but it can be useful to have an experienced person lead the group especially if there are first timers among the group if you want to conduct a s ance but you don t know anyone you d want to nominate to be the medium you can actually hire a professional medium to facilitate the experience if you choose to do this be sure to look into the person s credentials and make sure the price is reasonable it s important to conduct the s ance in a place where there will be as few interruptions as possible choose a space that s quiet with lighting you can adjust to a dim setting make sure the room is comfortable and not filled with distracting electronics loud artwork or other items that might take away from the experience many people mistakenly think that a s ance must be conducted in a haunted place the room or building you choose does not have to be haunted spirits will come to any place if they feel welcome when you call them you may however wish to hold the s ance in a place that holds spiritual meaning for you and the others who will be present for example you could hold it in the home of a loved one who has passed on if you seek to connect with that person through the s ance the typical seating arrangement in a s ance is circular so it s best to set a round table although this isn t mandatory cover the table with a tablecloth and set out several candles using candles instead of electric lighting will help create a spiritual atmosphere arrange straight backed chairs around the table for your guests if you feel it will help to enhance the mood you can also use incense and instrumental music to create a spiritual setting if you wish to sit in a circle but don t have a round table arrange comfortable cushions in a circle on the floor and set the cloth and candles in the middle of the circle all you really need to conduct a s ance is the presence of willing sitters but some people like to use special equipment that can make it a little easier to communicate with the spirits spirits frequently communicate through objects so you may want to have an array of options on the table for example you could use a ouija board to help you ask questions and have the answers spelled out even an item as simple as a glass of water can be used as a tool for communication you could ask a spirit to alert you to its presence by disturbing the water recording the session could add another layer of communication recordings often pick up sounds or images that aren t heard or seen by the people present consider setting up a video camera or tape player to record what happens this is not absolutely necessary but the time between 11 30 and 12 30 seems to have special significance in the spirit world in the physical world there are fewer interruptions at this time of day and it s easier to get in the right frame of mind to be open to supernatural possibilities this will help everyone get in the right state of mind to experience the s ance make sure everyone has used the restroom checked their phones and so on before the beginning of the s ance once the session is underway any type of distraction could throw off the energy and prematurely end the s ance at this time you might want to ask your sitters if they re ready to participate in the s ance get a feel for people s moods it s normal for people to seem a little anxious you might see someone giggle nervously or look a little worried however if anyone seems to be acting cynical about the event or if anyone looks frightened before it even starts you might want to ask that person to sit this one out have everyone sit down and patiently wait while you light the candles in the center of the table make sure electric lighting has been turned off or dimmed light incense and turn on instrumental music if you wish once everything is ready assess the environment and make adjustments if necessary to create just the right atmosphere there s no set script for beginning a s ance but many people choose to recite a prayer of welcome to set the tone for the event you or the medium if it s a different person should thank everyone for coming and announce that it s time for the s ance to begin ask everyone to please join hands and close their eyes then recite the prayer and ask the spirits to join you some people pray for protection from angry or evil spirits and ask that only well intentioned spirits join the circle you may summon specific spirits by name during this time for example you could say grandmother margaret we gather here tonight in hope that we ll receive a sign of your presence please feel welcome in our circle and join us when you re ready either the medium should ask all of the questions or sitters can take turns asking in any case ask one question at a time and pause for several minutes to wait for an answer be sure everyone stays quiet since the presence of a spirit be difficult to notice remember that yes or no questions are more likely to solicit satisfying answers questions like are you with us and do you have a message for us are better than what is it like to live in the spirit world make sure no one breaks the circle while the questions are being asked if someone gets up and leaves or becomes distracted in some way the spiritual energy will be lost in very rare cases a spirit will communicate by having someone in the group translate a message the medium or another person who s psychically open might begin addressing the group with words the spirit has given him or her most of the time however the answers are more subtle than this and the meanings are more difficult to interpret pay attention to what s physically happening in the room if a glass of water gets knocked over a candle begins flickering wildly even though there s no draft or a door inexplicably shuts these may all be signs that a spirit is present listen for sounds that are out of the ordinary and have no explainable source it can help to ask the spirit to answer a yes or no question by giving the group a sign for example you could say if you re the spirit of my grandmother or you have a message from her make some water spill out of the cup a s ance can last anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour or longer try to keep everyone in the circle until the spirits seem to be gone and you re no longer receiving answers to your questions the ending of a s ance usually occurs naturally when the spiritual energy in the room eventually dissolves a s ance can be an emotionally intense experience that elicits a range of different reactions if someone in your group begins to cry inconsolably scream or otherwise exhibit extreme negativity or fear either have someone escort that person to a room that s less spiritually charge or go ahead and turn on the lights to end the s ance it s always a good idea to give a s ance closure as you would any other type of spiritual service or ritual end the s ance by thanking the spirits for joining your circle you may want to say a prayer of closure thank the sitters for their participation as well then blow out the candles to formally end the session allow people a few moments to quietly pull themselves out of the spiritual realm and back into the physical present moment talk about the events that occurred during the s ance to find out what everyone can learn from the experience analyze the signs and answers you received from the spirits when that door slammed shut could it have been caused by a draft or are you all absolutely certain that a spirit was responsible if you recorded the s ance watch and listen to the session turn up the volume and listen for voices and sounds that no one noticed during the s ance 
query	33	dance corridos corridos are an important part of latin american folk dance a corridos play refers to a type of musical ballad while corridos as a dance refers to the dance usually performed during these ballads the steps are a little complex but once you get them down the dance can be very invigorating the first portion of the song the middle portion of the song the final portion of the song grab your partner and get into your starting position take ten step closes switch to eight grapevine steps stamp your feet go back to step closes move into the soldado return to the grapevine steps go into step closes enter into the pas de basques repeat enter into another soldado do a series of grapevine steps with female turns proceed with step closes go into a few grapevine steps resume your step closes perform the soldado join hands and finish up with grapevine steps release start the dance by assuming standard ballroom position the man s back should face the center of the dance floor and the woman should face both the man and the dance floor note that couples dancing corridos formally will form a double circle around the ballroom and move counter clockwise the man and woman should face each other with their bodies slightly touch the right half of the man s front should come in contact with the right half of the woman s front starting at the upper thighs and extending up through the middle of the torso the man should take the woman s right hand with his left the two palms should clasp and the fingers and thumbs of the man s hand should close around the woman s hand the man should place his right hand on the woman s back right at the base of the shoulder blade this hand should be loosely cupped with the fingers and thumb together the woman should keep her left hand and left forearm on the man s right arm during the first five measures the man should take ten step closes to the right moving clockwise the woman will follow with ten simultaneous step closes to the left these first five measures take place during the introduction of the song to perform a step close the man steps on his right foot during the first count he closes his feet then steps his left foot beside the right during the second count for measures 6 through 13 the man will make eight grapevine steps to the left moving counter clockwise and the woman will match his steps by moving to the right to perform a grapevine step the man crosses his right foot in front of the left stepping down on it during the first count he steps sideways and to the left with his left foot during the second count during the third count he crosses his right foot behind his left and steps down on it for the final and fourth count he steps sidewards to the left using his left foot the man should stamp his left foot for a count of two then swiftly close his feet and stamp the right foot next to the left on the third count of the measure by the fourth count the right foot should be freed again for movement the woman will also stamp her feet but her movements should mirror the man s as a result she will stamp her right foot on a two count stamp her left next to her right on the third count then free her left foot for measures 14 and 15 the man makes four step closes to the right moving clockwise again the woman makes four step closes to the left this portion of the dance usually takes place during a brief musical interlude of the song this portion of the dance is a little complex and involves a series of slides or shuffles as usual the woman s movements should mirror the man s when he moves right she moves left and vice versa during measure 16 the man shuffles or slides four steps diagonally back and to the left these steps start with his right foot and alternate back and fourth between the right and left foot during measure 17 the man makes another four shuffles or slides this time moving diagonally forward and to the left once more he starts with his right foot and alternatives between the right and left the above two steps are repeated as a pattern three more times over six more measures during the last measure the man stamps twice with his left foot for a count of two quickly closes his feet together and stamps his right foot next to the left by the third count the right foot is once more freed by the fourth count the first part of the dance is completed with the man taking another eight grapevine steps to the left then performing the left left right free stamping pattern that followed the initial set of grapevine steps earlier in the dance the woman continues to mirror these steps as with the first part of the dance the second part opens with ten step closes the man moves sideways to the right and the woman moves to her left at the conclusion of these step closes the two partners release hands and break apart the man clasps his hands behind his back and the woman uses hers to hold her skirt out to the side during this second part of the dance the measure count resets as such these first step closes for this portion are to measures one through five also note that each portion of the dance has the same number of measures 31 this part of the dance has its own complexities as well and must be broken down into substeps the full movement set takes place over a series of two measures though the woman s moves mirror the man s moves but the woman does not turn here even though the man does the man should cross his right foot in front of the left upon stepping back down onto the right foot he must rock on it gently while simultaneously raising the left foot off the floor this happens during the first count during the second count the man must set his left foot down and rock on it in place on count three the man closes his feet together and draws his right foot next to the left the above three steps are repeated for counts four five and six but the movements are in reverse in other words his left foot crosses over the right his right foot rocks in place and his left foot draws back to the right immediately after the man must walk two steps forward right foot left foot and turn to his left in a full circle this takes place over the final two counts the steps for the pas de basques and the final turn must be repeated three more times during the final measure however the man must stamp twice with his left foot close his feet and stamp the right foot next to the left then free his right foot again both partners must take four step closes during the next four measures the man moves to his right and the woman moves to her left as with the first part of the dance the couple enters into another soldado this one follows the same steps and moves of the one performed during the first part of the dance the man makes four shuffling steps diagonally back and to the left followed by four shuffling steps diagonally forward and to the left this pattern is repeated three more times at the final measure the standard left left right free stamping pattern is performed at the conclusion of this soldado the man must face his partner both partners must have their elbows bent the man s right hand joins the woman s left hand at shoulder height and the man s left hand must also be behind the woman s back roughly at the base of her shoulder blade the woman s right hand should continue to hold her skirt for the remaining eight measures both the man and the woman should perform grapevine steps the man should move sidewards to the left and the woman should move sideward right every other measure the woman should turn clockwise twice instead of performing grapevine steps as she turns she should move under their joined hands and take four walking steps these steps start with the right foot and alternate between right and left the final part of the dance starts in the same way the first part began the man takes ten step closes to the right with the woman mirroring by moving to her left note that this final part of the dance is almost identical to the first part the only difference comes in during the final set of grapevine steps the man must make eight grapevine steps to the left while the woman steps to the right do this eight times at the end of the last step the man stamps on his left foot for a count of two closes his feet then stamps his right foot back to its place beside the left on the third count for the fourth count the right foot is freed again the woman mirrors these steps with her opposite feet perform four step closes to the right if you have the man s role for the woman s role perform four mirroring step closes to the left this soldado is exactly the same as it was during the first part of the dance as usual the woman mirrors the man s movements with her opposite foot the man should take four sliding steps diagonally back and to the left starting with his right foot afterward he should take four sliding steps diagonally forward and to the left starting with his right foot again this movement should be repeated three more times during the final four count the man should stomp with his left foot twice on count his right foot should should stomp next to the left on the third count by the fourth count his right foot should be freed up to move again for the final measures of the dance the partners should perform eight grapevine steps and conclude with another left left right free foot stomping step note that during this part of the dance the couples should have their inside hands joined instead of being poised in the ballroom position in other words the man s right hand should join with the woman s left while the woman holds up her skirt with her right hand and the man holds the back of the woman with his left hand at the conclusion of the last set of steps the song should end and the dance will be over you and your partner can break apart and leave the dance floor at the end of the dance both partners should thank each other leave the floor as quickly and gracefully as possible at the conclusion of the dance the man should lead the woman off the dance floor by offering her his arm and escorting her back to her seat

stick to your plan for an extended period of time depending on exactly how much weight you need to lose should plan on sticking to your weight loss plan for about 6 12 months or maybe even longer come up with a diet and exercise plan and ways to keep yourself motivated so you can lose a large quantity of weight setting a weight loss goal designing a weight loss diet using exercise to support weight loss staying motivated figure out how much weight you should lose plan for slow gradual weight loss set a specific goal talk to your doctor set up a consult with a registered dietitian manage calories follow a high protein diet eat moderate amounts of carbohydrate rich foods fill up on fruits and vegetables use water to manage appetite start increasing lifestyle activity include low impact cardio exercises begin strength training speak to a personal trainer create a vision board monitor your progress find a support group start a weight loss journal if you feel you have a large quantity of weight to lose it will be a good idea to figure out how overweight you are and how much weight you should lose to be in a healthy range there are two methods to figuring out how much weight you should lose bmi or body mass index and ideal body weight both are equations easily found online that can give you an idea of exactly how much weight you need to lose there are a few different bmi categories if your bmi falls into the range of 25 24 9 you re considered over weight and typically have 40 60 pounds of excess weight if you re bmi falls into the range of 30 34 9 you re considered obese and have 60 80 pounds of excess weight if you re bmi is over 35 0 you re considered morbidly obese and have over 80 pounds of excess weight to lose also figure out your ideal body weight this is dependent on your height and gender subtract your ideal body weight from your current weight to get an idea of how much excess weight you re carrying compare the amount of weight you need to lose from both equations you can average the two or choose one or the other to follow even if you have a lot of weight to lose you don t want to try any risky diets or aim to lose your weight quickly slow gradual weight loss is safe and sustainable most health professionals only recommend losing about 1 2 pounds a week although slow this rate of weight loss is sustainable and you ll be able to have an easier time maintaining this weight loss long term take your desired weight loss goal or total excess weight and figure out how many weeks it ll take you to lose that amount of weight for example if you want to lose 50 pounds and are aiming to lose 2 pounds per week it ll take you roughly 25 weeks or about 6 months you may lose weight quicker the first few months of your diet this is normal when you have larger quantities of weight to lose however this shouldn t be your target weight loss rate long term knowing how much weight you need to lose and about the time you ll need to give yourself to lose it will help you define specific goals for yourself realistic and well planned weight loss goals can keep you focused and motivated this is especially true if you ll be losing weight for a long time when setting your goals aim to be very specific and realistic that means following the guideline of losing 1 2 pounds per week maximum also note in your goals how you plan on losing the weight are you going to follow a specific diet plan are you going to create your own diet are you going to be exercising to help you lose weight also plan for some weeks where your weight loss may stall or you may have a few slip ups both weight plateaus and a week or two of falling off the band wagon are normal and expected plan for this in your goal timeline whenever you want to lose weight especially extreme amounts of weight it s very important to talk your doctor about the safety of your weight loss your doctor will be able to tell you whether or not weight loss is safe and appropriate for you generally if you have large quantities of weight to lose weight loss will be especially beneficial to your overall health also if you re overweight or obese you may have some chronic health conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes these conditions can complicate weight loss or make it more difficult you may also want to consider speaking to your doctor about appetite suppressant medications these are reserved for very overweight people and can only be prescribed by your physician seeing a dietitian may be extremely helpful if you re trying to lose a lot of weight these weight loss and nutrition professionals will be able to guide you along your weight loss journey ask your doctor or search online for a local dietitian that focuses in weight loss set up a consult to talk about your weight and desire to lose weight ask your dietitian to help prescribe a diet that will work for your personal lifestyle and abilities they may be able to provide you a calorie range meal plans and other suggestions to get you on a good weight loss track you can also meet with them weekly or monthly to keep yourself accountable with your weight loss diet if you re designing your own diet you ll need to come up with a calorie limit to help induce weight loss managing your calories is the backbone to your weight loss plan to stick to your safe plan of losing 1 2 pounds per week aim to cut out about 500 750 calories daily from your diet to figure out what a 500 calorie deficit looks like start by counting the amount of calories you consume on a typical day keep a food diary or track your calorie intake in a food journal app for a few days to get an average intake take your average caloric intake and subtract either 500 750 calories from this number this will give you an estimate of a calorie limit that will help you lose about 1 2 pounds per week unfortunately you can t keep cutting out calories to help you lose more weight it s never recommended to eat less than 1200 calories a day if you do you re weight loss will typically slow or stop and you re at risk for nutrient deficiencies because you re not eating enough if you subtract 500 or 750 calories from your typical day and get a number less than 1200 then you ll need to use 1200 calories daily as your minimum and target goal there are many studies that show the benefit of a higher protein diet and weight loss following this type of diet will be especially helpful if you re aiming to lose large quantities of weight protein works great for weight loss for a few reasons first it helps maintain your lean muscle mass and metabolism or your body s ability to burn calories it also helps you feel more satisfied at meals and keeps you satisfied longer after your meal is over when following a weight loss high protein diet choose lean sources of protein these foods are lower in calories and fat and will fit into a restricted calorie diet instead of trying to hit a certain amount of protein each day focus on having 1 2 servings of protein at each meal this takes the guess work out of a high protein diet each serving of protein should be 3 4 oz or about 1 2 cup try foods like seafood legumes low fat dairy lean beef eggs poultry and tofu in addition to following a higher protein diet consider eating fewer carbohydrates to help you lose weight like higher protein diets studies have also shown that lower carb diets result in quicker and easier weight loss compared to just low calorie diets although carbohydrates are found in many foods it s not realistic to cut out carbohydrates completely from your diet plus it doesn t leave you with a well balanced diet either limit carbohydrates from the grain group these foods do provide nutrients but these vitamins and minerals are present in many other foods as well if you do choose to have a grain like bread rice or pasta consider choosing only 100 whole grain foods these foods are high in fiber vitamins and minerals compared to refined grains like white bread or white rice also if you do choose to have a serving of grains stick to the appropriate portion size measure out 1 oz or 1 2 cup per serving when you re following a lower calorie diet its easy to think you re not eating a lot of food or you re not eating enough to fill you up eating 5 9 servings of fruits and vegetables can help prevent this both fruits and vegetables are low in calorie but very high in fiber vitamins minerals and antioxidants filling up half your plate with a fruit or a vegetable can help provide bulk and volume to your meals without going over your calorie limit in addition these high fiber foods can help make you feel more full with less and keep you feeling full longer after your meal has been over measure out your portions of your fruits and vegetables stick to 1 cup of dense vegetables 2 cups of leafy greens and 1 2 cup of fruit per serving in addition to foods you can use water to help you lose weight and stay satisfied on your diet although water alone doesn t cause weight loss it can definitely help stay adequate hydrated each day to help support your weight loss when you re dehydrated even a little bit you may have feelings of hunger instead of thirst this may cause you to eat or snack which can make weight loss more difficult to prevent dehydration drink adequate fluids each day aim for 8 13 glasses daily or so that you do not feel thirsty during the day if you have a lot of weight to lose adding in some activity to your day will help you reach your goal if you re not currently active or haven t been active in awhile consider starting your exercise routine by increasing your lifestyle activities these are exercises you do on a regular basis anything from walking around during the day taking the stairs or doing household chores can count as lifestyle activity some studies show that increased lifestyle activity throughout the day can have similar results in regards to weight loss as planned and structured activities like a 20 minute jog think about your current day and how active you are plan ways that you can move more and take more steps in the day to increase your lifestyle activity try parking farther away skipping the elevator and taking the stairs going for a walk on your lunch break or doing standing squats during commercial breaks in addition to lifestyle activity it s important to work on including planned aerobic or radio exercises these are the calorie burning exercises that have a significant effect on your weight if you have a significant amount of weight to lose medium to higher intensity exercises may be too difficult or uncomfortable to perform stick to low impact aerobic exercises until you feel more comfortable with higher impact exercises low impact exercises to try include water aerobics or water walking using the elliptical or recumbent bike the typical amount of activity recommended is about 2 1 2 hours a week if you re unable to do this amount initially thats ok pick an amount of time that you re able to do and start there slowly advance to increased time per session or increased frequency over the week as you re able another type of exercise to include is strength or resistance training unlike cardio these exercises help increase lean muscle mass and your metabolism if you re not currently active start your exercise plan with lifestyle activity and cardio once you re able to do these comfortably start incorporating strength training it may be too much to include all 3 types of activity at once however the benefits of strength training are great it can help increase your metabolism and help your body burn more calories at rest aim for 1 2 days of strength training each week you only have to do about 20 minutes and work every major muscle group something

estates you should start by asking people you know oftentimes the people you know will have set up trusts themselves or know people that have done so if you have hired an attorney in the past even one in a different discipline ask that attorney for a referral ask your parents who helped them set up their estate discuss attorney options with friends you trust if they know any attorneys ask them questions about their experience with the attorney they are recommending was the attorney attentive and respectful did the attorney complete the task diligently and ethically if your friends and family cannot offer you much help contact your state bar association in california for example the state bar website offers three types of services to help you find a qualified attorney first you have the option of typing in a lawyer s name or bar number this is a great resource if you have already gotten referrals and you want to check their background expertise and history of discipline second

of their attorneys if you use these resources you ill have a great chance to find someone who not only specializes in trusts and estates but also someone who is well respected in the field for example one such organization is the american college of trust and estate counsel if you go to their website their homepage offers a link to help you find one of their attorneys it will allow you to search by state and it will provide you with the name and contact information of all of their members the internet can be a great resource for gathering information about attorneys that you have found there are a number of websites you can use to review an attorney s background experience discipline history and client feedback some of these sites include avvo com findlaw lawhelp org and lawyers com visit these sites type in the name of an attorney you are interested in and see what has been said about them however be aware that client feedback can be positive or negative for any number of reasons and it may not reflect the true nature of the attorney s abilities for example a positive review may come from a longtime friend who is simply trying to put in a good word for their buddy on the other hand a negative review could be from a client who lost a case even though the attorney performed well once you have narrowed down your list of possible candidates to about three you should take part in an initial consultation with each of them during your initial consultation you will be asked to briefly outline why you want to hire an attorney in addition you will have the opportunity to ask as many questions as you want some of the questions you may want to ask include how many irrevocable trusts they have written how many of their trusts have been challenged in court if they have had any discipline as an attorney andhow their fee arrangement works after the consultations choose the attorney that you feel most comfortable with the attorney you choose should offer a fair fee arrangement be trustworthy not have a history of discipline and should know the legal issues surrounding your reason for hiring them before you decide which type of trust you will be setting up it is helpful to understand the difference between these two type of trusts which centers on how much control you wish to have over your assets if you set up a revocable trust you can rewrite and change the terms of the trust as much as you would like during the lifetime of the trust once you set up an irrevocable trust however you place all control over the trust into the hands of the trustee the person you designate to manage your trust and you will need the consent of everyone involved to change the terms of the trust an irrevocable trust involves three parties you the person managing the trust and the people who will ultimately receive the assets placed into the trust you will be permanently transferring control of any assets placed into the trust to the person managing the trust referred to as the trustee one reason you may wish to set up an irrevocable trust is to make sure that a disabled loved one is properly cared for because the terms of an irrevocable trust are not easily changed you can rest assured that this person will be provided for using the assets in the trust in addition you can word the trust in such a way that the trustee will be able to use the funds to provide for the disabled beneficiary without limiting that person s ability to apply for need based government benefits because he or she doesn t actually own the property placed into the trust another common reason to establish an irrevocable trust is to shield your assets from potential professional or creditor liability creditors cannot legally access the money you place into an irrevocable trust note however that if you set up an irrevocable trust to protect your assets from creditors while you have legal or credit problems pending you may be liable for fraud still another reason to set up this kind of a trust is to safeguard the inheritance your children will receive if your children lack financial savvy setting up a managed irrevocable trust is a way to provide for them in a more controlled way than simply giving them a lump sum gift this type of trust can also ensure your children will receive their rightful inheritance in the case of a hotly contested divorce an irrevocable trust can also provide a certain amount of tax sheltering for assets that appreciate in value over time for example if you were to simply give away a piece of real estate the asset s value for tax purposes would be the same as if you still possessed it however if you gift the same property using an irrevocable trust when it is inherited the taxable value will be adjusted to reflect its appreciated value resulting in far less tax liability for the person who receives it you can also set up the trust so that all income generated by the trust is tax deferred until the beneficiaries actually receive it because you will be transferring property out of your control you will also receive tax benefits because you will no longer have to pay taxes on property placed into the trust as it is no longer legally yours due to the fact that the terms of an irrevocable trust cannot be easily modified placing assets into a trust with a particular set of individuals or charities named as beneficiaries can ensure that your money goes where you want it to after you pass away while you won t be able to directly control the assets after they are placed into the trust you control how and to who they will be disbursed when you create the trust document and you can rest assured that your assets will be distributed according to your intentions when a person passes away his or her possessions become property of his or her estate before these assets can be distributed according to the terms of the decedent s will the will must go through a process called probate which refers to the legal proceeding required to prove the will and its terms are legal and genuine setting up an irrevocable trust allows any assets you place into it to avoid the probate process when you pass away this also has privacy benefits as courts and with them the public record will not be able to touch or see the trust property upon the death of the grantor you can place almost anything of value to which you hold legal title into an irrevocable trust this includes property real estate insurance policies family heirlooms businesses cash stocks bonds art or vehicles there is no limit as to the value of the property you can place in an irrevocable trust the trustee you name in your trust document will be the person responsible for managing your trust because the trustee will be the person with sole control over how the assets placed into the trust will be managed and disbursed and how the terms of the trust will be executed it is of vital importance that you are confident that this person is dependable honest and qualified to both make financial decisions and execute the trust in the way you intend consider naming a successor trustee who will manage the trust in the event the original trustee can no longer act as the trustee for whatever reason consider appointing a trusted family member as your trustee to save on the costs of an independent trustee you can designate co trustees if you are not comfortable with one person managing all of your trust assets you also must determine who will be the beneficiaries of your trust i e who will receive the assets placed into the trust you are not limited to naming relatives as beneficiaries of the trust they can be anyone including friends employees charitable organizations public institutions etc consider naming successor beneficiaries who will receive the trust assets if the original beneficiaries pass away if the trust has no beneficiaries the property goes back to your estate you do not have to specifically name all beneficiaries if you wish to leave a part of the trust assets to future children or grandchildren you may name my current and future children or my children and any other children i may have in the future as a beneficiary you will also provide in the trust document the terms under which the trustee will distribute trust property to your designated beneficiaries and when these distributions will be made for example you may wish that some of the trust property will remain in the trust for a period of time such that future generations can benefit from it instead of having the assets distributed on a more short term basis after you set up an irrevocable trust you will no longer have access to or control of the assets you place in the trust however you can still retain income generated by those assets such as rent on a piece of real estate if you wish by placing a provision to this effect in the trust document this will help you retain at least some control over the assets you will be giving away in the trust any trust you create should be completely spelled out in a written document the best way to begin this process is to obtain an example of the type of language commonly used to create irrevocable trusts reading and understanding a model trust form will help you when it comes time to draft your own trust document try looking for a model trust form in the following ways ask people you know that have set up irrevocable trusts to see a copy ask a local attorney for a model form purchase a form from an online legal document seller search the internet for sample trust forms using a model form draft a trust agreement according to the decisions you made above spell out which assets will be placed into the trust name a trustee and beneficiaries and outline the terms by which the trust assets will be distributed how when to whom etc your trust agreement should also provide for what happens to the trust and its assets in certain situations like the death or incapacity of the trustee or the death of one or all of the beneficiaries don t just obtain a model form and fill in the blanks without reading the form thoroughly because you will be surrendering control over your assets you want to make sure the trust agreement does exactly what you want it to do and nothing more read and re read the document after you are finished to make sure it unambiguously achieves its intended aim this document as written will solely control how the trust is managed and its assets are distributed it is incredibly important that it be drafted well strongly consider hiring an attorney with relevant experience to help with this process especially if the assets placed into the trust are of high value after you are satisfied with your written trust agreement you must execute it which will give the irrevocable trust give the full force of law as a separate legal entity you will have to sign and date the document and depending on your jurisdiction you may be required to have witnesses present for the signing or to have the document stamped by an official notary be sure to keep a copy of the original written trust agreement in a safe place for your records give a copy of the written trust agreement to the trustee and beneficiaries and their named successors if any because the trust is its own separate legal entity you must apply for a unique tax number to assign to the trust itself for tax purposes this number is known as a federal employer identification number and you must apply to the irs to get one you can apply for this number 1 online 2 by contacting the irs at 800 829 4933 or 3 by completing and mailing in form ss 4to the address listed on the form once you have drafted and executed the trust agreement it is time to actually place the designated assets into the trust the process differs slightly depending on the type of asset to be placed into the trust for cash or securities the trustee will open a bank account in the name of the trust and you will instruct your bank to transfer the funds to that account the trustee will use the federal employer tax identification number to create an account for the trust for real estate you will transfer the property to the trust using a deed for insurance policies you will need to complete the relevant forms from your insurance company depending on your jurisdiction you may have to register your trust with the state in which you live for example in colorado you must register your trust with the district court of the county in which the trust will be administered and pay a filing fee try consulting with a local tax or estate planning attorney to determine if your jurisdiction has any such requirements if your trust will generate more than 600 of taxable income on an annual basis the trustee will have to complete and file form 1041with the irs which is the form for u s income tax return for estates and trusts the trustee will use the expected annual income tax liability of the trust when completing this form for the first time if the beneficiaries will be paying tax on income generated by the trust rather than the trust itself paying the tax each beneficiary will need to complete and file a schedule k 1 formwith the irs

is touted as a means to do so without needing to involve any third parties despite their growing popularity most businesses still do not accept bitcoin and their usefulness as an investment is both highly questionable and potentially risky before proceeding to buy bitcoin it is important to understand what it is and it s advantages and disadvantages 1 understanding bitcoins learning the

with the legal issues surrounding bitcoin become aware of bitcoin s advantages become aware of the downsides of using bitcoin understand the risks of bitcoin as an investment store your bitcoins

bitcoins with your exchange account search for sellers on localbitcoins this is the primary site used to make face to face trades with a local seller use meetup com to find sellers negotiate the price before the meet up meet the seller in a busy public place have access to your bitcoin wallet locate a bitcoin atm near you take out cash from your bank account insert your cash into the atm bitcoin is a completely virtual currency that allows consumers a way to exchange money for free without the use of a third party like a bank credit card company or other financial institution bitcoin are not regulated or controlled by a central authority like the federal reserve and all bitcoin transactions take place in an online marketplace where users are anonymous and untraceable for the most part bitcoin allows you to exchange money instantly with anybody in the world without needing to create a merchant account or use a bank or financial institutiontransferring money does not require names meaning there is little risk of identity theft to understand bitcoin it is important to understand bitcoin mining which is the process by which bitcoin are created while mining is complex the basic idea is that each time a bitcoin transaction is made between two people the transaction is logged digitally by computers in a transaction log that describes all the details of the transaction like the time and who owns how many bitcoins these transactions are then shared publicly into something known as a block chain which states every transaction and who owns every bitcoin bitcoin miners are individuals who own computers that constantly verify the block chain to ensure it is correct and up to date they are the individuals that confirm transactions and in exchange for doing so they are paid in bitcoin which increases the supply since bitcoin is not overseen by a central authority mining ensures that the individual transferring the bitcoin has enough that the agreed upon amount is transferred and that the balance for each member of the transaction is correct afterwards recently the federal agency responsible for combating money laundering announced new guidelines for virtual currencies the updated guidelines will regulate bitcoin exchanges but will leave the rest of the bitcoin economy alone for now the bitcoin network is resistant to government regulation and it has gained a loyal following among people who engage in illegal activities like drug dealing and gambling due to the fact money can be exchanged anonymouslyfederal law enforcement may eventually conclude that bitcoin is a money laundering tool and may look for ways to shut it down shutting down bitcoin completely would be a challenge but intense federal regulation could push the system underground this would then diminish the value of bitcoins as legitimate currency bitcoins major advantages include low fees protection from identity theft protection from payment fraud and immediate settlement low fees unlike using traditional finance systems whereby the system itself like paypal or a bank is compensated with a fee bitcoin bypasses this entire system the bitcoin network is maintained by the miners who are compensated with new bitcoin protection from identity theft bitcoin usage does not require a name or any other personal information simply an id for your digital wallet the means used to send and receive bitcoin unlike a credit card where the merchant has full access to your id and credit line bitcoin users operate totally anonymously protection against payment fraud because bitcoin are digital they cannot be counterfeited which protects against payment fraud in addition transactions cannot be reversed like what occurs with a credit card charge back immediate transfer and settlement traditionally when money is transferred it involves significant delays holds or other hassles the lack of a third party means that money can be transferred directly between people with ease and it without complexities delays and fees associated with making purchases between parties that are using different currencies and providers with traditional banking if someone makes a fraudulent transaction on your credit card or your bank goes belly up there are laws in place to limit consumer losses unlike traditional banks bitcoin does not have a safety net in place if your bitcoins are lost or stolen there is no intermediary power to reimburse you for any lost or stolen bitcoins keep in mind the bitcoin network is not immune to hackers and the average bitcoin account is not completely secured against hacking or security breaches one study found 18 of 40 businesses offering to exchange bitcoins into other currencies have gone out of business with only six exchanges reimbursing their customers price volatility is also a major downside this means that the price of bitcoin in dollars fluctuates wildly for example in 2013 1 bitcoin was worth about us 13 it then quickly moved to over us 1200 and is now approximately us 573 as of 2016 08 28 this means if you are converting to bitcoin it is important to stay in it as moving back to usd could result in a significant loss of funds one of bitcoins popular uses is as an investment and this deserves a special word of caution before proceeding the main risk of investing in bitcoin is it s extreme volatility with prices moving rapidly up and down the risk of loss is substantial in addition because bitcoin s value is determined by supply and demand should bitcoin end up being subject to government regulation in any form it could reduce the amount of people who want to use bitcoin which could theoretically make the currency worthless in order to buy bitcoins you first need to create a storage site for your bitcoins and this is the first step to purchasing bitcoin currently there are two ways you can store bitcoins online store the keys to your bitcoins in an online wallet the wallet is a computer file that will store your money similar to a real wallet you can create a wallet by installing the bitcoin client which is software which powers the currency however if your computer is hacked by a virus or hackers or if you misplace the files you may lose your bitcoins always back up your wallet to an external hard drive to avoid losing your bitcoins store your bitcoins via a third party you can also create a wallet by using an online wallet via a third party site like coinbase or blockchain info which will store your bitcoins in the cloud this is easier to set up but you will be trusting a third party with your bitcoins these sites are two of the larger and more reliable third party sites but there are no guarantees about the security of these sites one of the most popular and cheapest options for keeping your bitcoins safe is a paper wallet the wallet is small compact and made of paper that has a code one of the benefits of a paper wallet is the private keys to the wallet are not stored digitally so it cannot be subject to cyber attacks or hardware failures several online sites offer paper bitcoin wallet services they can generate a bitcoin address for you and create an image containing two qr codes one is the public address you can use to receive bitcoins and the other is a private key which you can use to spend bitcoins stored at that address the image is printed on a long piece of paper that you can then fold in half and carry with you hard wire wallets are very limited in number and can be difficult to acquire they are dedicated devices that can hold private keys electronically and facility payments hard wire wallets are usually small and compact and some are shaped like usb sticks the trezor hard wire wallet is ideal for bitcoin miners who want to acquire large numbers of bitcoins but do not want to rely on third party sites the compact ledger bitcoin wallet acts as usb storage for your bitcoins and uses smartcard security it is one of the more affordable hardwire wallets on the market obtaining bitcoin through an exchange is the easiest way to obtain bitcoin an exchange works like any other currency exchange you simply register and convert whatever your currency is into bitcoin there are hundreds of available exchanges and the best exchange option depends on where you are located but the more well known exchange services include coinbase this popular wallet and exchange service will also trade us dollars and euros for bitcoins the company has web and mobile apps for more convenient bitcoin buying and trading circle this exchange service offers users the ability to store send receive and exchange bitcoins currently only us citizens are able to link their bank accounts to deposit funds xapo this wallet and bitcoin debit card provider offers deposits in fiat currency that are then converted to bitcoin in your account some exchange services allow you to also trade bitcoins other exchange services act as wallet services with limited buying and selling capabilities most exchanges and wallets will store amounts of digital or fiat currency for you much like a regular bank account exchanges and wallets are a good option if you want to engage in regular trading and don t need total anonymity when signing up for an exchange service you will need to provide personal information to the service to create an account most countries legally require any individual or financial system using a bitcoin exchange service to meet anti money laundering requirements though you are required to provide proof of your identity exchanges and wallets do not provide the same protection that banks do you are not protected against hackers or given reimbursement if the exchange goes out of business once you set up your account via an exchange service you will need to link it to an existing bank account and arrange to move funds between it and your new bitcoin account this will usually be done via a wire transfer and entails a fee some exchanges allow you to make a deposit in person to their bank account this will be done face to face rather than through an atm if you are required to link to a bank account to use the exchange service it will likely only admit banks from the country where the exchange service is based some exchanges allow you to transfer money to overseas accounts but the fees will be much higher and there may be a delay changing the bitcoins back into local currency you can arrange a meet up and negotiate prices for the bitcoins the site also has an added layer of protection for both parties if you are not comfortable with one on one trades use meetup com to look for a bitcoin meetup group you can all then decide to buy bitcoins as a group and learn from other members who have used sellers to buy bitcoins before depending on the seller you may pay a premium of around 5 10 over the exchange price for a face to face trade you can check the current bitcoin exchange rates online via http bitcoin clarkmoody com before agreeing to the seller s rate you should also ask the seller if they prefer to be paid in cash or via an online payment service some seller may allow you to use a paypal account to pay though most seller prefer non reversible cash as payment a reputable trader will always negotiate the price with you before you meet up many will not wait too long to meet up once the price is finalized in case bitcoin s value takes a dramatic shift avoid meeting in private homes you should take all the precautions especially if you are carrying cash on you to pay the seller for the coins when you meet the seller face to face you will need to access your bitcoin wallet via your smartphone tablet or laptop you will also need internet access to confirm the transaction has gone through always check that the bitcoin has been transferred into your account before you pay the seller bitcoin atms are a relatively new concept but they are growing in number you can use an online bitcoin atm map to find an atm near you many institutions around the world now offer bitcoin atms from universities to local banks most bitcoin atms only accept cash as they are not set up to process debit or credit card transactions then scan your mobile wallet qr code or access the codes needed from your account via your smartphone to load bitcoins onto your wallet exchange rates at bitcoin atms can vary from 3 to 8 on top of the standard exchange price 
query	37	get over having missed your prom so you missed your prom maybe you were home schooled and didn t have one maybe you had really overprotective parents who didn t let you go maybe you were grounded maybe you had a personal or family emergency and could not make it or you didn t have a date at the time or just maybe your school didn t have a prom to begin with either way you still have a sense of regret about missing your prom or you probably wouldn t even be here steps recreating the prom you never had prom crashing going to an actual prom alternate ideas realize and accept that you probably did not miss out on as much as you may think you did remember that a lot of successful people in society weren t exactly prom queens or kings either choose not to let it consume your life consider the experiences you have had that those who went to prom may have missed out on give yourself an experience that most others don t have attend a formal event that is open to the public if you are currently in college at a residential campus consider going to formals don t be afraid to create your own prom experience if you still feel the need to do so if someone else caused you to miss your prom try to forgive them if at all practical think of it this way you saved lots of money consider throwing a prom party for yourself find and attend an adult prom if you live in or near a film production city consider trying to get a job as an extra in a movie with a prom scene if your high school holds an alumni prom attend that attend your high school s upcoming prom if they will allow you to go to someone else s prom as their date volunteer to be a prom chaperone rent or buy formal attire for you and your date and go out to dinner and a dance during prom season have yourself and your sweetheart photographed as prom king and prom queen if you re a woman and live in the u s or canada enter a pageant sure it s fun it s even quasi fancy but in reality for many people prom is just a formal dance with a few cheesy decorations and parting gifts a lot of people who went to prom say it was one of the best nights of their lives but there are just as many others who say it was a waste of time and money and would have rather done something more exciting there is a saying that most people who went to prom wishes they hadn t and most people who didn t wish they had taylor swift mila kunis madonna owen wilson james franco mena suvari uma thurman conan o brien diane sawyer syndicated radio host delilah and drew barrymore never attended their official senior proms though swift later attended someone else s in addition to her record company throwing a prom themed party for her when she got her first platinum album and barrymore has hosted a prom party on at least two separate occasions it s not the end of the world although it can be a fun and exciting experience prom is not usually an event that defines the rest of one s life often times people who were popular in high school lead fairly dull adult lives just as there are many celebrities who didn t go to prom there are many prom kings queens who sell insurance or work at the local supercenter true madonna was never prom queen then again how many prom queens had platinum albums you may have had an experience that few others get to have for themselves make a list and refer to it whenever you feel blue about not having prom pictures or memories this does not necessarily need to be anything even closely related to a prom maybe this is getting tickets to see your favorite rock band perform live or taking a greyhound to hollywood to see the walk of fame save up some money if you need to and treat yourself with rare experiences like these this might give you just the closure you need nearly every major city has some kind of formal events that are accessible to the public this could be anything from a charity ball for breast cancer or child abuse awareness to a film festival s opening night gala depending on what your city or area or one you re willing and able to travel to has to offer for instance most film festivals have an opening night gala that is either formal or semi formal these usually get publicity on the evening news or in local media you can dress up just as formally as you would for a prom and you ll be helping a good cause a prom is basically just a formal event in all honesty they are usually sponsored either by ballroom dance clubs and or by fraternities or sororities but many in fraternities sororities allow those outside the greek system to attend as well call a friend up and invite him her to the event if your campus is not known to have formals that are open to all students check to see if there is a ballroom dance club and if there is if they are aware of competitions a section has been added below with ideas don t worry about feeling silly or what others friends family etc think of your decision there is nothing wrong with giving yourself the closure you need no matter what anyone tells you this may be hard or impossible depending on your situation if your parents wrongfully grounded you five hours before the prom for something you didn t do and have since tried to make amends to make it up to you perhaps it is time to let it go if your brother sold your dress to a pawn shop the day of the dance to buy drugs that may be a different story depending on whether he s turned his life around and made things right with you you did not have to buy a fancy dress rent a tux or get over priced photo packages all your friends are probably broke while you might have some money left over drew barrymore and taylor swift both famously did this swift also went as a prom date for a football player who won a contest sure it might a little self absorbed and will probably be expensive but if it will give you closure and it s within your means to do so then go right ahead most people who do this tend to either hold it at a community center or make arrangements to rent out the local high school gymnasium during the summer if you really have money to burn you can rent a hotel ballroom like a lot of high schools do now anyway hire an event planning service to do all the work for you and make it extremely realistic you can even have yourself crowned prom king or prom queen if you are really feeling self indulgent hey it s okay if you re paying for the party right before you get creeped out by the terminology no an adult prom is not an x rated version of a prom it s a party that exactly resembles a prom but marketed toward adults who are either looking to re live their prom night or make up for a missed prom they often go out of their way to be realistic even crowning a king and queen you can also do an internet search on adult prom to see what the options are in your area before you cross this off as a completely ludicrous idea consider the following movies with prom scenes are typically shot at least 20 times a year in cities with film industries this works best if you can reasonably pass for prom age and or if you d be willing to play a faculty extra rather than a student extra it s also only really an option if you live in or near a city where films are regularly produced i e new york los angeles toronto vancouver keep in mind that auditions probably won t be held during prom season prom s a popular topic and a movie that is released in the spring in time for prom season is usually shot 6 to 18 months ahead of release some high schools hold special alumni proms not to be confused with reunions as fundraisers alumni and faculty are allowed to attend these events are usually semi formal to formal some high schools allow alumni to attend prom if they wish to do so others may require a little coaxing usually in the form of a donation late wendy s founder dave thomas had dropped out of school to serve in the military but later got his ged 35 years later and went to his high school s next prom with his wife that year many schools not only allow but encourage alumni to attend future proms don t expect to be crowned king or queen you won t be eligible and even if you were would that really be fair to this year s class but at least you ll have a prom this option will work best if you have a really good reason for having missed your prom military service etc and or if you are in the financial position to make a reasonable donation to the school some schools don t care as long as you buy a prom ticket taylor swift famously did this in addition to having a prom party thrown for her after her first record went 1 and it was even the subject of an mtv reality show where dateless high school boys were offered a chance to have her as their prom date now unless you re famous you won t be able to have your own reality tv show to find someone to take you to prom with them but there are other ways to go to someone else s prom as their date there are actually websites such as prom date depot www promdatedepot com which allow people to find or become prom dates note you may need to get special permission from the school in advance and should always inquire with the school regarding their policy about prom guests this may not be an option if you re older than about 20 24 granted this is not the same as actually going to your own prom but high schools need chaperones at every prom every year prom chaperones are responsible adults who attend the prom with the students to ensure the safety of the students attending as well as to prevent improper conduct you won t be all that popular and forget about being crowned king or queen but you ll be at a prom chaperones are typically parents of students and or alumni but most high schools will gladly take any extra volunteers for chaperones they can get if you have a clean record this might be a viable option for you don t worry what other people think or if they stare at you you re not doing anything wrong or breaking any laws as a really cool alternative travel to someplace spectacular like las vegas or times square to do this you might just find you re not the only couple re creating your prom night you

query	39	join the amish it is very uncommon for people who were not brought up in an amish community to become amish yet despite popular belief the amish do not have any rules or bylaws that prohibit membership by englishers and people have successfully joined before be aware that joining the amish will take perseverance determination and above all a strong desire to live a simple virtuous life which places god and family values above all else if you are interested in joining the amish this article will outline the practical steps you ll need to take researching amish communities adjusting to the amish way of life embracing amish religion learn as much as you can about the amish visit an amish community decide if you still wish to join move into an amish community purchase a house and some farmland if possible learn pennsylvania dutch learn to live without modern comforts get a horse and buggy learn to dress appropriately avoid being photographed participate in a barn raising study the most important aspects of amish religion attend and host church services get baptized get married become an elected member of the church if you re a man before deciding to join the amish it is imperative that you learn as much about their religion history and lifestyle as possible the amish communities of today are descendants of swiss anabaptists who came to the united states in the early 1700s there are approximately 250 000 people living in amish communities across north america the largest amish community is in holmes county in the state of ohio although there are other sizable amish populations in pennsylvania iowa and indiana and smaller communities across the eastern and mid western states as well as in canada amish is a stricter branch of the mennonite anabaptist church with which it shares many beliefs and practices the amish with other anabaptists reject infant baptism in favor of adult baptism giving an adult the right to choose their religion and commit to joining the amish community the amish refer to themselves as the plain people and to anyone outside of the amish community regardless of religion or race as englishers or high people there are many informative websites and books available that cover every aspect of amish life you should do your best to visit an amish community as part of your research this will give you some insight into what the day to day life of an amish person is like despite popular belief there are no restrictions on english people visiting amish communities you can visit amish businesses and converse with the people most of whom will be willing to answer any questions you might have it may even be possible to stay in a bed and breakfast run by a local amish family this will give you an even closer look at the amish way of life which places god and family above all else if possible try to visit several communities on your trip as different amish communities will vary slightly in terms of their customs traditions and level of strictness and you will need to find the one to which you are best suited if you cannot travel to an amish community you may be able to set up correspondence with an amish person to gain an insight into their beliefs and way of life the amish do not allow computers or in most cases telephones so communicating by post will be your only option remember to respect their beliefs and do not take any identifiable photographs of them the second commandment exodus 20 4 thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image they may allow you to take pictures of their buggy or farms if you ask politely however be aware that some may not feel comfortable especially women with talking to outsiders extensively about their faith or lifestyle since they are taught to be modest in everything they do after visiting one or several communities you need to decide which community you would like to join once you have developed a short list of about 3 to 5 communities you should begin contacting the leading bishop of each community to gauge whether you would be welcome to join their church finding the leading bishop should not be too difficult if the community is on your short list you have probably already visited it and hopefully developed some contacts there who can help you although the amish do not have any rules forbidding outsiders from joining it is highly unusual and typically not encouraged so contacting the bishop is a good way to judge what the community s reaction to a newcomer is likely to be if the bishop is open to the idea of you joining their community he will invite you for an interview where you can put forward your reasons for wanting to become a member of the amish you will need to demonstrate the strength of your faith your willingness to renounce the ways of the modern world and your commitment to the amish way of life as long as your motives are pure and you are fully aware of what life in an amish community entails there should be no objection to you coming to live in the community once you have made your decision and you have received the bishop s permission you may begin your new life as a member of the amish you will first be placed with an amish family where you can learn their ways and participate in the household duties during this time you must prove yourself to the amish by living according to their religious principles and becoming a productive and valuable member of the community once you have done this there is no set time period you may be voted into the church and become a true member of the amish community unless you are coming from another branch of the anabaptist church with a very similar lifestyle you are likely to find the transition to amish living somewhat difficult living without electricity cell phones and motor vehicles is a lot harder for someone who is used to having these luxuries than it is for people who were brought up in the amish community and don t know any differently although some amish may be very welcoming and helpful to you as you make your transition others may be more distrustful of you and not expect you to last very long give them time once you prove your faith and commitment they will grow to trust and accept you once you have been voted into the church and no longer need to live with a host family you may look for a place of your own most amish live in farmhouses surrounded by land that can be used for growing crops and raising animals as the amish try to be as self sufficient as possible unfortunately available farmland is becoming harder to find due to urban sprawl high demand for land from an ever growing amish community even though new people rarely join the average amish family has seven children and prohibitively high costs you will also need to keep in mind that your home will need to be close enough to the center of the community that it can be reached by horse and buggy the major method of transportation this will limit you to about a 10 15 mile 16 24 km radius pennsylvania dutch is a dialect of german which is widely spoken by the amish community it is the main language spoken in the home and at church although amish children do learn to speak english in school pennsylvania dutch is primarily a spoken language with no standardized form of writing or spelling and must be learned to become fully immersed in the amish community as a newcomer to the amish community learning to speak the new language will be difficult but not impossible you will pick it up just by listening to others attending church services and by making an effort to speak it whenever you get the opportunity it may also be possible to hire a pennsylvania dutch tutor who can help you to improve at a faster pace the term pennsylvania dutch is a misnomer as the language has no association with the netherlands it is in fact a dialect of german that was spoken in parts of switzerland tyrol and the rhineland it is believed the term dutch comes from an archaic form of english which referred to any continental germanic language the amish aim to live a life of simplicity unfettered by the materialistic trappings of the modern world however learning to live without modern comforts can be quite a challenge for people who haven t been brought up in the amish way learning to live without electricity which the amish consider to be worldly and unnecessary will perhaps be the greatest challenge of all depending on the strictness of the amish community you have joined your new home may or may not have running water if it does not you will need to use an old fashioned hand pump instead some homes will use natural gas to provide heat and light whereas others will use wood or coal fueled stoves telephones are not allowed in most amish households though some communities will allow for a shared phone to be installed in a shack or outhouse which can be used by several families whenever necessary in addition to restrictions on electricity and modern plumbing systems the amish forbid ownership of motorcars this is because amish communities thrive on being close knit and mutually dependent a motorcar would make cities and other english communities much more accessible and may tempt the amish to leave their faith and families behind they also believe that having a motorcar might inspire feelings of pride in its owner and pride is considered to be a serious sin as a result amish communities use a horse and buggy for transport which is sufficient for covering the distance required to get to church visit neighbors and make the trip to amish supply stores consult with your neighbors on where you can get a horse and buggy of your very own while they can t own or drive a car the amish are willing to accept rides and even hire drivers if a necessary trip must be made to visit far flung relatives receive medical treatment or procure supplies unavailable in amish stores the amish style of dress is very distinctive and must be strictly adhered to by both men and women clothes must be plain and unadorned in solid dark colors made from simple durable fabrics the simplicity of dress is meant to reflect the amish way of life which is practical and unmaterialistic vanity or the concept of taking pride in one s appearance are forbidden in amish culture men should wear straight cut suits without pockets collars or belts which women should wear high necked long sleeved full skirted dresses covered by an apron any form of patterned fabric ornamentation or jewelry is not permitted men should remain clean shaven until after marriage when they are required to let their beard grow mustaches are not permitted and haircuts can only be given by amish barbers women must wear their hair in a braid or bun which is then covered by a prayer covering which is a symbol of their subjection to god amish people will avoid having their picture taken whenever possible this is because they believe that photographs are a form of graven image which is forbidden by the bible they also believe that having photographs of themselves may inspire vanity which is forbidden and considered a sin there are however some exceptions to this rule some amish will allow themselves to be photographed as long as their hands or hats cover their faces other are okay with being filmed or photographed as long as they are shot in a natural setting where it s clear that they are not posing for the camera barn raisings are an integral part of amish tradition they represent some of the most important amish cultural values acting selflessly and working together for the good of the community they are a good example of what is referred to as a frolic an amish work event that combines socializing with a practical purpose by participating in a barn raising you get a chance to interact with your neighbors while making a meaningful contribution to the community men from the amish community work together to build the barn from scratch according to the plans drawn up by one or two master engineers they supply all the labor free of charge and may donate supplies and livestock the project may take as long as a week to complete women participate in the barn raisings by cooking for the men while children help with smaller tasks involved in the building and running errands the amish believe the best way to express their religious beliefs is to practice the teachings of the bible in their daily lives they do not rely on ostentatious or elaborate religious ceremonies and rituals they live by the biblical instruction be not conformed to this world romans 12 2 which informs their practice of living humbly separate from the modern world two of their most important abiding principles are those of demut which means humility and gelassenheit which entails calmness gentleness and surrendering yourself to god s will the amish place great importance on individual study of the bible which is considered to be the only source of religious authority however you should also get your hands on a copy of a book called martyr s mirror a highly respected publication which chronicles the history of the amish people and honors those who dies for their faith it should also be noted that although the amish place utmost importance on living according to the teachings of the bible they do not believe that this is a guaranteed path to salvation they believe that any claim to be saved is an expression of pride and is therefore forbidden amish church service are held every second sunday at the home of one of their community members each amish family is expected to host their friends and neighbors for church about once a year every church district owns a collection of wooden benches which is transported by wagon to the home of the church family and set up in their house and barn seating is arranged with men and boys on one side and women and girls on the other the service lasts approximately three hours and is followed by a light lunch the service is said by 3 to 7 ministers and bishops with the scriptures being read in high german the main themes preached by the ministers include living a humble and virtuous life in the eyes of god and the idea of judge not lest ye be judged personal prayer time is also included with the congregation kneeling on the floor in silent worship although musical instruments are not permitted by the church singing is an important part of every amish service the congregation sings from a special hymnal called the ausband a high german songbook which dates back to the 16th century the singing is always done in unison never in harmony the amish receive holy communion twice a year as mentioned before the amish are a branch of the anabaptist church which believes in adult baptism the amish are usually baptized between the ages of 17 and 22 and this ceremony marks their formal membership of the church and a commitment to always live by the ordnung a set of unwritten rules which outlines the behavioral standards all amish are expected to adhere to the decision to be baptized must be completely personal and voluntary you must willingly commit yourself to the church for the rest of your life young people are free to leave the amish community before they are baptized and while some of them do most will decide to commit themselves to the church once baptized you will be committed to living your life according to the rules of the ordnung if you break this commitment and fail to repent for your sins you may be shunned by the community where people will avoid having any social contact with you and you will be forced to eat your meals separately from your family if you repent you will be accepted back into the community in time but if you continue to sin you may be excommunicated from the church members of the amish community can only marry once they have been baptized and are required to marry other amish though a couple may come from two different amish communities most of a couple s courtship is done in secret with the engagement only being published several weeks before the marriage most weddings occur in the fall after the autumn harvest and are a joyous occasion celebrating the union of two baptized adults who promise to continue living according to amish traditional values and to pass their faith on to their children an amish wedding ceremony is quite different to that of the english no rings are exchanged there are no flowers or music and the bride traditionally makes her own dress which is blue or purple in fact the ceremony is very similar to a regular church service except there is a greater emphasis on the ordinance of marriage which is taken particularly seriously as divorce is forbidden by the amish church after the ceremony a huge feast is held at the home of the bride s parents with as many as 200 to 300 guests the guests are often served in separate sittings followed by the singing of hymns the couple s honeymoon period is spent visiting all of their relatives over the course of several weekends at which point they will also collect their wedding gifts once an amish man is married he will begin to grow his beard the symbol of a married man the couple will usually be ready to move into a home of their own by the spring following their wedding amish bishops and deacons are chosen differently from church leaders in other faiths groups of men are first elected by the congregation and then lots are drawn to decide who will become the new minister only baptized married amish men are eligible to become ministers and they are obligated to accept the responsibility once they have been nominated they will usually serve in this ministerial position for life amish bishops and ministers do not receive any formal theological training they are simply called upon by their community to uphold and enforce the teachings of the bible and the rules of the ordnung the system for drawing lots works by placing a sheet of paper with a bible verse into the pages of a songbook this songbook is then arranged in a row of other songbooks each nominated man must choose a songbook and whoever picks the songbook with the bible verse concealed inside is said to have been chosen by god to serve the amish church

such that the second row is all zeroes except for the pivot row reduce such that the first row is all zeroes except for the pivot divide so that each pivot is 1 understand the case of inconsistency understand the case of dependency a system of two variables is not very difficult to solve so row reducing doesn t have any advantages over substitution or normal elimination however this process becomes much slower as the number of equations goes up row reduction allows you to use the same techniques but in a more systematic way below we consider a system of 4 equations with 4 unknowns x1 x2 2x3 12x1 x2 2x4 2x1 x2 x3 x4 42x1 x2 2x3 0 displaystyle begin aligned x 1 x 2 2x 3 1 2x 1 x 2 2x 4 2 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 4 2x 1 x 2 2x 3 0 end aligned it is helpful for purposes of clarity to align the equations such that by looking from top to bottom the coefficients of each variable are easily recognized especially since the variables are only differentiated by subscripts the matrix equation ax b displaystyle a mathbf x mathbf b is the basic foundation of row reduction this equation says that a matrix acting on a vector x displaystyle mathbf x produces another vector b displaystyle mathbf b recognize that we can write the variables and constants as these vectors here x x1 x2 x3 x4 displaystyle mathbf x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 where x displaystyle mathbf x is a column vector the constants can be written as a column vector b displaystyle mathbf b what s left is the coefficients here we put the coefficients into a matrix a displaystyle a make sure that every row in the matrix corresponds to an equation and every column corresponds to a variable 11202 10 21 1 112 120 x1x2x3x4 1 240 displaystyle begin pmatrix 1 1 2 0 2 1 0 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 0 end pmatrix begin pmatrix x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 end pmatrix begin pmatrix 1 2 4 0 end pmatrix as shown a vertical bar separates the coefficients written as a matrix a displaystyle a from the constants written as a vector b displaystyle mathbf b the vertical bar signals the presence of the augmented matrix a b displaystyle a mathbf b 112012 10 2 21 1 1142 1200 displaystyle left begin array cccc c 1 1 2 0 1 2 1 0 2 2 1 1 1 1 4 2 1 2 0 0 end array right now that we have the system of equations as a matrix we need to manipulate it so that we get the desired answer there are three row operations that we can perform on the matrix without changing the solution in this step a row of a matrix will be denoted by r displaystyle r where a subscript will tell us which row it is row swapping simply swap two rows this is useful in some situations which we ll get to a bit later if we want to swap rows 1 and 4 we denote it by r1 r4 displaystyle r 1 leftrightarrow r 4 scalar multiple you can replace a row with a scalar multiple of it for example if you want to replace row 2 with 5 times itself you write r2 5r2 displaystyle r 2 to 5r 2 row addition you can replace a row with the sum of itself and a linear combination of the other rows if we want to replace row 3 with itself plus twice row 4 we write r3 r3 2r4 displaystyle r 3 to r 3 2r 4 if we want to replace row 2 with itself plus row 3 plus twice row 4 we write r2 r2 r3 2r4 displaystyle r 2 to r 2 r 3 2r 4 we can do these row operations at the same time and among the three row operations the latter two will be the most useful a pivot is the leading coefficient of each row it is unique to each row and column and identifies a variable with its equation let s see how this works in general the first pivot will always be the top left number so x1 displaystyle x 1 has its equation in our case the first pivot is the 1 on the top left if the top left number is a 0 swap rows until it is not in our case we don t need to when this happens after we have identified all of our pivots the matrix will be in row echelon form the row in which the pivot rests does not change replace row 2 with itself minus twice row 1 this guarantees that the element in row 2 column 1 will be a 0 replace row 3 with itself minus row 1 this guarantees that the element in row 3 column 1 will be a 0 replace row 4 with itself minus twice row 1 the element in row 4 column 1 will be a 0 since these row operations pertain to different rows we can do them simultaneously there is no need to write out four matrices as part of showing your work these row operations can be summarized below r2 r2 2r1r3 r3 r1r4 r4 2r1 displaystyle begin aligned r 2 to r 2 2r 1 r 3 to r 3 r 1 r 4 to r 4 2r 1 end aligned 112010 3 4 2 40 2 3130 3 20 2 displaystyle left begin array cccc c 1 1 2 0 1 0 3 4 2 4 0 2 3 1 3 0 3 2 0 2 end array right the second pivot can be anything from the second column except that in the first row because the first pivot already makes it unavailable let s choose the element in row 2 column 2 bear in mind that if a pivot not on the diagonal is chosen you must row swap so that it is perform the following row operations such that everything below the pivot is 0 r3 3r3 2r2r4 r4 r2 displaystyle begin aligned r 3 to 3r 3 2r 2 r 4 to r 4 r 2 end aligned 112010 3 4 2 400 171700222 displaystyle left begin array cccc c 1 1 2 0 1 0 3 4 2 4 0 0 1 7 17 0 0 2 2 2 end array right the third pivot cannot be from the first or second rows let s choose the element in row 3 column 3 notice a pattern here we are choosing pivots along the diagonal of the matrix perform the following row operation after doing so the fourth pivot automatically comes out as the lower right element of the matrix r4 r4 2r3 displaystyle r 4 to r 4 2r 3 112010 3 4 2 400 17170001636 displaystyle left begin array cccc c 1 1 2 0 1 0 3 4 2 4 0 0 1 7 17 0 0 0 16 36 end array right this matrix is in row echelon form now the pivots have been identified and everything to the left and below the pivots is 0 keep in mind that this is a row echelon form they are not unique for different row operations may yield a matrix that looks nothing like the one above you can immediately net x4 94 displaystyle x 4 frac 9 4 and proceed to substitute to get all other variables this is called back substitution and is what computers use after reaching row echelon form to solve systems of equations however we will continue to row reduce until there stands nothing but the pivots and the constants unlike ordinary row echelon rref is unique to the matrix because it requires two additional conditions the pivots are 1 the pivots are the only non zero entry in their respective columns then if the system of equations has one unique solution the resulting augmented matrix will look like i x displaystyle i mathbf x where i displaystyle i is the identity matrix this is our end goal for this part unlike obtaining row echelon form there is not a systematic process by which we identify pivots and row reduce accordingly we just have to do it it is helpful to simplify before proceeding however we can divide row 4 by 4 doing so makes the arithmetic easier 112010 3 4 2 400 171700049 displaystyle left begin array cccc c 1 1

array right r2 r3 r2 displaystyle r 2 to r 3 r 2 then r2 r4 2r2 displaystyle r 2 to r 4 2r 2 then simplify the second row 112010 200 30040 500049 displaystyle left begin array cccc c 1 1 2 0 1 0 2 0 0

immediately gives us the solution to our original equation as i x displaystyle i mathbf x we are now done x1 2x2 3 2x3 5 4x4 9 4 displaystyle begin aligned x 1 2 x 2 3 2 x 3 5 4 x 4 9 4 end aligned the example we went through above had one unique solution in this part we go through cases where you encounter a row of 0 s in the coefficient matrix after row reducing as best as you can to row echelon form you may encounter a matrix similar to below the important part is the row with the 0 s but also notice that we lack a pivot in the third row 14210 4 140001 displaystyle left begin array ccc c 1 4 2 1 0 4 1 4 0 0 0 1 end array right that row of 0 s says that the linear combination of the variables with coefficients of 0 add up to 1 this is never true so the system is inconsistent and has no solution if you reach this point you are done perhaps in the row of 0 s the constant element in that row is also a 0 like so 14210 4 140000 displaystyle left begin array ccc c 1 4 2 1 0 4 1 4 0 0 0 0 end array right this signals the presence of a dependent solution a solution set with infinitely many solutions some may ask you to stop here but not every x displaystyle mathbf x is a solution to see what the actual solution is row reduce to rref 1015011 4 10000 displaystyle left begin array ccc c 1 0 1 5 0 1 1 4 1 0 0 0 0 end array right the third column lacks a pivot after reducing to rref so what does this matrix say exactly remember that the pivot assigns a row to that variable as its equation so since the first two rows have pivots we can identify x1 displaystyle x 1 and x2 displaystyle x 2 x1 x3 5x2 14x3 1 displaystyle begin aligned x 1 x 3 5 x 2 frac 1 4 x 3 1 end aligned the first equation is the equation for x1 displaystyle x 1 while the second equation is the one for x2 displaystyle x 2 now solve for both x1 5 x3x2 1 14x3 displaystyle begin aligned x 1 5 x 3 x 2 1 frac 1 4 x 3 end aligned this is where dependency comes from both x1 displaystyle x 1 and x2 displaystyle x 2 rely on x3 displaystyle x 3 but x3 displaystyle x 3 is arbitrary here it is a free variable no matter what it is the resulting pair of x1 displaystyle x 1 and x2 displaystyle x 2 will be a valid solution to the system to account for this reparameterize the free variable by setting x3 t displaystyle x 3 t x1 5 tx2 1 14t displaystyle begin aligned x 1 5 t x 2 1 frac 1 4 t end aligned of course plugging in a value for t displaystyle t and presenting the resulting x displaystyle mathbf x as a solution does not give the general solution rather the general solution isx 5 t 1 14tt t r displaystyle mathbf x begin pmatrix 5 t 1 frac 1 4 t t end pmatrix t in mathbb r in general you may encounter n displaystyle n free variables in this case all that is required is that you reparameterize n displaystyle n dependent variables 
query	41	burn a dvd dvds are one of the most common ways to store backup and transfer files they are also a great way to play movies from your computer on nearly any dvd player if you have a dvd burner you can quickly create dvds using tools included in most modern operating systems if you want to make a video dvd that works in most dvd players you ll need the help of some free software choosing the correct dvd disc format video dvds data dvds isos and other disc images learn what formats of disc are suitable for your drive burning software purpose and devices as well as the playback equipment you intend to view it on look at the format symbols icons on the packaging the disc themselves in the device user manuals or the device before purchasing a disk set look for the icon video dvd video with a disc on the burning and playback devices download and install a dvd authoring program create a new video project in your dvd authoring program add your video file s to the new project

your computer s file explorer drag files and folders into the blank disc s window identify the disc image file insert a blank dvd into your burner open the image burning software start the burning process before you invest money on new blank dvd do a little research and get to know which formats are compatible with your devices knowing this before you purchase a huge pack of discs will prevent frustrating and costly mistakes dvd r means the disc is rewritable and you can with appropriate software delete files off the disc and replace with new ones the file will just hide under the new ones and take up some disc space dvd r means the disc is not erasable and cannot be reused although files can be copied to another drive and burned on a new disc rom means it s read only media that can not be erased and is permanently burned onto the disc rw states the old file is erased completely taking no disc space at all after being rewritten or re burned not every dvd disc is made for burning with a computer and some discs will allow you burn a movie and menus of a dvd on the disc but not work in dvd players note which brands work better on the devices too some players are finicky about the brands of disc being played in them also some brands are thicker and more durable than others professional movie discs are an expensive grade of disc purchase dvds with the same icon this format will very likely to work properly with the used device purchase only dvd r disc formats for this purpose many players don t play discs with dvd r format correctly and the menus on the dvd may not function right when burned on that format you can tweak the settings of the authoring program to fix this problem but it s best left to more advanced users if you want to burn a video file to a dvd so that it can be played in any dvd player you ll need a special kind of burning program referred to as dvd authoring programs these programs will convert the video file s to the format that is recognized by standalone dvd players these programs typically don t come installed on your computer though you may have a trial or basic version that came with your dvd burner below are a few of the most popular free options for the major operating systems winx dvd author winxdvd com dvd author windows burn burn osx sourceforge net mac devede rastersoft com programas devede html linux windows no longer free dvd styler dvdstyler org en dvd flick dvdflick net out of date but is operational and with practice you can create your own custom backgrounds and buttons for windows the process varies a little bit depending on the program you are using but generally you ll be presented with a menu when you start your program allowing you to pick the type of dvd you are creating choose the video option or tab after starting your new project you can add your first video file most dvd authoring programs support all the major video formats so you typically don t need to worry about converting the files first click and drag the video into the authoring window or browse for the video file on your computer you can usually fit one full length movie onto your dvd or several hour long tv episodes oftentimes the video files that you add are not in the proper mpeg 2 format required to make a playable video dvd the extension name for this is mpeg or mpg most dvd authoring programs will convert your video file either as you add it to the project or after you re finished adding files converting the video may take a while to complete if prompted during the video conversion select the correct region for your dvd player the us and japan use ntsc while most of europe uses pal if you are using devede the conversion happens at the end of the authoring process if you are receiving errors when attempting to convert the file you may need to use a dedicated conversion program like handbrake click here for instructions on using handbrake to convert your files to a dvd compatible format flash integro or vsdc movie editor free version also converts movies into needed formats and offers many editing options like cutting and splitting as well go to the flash integro site and not the other fake ones you can also record a video in a media player like vlc or potplayer in mpeg format to convert a file as well it takes as long as the movie duration many dvd authoring programs have basic menu creation tools these allow you to create a custom menu for your video you don t need a menu for the video to be playable as you can have it just automatically start playing when the disc is inserted in burn for mac click the gear button and select use dvd theme to enable a basic menu for your dvd when creating the menu avoid placing buttons along the very edge of the frame the edge is often cut off by older tvs and dvd players once the video is converted and the menu has been created you can start the burning process insert a blank dvd r into your computer s dvd burner this is the best disc format for creating video dvds as dvd r is compatible with the widest range of dvd players some older dvd players will not be able to play any burned dvds regardless of format if your computer opens the autoplay window when you insert the blank disc just close it again the process will vary depending on the program you are using there are a few settings that you ll want to check before you actually burn the project to the disc set the write speed low while it may be tempting to set the speed to max or another high value this can lead to errors on the disc which will prevent it from playing the best way to ensure that your disc will work is to burn at 2x or 4x only if you haven t been prompted to select your region yet check the burn menu for the ntsc for pal option and select the appropriate one after reviewing your settings start the burn process by clicking start or burn if your videos weren t converted yet they ll be converted before being burned the entire process may take a while especially if you ve lowered the burn speed try to avoid using your computer while it is converting and burning as this could slow the process down or cause errors if you re using devede the program will only create an iso disc image file you ll need to then burn the iso file yourself see this section for more information once the burning and converting process is complete you should be able to play your new disc in most dvd players remember not all dvd players support burned dvds especially older models if you re creating archives of your data or don t want someone else overwriting what you ve put on the disc use a dvd r or dvd r dl dual layer if you want to be able to rewrite and edit the content on the disc use a dvd rw most modern operating systems allow you to burn data dvds directly from your file explorer without any additional software opening the blank disc will allow you to add files and folders in windows 7 and later you ll be prompted to select whether you want to use the disc like a usb drive or like a traditional finished dvd selecting like a usb flash drive will allow you to rewrite the disc even if it isn t a rewriteable disc but it will only work in windows selecting with a cd dvd player will make the disc act like a traditional disc that will need to be finalized and can only be used once if you are using os x the blank disc will appear on your desktop double click it to open it in the finder you won t lose the original copies of the files you can fit about to 4 38 gb worth of data onto a single blank dvd r the status bar at the bottom of the window will display how much space you have left once you re finished adding files you can finalize your disc and eject it so that you can use it on other computers the process is a little different depending on your operating system and settings if you selected like a usb flash drive in windows just eject your disc after you re finished adding files and the disc will be made ready to use on other windows computers this may take a minute or so if you selected with a cd dvd player in windows click the finish burning button to finalize the disc this may take a few minutes if you re using os x click the burn button next to the disc name in the left sidebar disc image files are exact copies of a dvd or cd that need to be burned to a blank disc before thy can be used this will turn the disc into a copy of the original there are a variety of disc image file types that you may have downloaded the most common file type is iso and you can use built in software in windows 7 and later or in os x to burn these to a blank disc other disc image formats include cdr bin cue dmg cdi and nrg if you are using windows vista or xp or you are trying to burn an image file other than iso you ll need to install an image burning program one of the most popular programs for windows is imgburn imgburn com burning an image file to your disc will finalize it and it won t be able to be rewritten for best results use a dvd r format disc the process varies depending on your operating system and installed software windows 7 8 and 10 right click on the iso file and select burn to disc this will open the

and remove the diaper and use the water and washcloth to wipe your baby s genital area wipe girls from front to back to avoid utis if you see a rash place some ointment on it open the new diaper and slide it under your baby gently lifting your baby s legs and feet move the front of the diaper up between your baby s legs over the belly then bring the adhesive strips around and snugly fasten them so the diaper is nice and secure to avoid diaper rash change your baby s diaper as soon as possible after a bowel movement using soap and water to wipe your baby let your baby go undiapered for a few hours each day to let your baby s bottom air out a bit during the first week you should carefully give your baby a sponge bath once the umbilical cord falls off you can start bathing your baby regularly around two to three times a week to do this the right way you should gather your supplies such as towels soap a clean diaper etc in advance so that your baby isn t fussing around fill the tub or baby tub with about three inches of warm water before you begin the bath here s what you should do next see if you can get help you may feel a little scared or uncertain when you bathe your baby for the first time if so see if you can get your partner or a family member involved that way one person can hold the baby in the water while the other person bathes the baby undress your baby carefully then slip your baby into the tub feet first while using one of your hands to support the baby s neck and hands continue to pour warm cupfuls of water into the bath so your baby doesn t get cold use mild soap and use it sparingly so you don t get it into your baby s eyes wash your baby with your hand or with a washcloth making sure to gently wash your baby from top to bottom and from front to back clean your baby s body genitals scalp hair and any dried mucus that has collected on your baby s face rinse your baby with cupfuls of warm water wipe your baby clean with a washcloth lift the baby out of the tub continuing to use one hand to support her neck and head be careful babies are slippery when wet wrap your baby in a hooded towel and pat your baby dry after that put a diaper and dress on your baby and kiss him so he has positive associations with being bathed you may be intimidated by how tiny and fragile your newborn seems but with a few basic techniques you should feel more confident about handling your baby in no time here are some things you should do wash or sanitize your hands before you handle your baby newborn babies are susceptible to infection because their immune systems aren t quite so strong yet make sure that your hands and the hands of anyone else who handles the baby are clean before you make contact support your baby s head and neck to hold your baby cradle his head whenever you carry him and support it when you re holding the baby upright or putting him down babies can t hold up their own heads yet so don t ever let a baby s head flop around avoid shaking your baby whether you re playing or angry this can cause bleeding in the brain which can lead to death don t try to wake up your baby by shaking it either instead tickle its feet or give it another gentle touch learn to swaddle your baby this is a great way to keep your baby feeling secure before he reaches the two month mark you have to make sure to give your baby as much head and neck support as possible when you hold it you should let the baby s head rest inside your inner elbow with the length of his body resting on your forearm his outer hip and upper legs should rest with your hand with its inside arm resting over his chest and abdomen hold the baby snugly and give your baby all of your attention you can also hold the baby by pacing his tummy on your upper chest while using the same side hand to hold his body while using the opposite hang to support the baby s head from the back if your baby has older siblings or cousins or is around people unfamiliar with holding babies carefully instruct them on how to hold the baby and make sure they are sitting down with a knowing adult nearby to keep the baby safe since your baby spends so much of its time on its back it s important to also give your baby time to stay on his tummy so that he develops both mentally and physically and strengthens his arms head and neck some doctors say babies should get 15 20 minutes of tummy time a day while others say that you should just place your baby on his tummy for 5 minutes during different parts of the day as he develops you can start with tummy time as soon as a week after the baby is born once the umbilical chord falls off to make tummy time fun get level with your baby make eye contact tickle your baby and play around tummy time is hard work and some babies will be resistant to it don t be surprised or give in if this happens your baby s umbilical cord stump should fall off within the first two weeks of its life it will change in color from a yellowish green to brown and black as it dries and falls off on its own it s important to care for it properly before it falls off to avoid infection here s what you should do keep it clean clean it with plain water and dry it with a clean and absorbent cloth make sure to wash your hands before you handle it stick to giving your baby sponge baths until it falls off keep it dry expose it to air so the base dries out keeping the front of your baby s diaper folded down so it is uncovered resist the urge to pull it off let the stump fall off at its own pace keep an eye out for signs of infection it s natural to see a bit of dried blood or a little bit of crust near the stump however you should see a doctor immediately if the stump produces a smelly discharge or yellowish pus continues to bleed or is swollen and red if your baby is upset it s not always easy to find the reason right away through there are a few tricks you can try check for a wet diaper try feeding them if that doesn t work try adding a layer of clothing if it s cold out or removing a layer if it s hot sometimes your baby just wants to be held or is experiencing too much stimulation as you get to know your newborn you ll become better at finding what s wrong your baby also may just need to be burped rocking them gently and singing or humming a lullaby to them will help give them a pacifier if that doesn t work they might just be tired so lay them down sometimes babies just cry and you have to let them until they fall asleep you can t play with the child just yet but they do get bored like we do try taking them for a walk to the park once a day talking to them putting pictures in the room where they spend most of their time listening to music or taking them in the car remember that your baby is just a baby and is not ready for rough play do not roughhouse or shake your baby and be as gentle as possible instead in the beginning the most important thing you can do is to bond with your baby this means you should stroke your baby cradle your baby give the baby some skin to skin contact or even consider giving your baby an infant massage babies love vocal sounds and it s never too early to start talking babbling singing or cooing with your baby play some music for the baby while you re bonding or play with toys that make noise such as rattles or mobiles some babies are more sensitive to touch and light than others so if your baby doesn t seem to be responding well to your attempts at bonding then you can take it easier with the noise and lights until your baby gets used to it your baby will pay frequent visits to the doctor during its first year for scheduled check ups and shots many first newborn visits occur just 1 3 days after you and your baby are discharged from the hospital after that each doctor s program will vary slightly but you should generally take your newborn to the doctor at least two weeks to a month after birth after the second month and then every other month or so it s important to schedule regular visits with your baby to make sure that your baby is growing normally and receiving the necessary care it s also important to pay a visit to your doctor in case you notice anything abnormal even if you re not sure that what is happening is abnormal you should always call the doctor s office to check some symptoms you should look out for include dehydration less than three wet diapers per day excessive sleepiness dry mouthbowel movement problems no movement during the first two days white mucus in stool flecks or streaks of red in the stool overly high or low temperaturerespiratory problems grunting flaring of nostrils fast or noisy breathing chest retractionsumbilical cord stump problems pus odor or bleeding from stumpjaundice yellow color in the chest body or eyesprolonged crying crying for over thirty minutesother illness persistent coughing diarrhea paleness forceful vomiting for more than two consecutive feedings fewer feedings than 6 per day you ll need to be prepared to take your baby on car rides before the baby is born since you ll need a way to get the baby home from the hospital you ll need to get a car seat that is appropriate for newborns and to make sure that it is secure and safe for your baby though you may not need to spend a lot of time in the car with your newborn some mothers find that taking the baby for a ride can actually help put him or her to sleep you should also get an infant seat for your baby these seats are there to help your young baby sit up not to help your baby be secured in a car in this kind of seat the base should have nonskid surfacing and should be wider than the seat and it should have a secure locking mechanism along with washable fabric never place your baby in the seat on an elevated surface that the baby can fall from as for child safety seats make sure the seat meets federal motor vehicle safety standard 213 and that it actually fits your child infants and toddles should sit in a rear facing seat until they are at least 2 years old if you re raising a baby solo then you will need as much mental and emotional strength as possible if you re lucky enough to have a spouse or a caring parent or parent in law then it s important to arrange for some extra help to be there when your baby is born if you can hire a nurse great but if not just see if you can get some extra help preferably from people who know what they re doing even if your baby spends most of his time sleeping you will be feeling a bit overwhelmed and the more help you have the more confident you ll feel about handling your baby you need a good support system for your family and you it may be a husband boyfriend or your own mom and dad you need someone always there for you and your child throughout their childhood if you re trying to raise your baby completely alone you will be likely to run into trouble or to feel exhausted that being said you should also establish visiting hours and rules having too many friends and family members show up for unexpected visits to see the baby can actually lead to more stress though it s important that you be there to take care of your baby this does not mean that you should neglect caring for yourself make sure to bathe regularly maintain a healthy diet and to get as much sleep as you can you and your spouse can work out a system where both of you have at least some time to take care of yourself while this probably won t be the time for you to take up a new hobby or to start writing a memoir you should make sure to get some exercise see your friends at least a little bit and just to have some me time when you can get it don t think that you re being selfish by wanting a bit of time to yourself after your baby has just been born if you take even a little bit of time to take care of yourself you ll be a better caretaker for your baby be easy on yourself this is not the time to clean the whole house or lose 10 pounds anything can happen especially during the first month of your baby s life make sure you haven t made too many plans and that you re prepared to give your baby the time it needs eliminate your stress in advance by letting people know that you ll be very busy with your baby and don t force yourself to socialize too much or to make appearances with your baby unless that s something you really want though you should give your baby the time it needs that doesn t mean you should be holed up in your house with your baby get out of the house as much as you can it ll be better for you and your baby even if you feel that one day with your newborn baby is 100 hours long you ll soon see that your baby will be over the newborn stage before you know it people debate whether babies stop being newborns after 28 days or up to 3 months so be prepared for all of the emotions you will feel intense joy at seeing your baby a fear that you may not be doing everything right a panic that you have lost your independence an isolation from your childless friends all of these feelings are perfectly natural and any hesitations or fears you have will fade to the background as you embark on a new life with your baby 
query	44	deal with snobby people wine snobs food snobs book snobs snobs who think their jobs clothes or outlook on life are simply better than yours sometimes nothing can be more annoying than spending time with someone who looks down on you simply because he thinks your views and way of life are somehow inferior to his when it comes to dealing with a snob the most important thing you can do is to maintain your confidence and don t let him get to you beyond that if you re willing to put in the work you can actually make a snob come around and see that your perspective is valid but if the person is just unbearable then you can also find some ways to cope standing your ground winning them over not letting them get to you don t compete with them kill them with kindness maintain your confidence don t make fun of their taste talk to them about the behavior if you know them well enough let them see that they can t hurt you find common ground challenge their expectations about you educate them about the things you like avoid topics that are likely to start a conflict consider your audience don t be a snob to them in return feel sorry for them make sure they re actually snobby and not just shy or socially awkward avoid them as much as you can don t let them affect your self image ignore them when necessary remember all of the non snobs who make you feel good you may think that fighting fire with fire is the best approach when it comes to snobs but the worst thing you can do is try to stoop down to their level if a snobby person in your circle is going on and on about his fancy vacation to milan there s no point in trying to point out that you ve been there too or that you prefer france over italy this will only make the snob more determined to prove you wrong and to show that his way of life is far superior to yours instead hear the person out without feeling the need to show that what you re doing is superior or that you re also pretty cool in some other way though it can be tempting to point out how expensive your handbag wine or painting are it s just not worth it the snob can never be out snobbed and you ll only be making yourself look bad while alienating the non snobs around you in the process you may feel like it s easier for you to breathe underwater than it is to be nice to a snobby person still when you re faced with a mean sour faced and generally unpleasant person sometimes the best thing you can do is to smile and say hi how are you the snob may even be taken aback because he s not used to being treated so nicely and may surprise you by being kind back if being nice to the snob doesn t yield a nice result then you can at least tell yourself that you tried everything before deciding that the person really is stuck up if the snob insists on acting like you don t exist you can even cheerily say hi followed by the snob s name when he walks by this will catch him off guard and hey it may make you chuckle don t let a snob make you feel inferior or like you don t know anything about anything if you waver in your ideas or doubt yourself that will only fuel the fire and give the snob free reign to make you feel terrible about yourself if you re insecure slow to respond or talk softly because you re afraid of sharing your ideas then the snob will latch right onto that and will only make you feel worse instead speak in a steady even voice and use facts to back up your ideas showing that you re not afraid to state your ideas it s one thing if you really aren t an expert on something and the snob tries to gently educate you but another if you re talking about something you feel confident about don t let a snob make you doubt how many championships the lakers have if you re positive you know the answer however if a snob who spent ten years making wine tells you something you didn t know about pinot noir it s okay to listen if you re not being condescended to remember that part about not stooping to their level the thing about snobs is that they not only have really strong opinions but that they don t like to have them challenged sinking to their level will only make them more sure about their own opinions and will make them simply annoyed that you would engage with them since they re used to arguing and being snobby they ll fight back and will make fun of your taste twice as hard and that s something you want to avoid instead of saying that the snob has terrible taste you can just mention something you like instead in a kind fashion you can say something like well i haven t seen sherlock but i really love true detective have you checked it out this works far better than saying something like that show is for losers true detective is the best show out there and everyone knows it if you re forced to spend a lot of time with a snobby person or even call one of these people a friend because you like other things about him or her then it may be time to bring up the behavior to see if the person is capable of changing you shouldn t come right out and say that the person is a snob but you can try saying something like you know you tend to make it sound like you think your way of doing things is always the right way it hurts my feelings though this won t be easy to say this may help the person change if he s willing to do so if you re afraid of using yourself as an example you can say something like you really hurt ashley s feelings when you told her her shoes looked cheap i don t think comments like that are very helpful another way to deal with snobby people is simply to show them that you re impervious to their insults if they make fun of you call something of yours inferior or just clearly go out of their way to make you and the people around you feel small then you should make sure not to flinch or respond when they re being mean or even to roll your eyes if necessary if the snob wants to start a fight about craft beers just shrug and disengage show that you re happy with who you are and that no snob can change that if you find yourself on the brink of tears just excuse yourself and step out for a minute or say you have to take a quick phone call don t let them see how upset you are don t waste your time complaining about them to others either it ll get back to them and will only give them power one way to win over a snob is to find something that you do agree with or something you do have in common maybe it turns out you were both born and raised in poughkeepsie new york maybe you re both die hard maria sharapova fans maybe you both love making your own pasta as you spend more time with the snob dig around conversationally to see if there s something you can bond over the snob will begin to see you as a person he shares interests with and will come to think of you as a person of good taste if you really do find something you have in common then you can even impress the snob with your knowledge of the subject it may take a little digging if you really feel like you and the snob have nothing in common if you have a mutual acquaintance see if that person can give you something to work with then the next time you see the snob you can say something like i didn t know you were a celtics fan too are you from boston snobs like to stereotype people in order to help them believe that their views are superior they may have a certain idea about you because you grew up in a working class neighborhood went to harvard or teach yoga though you don t have anything to prove if you want to be able to deal with snobby people sometimes the best thing you can do is to show them that you re not who they think it takes time for you to challenge a person s expectations but it ll be worth it as you help them get to know you you may find that they re not who you think either maybe you had a certain idea of the snobby person as being stuck up when you ll learn that the person is really just insecure and afraid of new people though it may not be easy one way to win over a snob is to turn him on to something you know he ll like maybe the person is a pastry snob and you know exactly which boulangerie he ll like the most maybe she s only into indie rock and you make her a cd of stones hits that you know will do the trick make an effort to show the snob that there are other exciting things out there that are worth exploring it s all in the delivery you should avoid making it sound like you re offering a superior opinion instead say something like hey if you like vampire weekend then i think you ll actually really like this velvet underground album there are some subjects that will really get a snob going and they are best to be avoided at all costs of course it depends on the snob you re dealing with if you have a wine snob don t talk about how you think napa chardonnay is the best in the world unless you want to get a lecture on french viticulture however if the snob doesn t mind talking about fashion sports or even current events then you can turn the conversation in that direction every person even a snob has a soft spot and you should focus on discussing subjects that are less likely to be controversial when dealing with your snob if the snob is really set in his ways about certain subject then there s no point in trying to fight him on the point you can talk to other people who care about your love for the beatles or yoga of course there will just be some people you don t click with if these people are snobs though you can think about what makes the snob you re dealing with angry in particular if the snob grew up in a working class neighborhood and is suspicious of wealthy people and you have a bit of money then maybe he s not the person to chat with about your sailboat and ritzy vacations if he s a huge foodie then maybe he s not the person to invite to make a daily run to chipotle if you avoid bringing up topics that are sure to annoy or offend the snob then you ll be more likely to win him or her over though you don t have to change what you talk about completely to win the snob over keeping his own prejudices and experiences in mind when you talk will make for more positive conversation the worst thing you can do is to be stuck up right back to the snob if everything fails you can just ignore the snob but there s no need to be stuck up right back don t bother making fun of the snob s taste turning up your nose at the person not being friendly or just demeaning everything that won t be much fun for you or anyone in your orbit and you don t want the snob to drag you down with him if all else fails you can approach the situation from an empathetic perspective if you ve tried to be nice to the snob tried to change his expectations and even made a point of introducing him to a new restaurant brand of coffee or clothing line that you thought he d like and have gotten nothing but cruelty in return then the best thing you can do is accept defeat and feel sorry for the snob recognize that the person is deeply insecure socially unaware and so determined to prove that he knows best that in the end his life is going to be sad lonely and pathetic this can make you feel better about being a more reasonable person and for not being able to connect with the snob think about it isn t your life so much easier because you re able to have a conversation without making people feel bad think about the difficulty the snob faces in everyday interactions even if it s his fault it still makes for a pretty miserable existence many people who are shy socially awkward or just insecure are often mistaken for being snobs you may think the person is thinking he or she is better than you simply because he or she is reluctant to make conversation seems cool socially and acts stand offish even when you try to be nice some people are just really really shy and find it hard to connect with new people this might come off as snobby but in reality the person may be as nice as can be make an effort to get to know the person better before you make a final judgment if the snob is close friends with a few people you think are normal and nice then it really may be that he or she just opens up to very few people think it through before making a final call another tactic for not letting the snob get to you is to simply avoid being around him or her as much as you can if you know the snob will be at a small party you were thinking of going to and that being around him will ruin your mood then skip out if you know the snob is likely to be hanging out in the kitchen at work then go out for lunch of course you shouldn t let the snob win and stop doing what you love for the sake of avoiding him but if being around the snob is really dragging you down then avoidance may be your best option if you don t want to let the snob affect your schedule think of strategic ways to avoid him or her when you re in the same room you can pretend to look busy on your phone actively engage in conversations with other people or even move to a different conversational circle if you re at a party if you had to spend a lot of time around a snobby person either socially or at work then you have to learn to let their comments move right past you instead of getting stuck in between your ears no other human being should dictate your self worth or make you feel inferior you are only inferior if you make yourself out to be that way and only you have the power to truly control your self image if a snobby person is bringing you down it s important to remind yourself about all of the things that make you great make a list of all of the qualities you like about yourself and all of the compliments other people have given you just because one person is being a jerk to you doesn t mean there s something wrong with you in fact it s much more likely that something is wrong with him or her though ignoring a person isn t exactly the most mature route if you tried everything and the snob is still being a real jerk then that s not very mature of him either if you re forced to be around the person but no longer care about making a good impression then the best thing you can do is roll your eyes and not engage with the snob you don t have to pretend like he s not there but you can mentally tell yourself that this person really doesn t matter to you at all this can help you avoid engaging with his snobby antics or trying to waste your energy on fighting back if you re in a group with the snob just don t make eye contact or really engage with him focus on what other people are saying instead if a snobby person in your life is getting you down just remember all of the people you actually like care for and feel good around just because one person is making you feel ugly poor or stupid doesn t mean that a single word of what he s saying is true think of all the people in your life who value you and make you feel good and don t let one jerk get under your skin instead spend time with all of the people you love and care about and you ll see that you ll feel better about the world and yourself you can even hash out something the snob said with one of your close friends if it ll make you feel better though you shouldn t give the snob too much power by talking about him too much if you just want to confirm that the snob is annoying with one of your close friends then you can talk about it your friend will assure you that you re awesome and that the snob has nothing to feel superior about 
query	45	create an overall status workbook in xl and vba for your wikihow articles those of you who love to author wikihow articles might like to have a system in place for tracking your article views and projecting when you ll reach goals you can do this by creating a workbook with a worksheet that will allow you to sort by category or view quantity find the most viewed or the zeroes the design in this tutorial includes a worksheet that tracks your related wikihows in case you have a habit of including some of your own nearly every time you write a new article while also populating old articles with the new article as a fresh related lastly there is a category analysis that lets you know how your categorizing is doing or how you might improve it either by generalizing or specifying ws article views and other preparation the header region the middle section left part of macro b section the lower macro b section data for macros monthly projections macro b section ws daily sort enter headers input formulas and data ws relateds input the relateds subtotals enter the relateds totals the macro n section of relateds ws cat analysis the top analysis section enter headers for cat analysis totals by category seen the macros of overall status open excel from the desktop green x icon on the dock or from within the applications folder in the microsoft office folder open a new workbook and save it as overall status xlsm in capital letters name four worksheets ws from left to right w o quotes as article views and other daily sort relateds and cat analysis set excel menu

editor application that has a replace all function and do replace all of with nothing disregarding the quote marks the way the macros work is as follows sub macro01 transfertodaytoyesterday j is daily run by pressing command option alt j first before getting the wikihow data here are the macros including strikethrough macro e that still needs work nan the xlsm means it contains macros for example this author has two id s because one id only allows up to 100 articles and views to be shown using the standard in built layout since more were desirable using this layout a second id was started join wikihow if you haven t already possibly as an anonymous id just so long as you can access other s user pages access in your browser https www wikihow com user chris garthwaite and go to articles started view more and click on it with your mouse carefully select the following group of articles and views without activating them by clicking just to the left of this article then dragging down fairly slowly under control until you can complete the selection with the bottom rightmost number of views for the last article do command v copy it may take a few seconds to update it may take a few seconds to update you can see from the data it s approaching 150 articles and 500 000 article views skewed by a single article in analyzing the data attention should be paid to eliminate such skewing while still being very conscious of it but for the purposes of this article it will be kept simple you will notice that those are conveniently and ever so nicely all live links now clicking on one takes you right to the article you may want to take a second to test that feature you ll notice a used one turns a different color perhaps brown or wine red that s going to prove useful what is not as useful is that it does not open a new tab in your browser but uses the last one used so you may want to hit your back button to get back to where you were page wise or use history this author uses

you like it s just a memo to save the workbook by running one of the 2 macros there are two in case something happens to the other people who have suffered losing a lot of work become a bit of a

macros will save the workbook to various folders on this author s imac so you must change the pathnames and so forth to suit yourself the macros will be done all together at the end format cells fill cells c1 c3 yellow you can get those links from your own user page by copying them from the browser window directly while in firefox or explorer or whatever and pasting them into the overall status workbook in excel input by hand the total number of article views per each id to the right these hand input totals will not agree to the worksheet totals by the amount of article views attributable to any new articles written since this article however the total lines and lower references in this article should still be correct because new articles will not have been inserted effectively above this article you can copy all the articles for chris garthwaite to a separate new workbook and figure out a reconciliation if you so desire or you can input the views of any articles since this article as one sum to be subtracted at the left in cell a3 from chris garthwaite input and xhohx input to arrive at a total in a6 equal to the total below once the other input subtotals are also brought over to a4 and a5 enter label new articles to cell b3 in that case and format alignment left format cells b4 c9 bold input to cell c6 total per wikihow and in cell b6 enter the formula b5 b4 and format both b6 and c6 font red format it font bold red size 14 and do insert names create in right column ok even though this total does not agree with the worksheet s total by the amount of new article views after this article for the chris garthwaite id you ll use the correct total wikihow figure to do the monthly projections at right the rest of the worksheet grand totals of views should agree internally this author realizes there are no numbers in column a yet and so you will have zeroes returned temporarily then edit it so that all the b s are f s and the sum approaches 500 000 or more select cell c20 and insert name define it as file save s that s 4 underlines at the end 5 total format cells for a12 font red fill yellow border red boldest outline from there it will be possible to rebuild clear total views to date if need be these daily article view totals can be copied and transposed then sorted from greatest to least value and that should correspond to their values in clear total views to date it is quite noticeable how very often article views trend similarly on the same days of the week also months of the year etc because of school and exam scheduling and other factors surround the cell with a red boldest border fill it yellow and make the font bright red you will start each day by transferring the data that was in today to yesterday via macro 01 using command option j currently that s a18 a158 when this article is completed but if this is not the topmost article then a158 will not be the bottommost cell since a new row will have been inserted for each new article at the top via macro in the cell under the last article enter other under usual circumstances the wikihow numbers will not sum to the hand input total by the amount of views of any new article views written after this article other bugs can occur rarely try refreshing the page s first however several times and give it some time the numbers come out around 5 15am pacific time and the squirrels at the wikihaus are still rubbing the sleep out of their eyes i imagine it does not happen very often more typically the page does not update from the previous day at all because of some server maintenance being done a day might get skipped please update your sheets anyway even with zeroes for the day because the macro has to be on the right day select the cell range h17 158 and do edit fill series 1 for the step value ok you ll re number for your own quantity of articles when you get all done with this and modify it for your own usage it would take too long to have you enter each star correctly so just enter a 1 in column i to the right of the article prepare a broad working capital or cash flows budget and edit fill down 59 cells which is currently accurate as to count if not as to article it gives you an idea anyway and you re just going to edit in your very own hooray notice that cells j1 j14 are blank and useful for collecting these ready to be relateds when you

input 3 5 13 and then select from 3 31 15 at next to top down to the bottom and do edit fill series and accept whatever increment is proposed instead of having to input the actual dates of authorship outline in boldest red border and under the n column average enter in the two cells beneath it average days to write next one author wrote over 200 articles per year for example this author starts each week on the slow day of saturday in cell m10 because on saturday what s actually being reported are pretty likely to be friday night s returns when a lot of people are out on dates if on the other hand your subject matter is all about dating whereas mine is about math saturday might just be your heaviest traffic day this author just likes to know what the probable low point for the week is likely to be because that can indicate an overall strong or weak week right away so for example the closest saturday to 3 31 was 3 28 so i entered 3 27 15 to cell m11 format cell m11 and n11 fill

we re getting into the next worksheet daily sort you ll notice nq 150 holds the summary information for april 2015 in nz 150 on daily sort are total article views to date over all periods therefore if for any reason total article views as held by o4 today less total article views to date less april s should be less than 0 return the value directly below in cell s5 otherwise return the total to date in o4 less the total to date in nz 150 less less plus the april views to date nq 150 the wikihow system gives us total views to date all the time it s up to us to gather each week s views and each month s views until o4 gets total views of the current day input into it by macro b it is empty so when it subtracts total views to date less april s even if april s are 0 it gets a big negative so it takes the number in s5 below it until the cell in column o to the left is updated that s fine if it happens to be april but what if it s march on the daily sort worksheet in the next cell to the left np 150 are march s total views on article views views and other n m7 is 03 31 15 and in m6 is 04 01 15 so you see why this has been saved this for last you have to manually update this formula at month s end with the correct next cell to the right from the next sheet daily sort that s 2 underlines and a 1 so it sorts to the top of the variable names list if not already done do so now down to end sub in advanced editing in wikihow and pasted into a text editor or word processor like word that has a replace all function you want to replace all without the quotes with nothing you then want to record a dummy macro in excel in the overall status xlsm workbook and paste the replace d all text over the dummy macro there are other ways to go about it but that s quick and dirty and gets the job done save the workbook run the macro either from the macros tool icon or by pressing command option alt p sub macro04 tfr views thruout p macro04 tfr views thruout p macro transfer views daily

topleft macro09 pinksave uactiveworkbook save application goto reference file save s end sub also on the transposed section in relateds the formatting will not get copied over and that will need to get fixed at some point by copying over the formatting and then manually resetting it no time for that now it should read with your head turned 90 degrees left justified vertically down with word wrap if there is ever a lingering new article name in a4 just delete it or fix the macro code to do so article views and other a 12 a 163 and transfer it exactly to nexter and beneath it it will then name the next top cell to the right nexter so that it can proceed to do the same thing the next day and each day that is the day s views not the total views as of that date will be transferred however you have just transferred with macro03 to defined cell range name 02 the total views as of today s date if you had yesterday s total views plus today s day s views you would then have today s total views separated so what you need is a starting point of total views you will then add each day s views across to become the month to date s views they will become that month s views then you will add your starting point to all the months and agree it to wikihow s total views as of today thus you will have gained insight into how you are doing per article per day and by month whereas on article views and other you were watching it for the current week average and projected month so in j1 enter 01 01 15 if 2015 is the current year and format cells number date mm dd select the cell range for all 365 days of the year or 366 days in 2016 i e over right from j1 nj1 and do edit fill series step value 1 ok for cell cv1 do insert name define nexter ok just whichever row 1 date you start the process on make sure to insert name define as nexter when nexter has updated column cv remember to do the following enter to cv3 the label don t dbl count and enter to cv4 the label this column format cells font red bold the next thing to do is to put in the bottom formulas enter to cell cv154 the formula day cv151 and enter to cv155 the formula sum cv 150 cv150 and enter to cell cv156 the formula cv155 30 cv154 put a boldest red border at the top of cell cv154 a left boldest border down cells cv154 cv156 and a bottom red boldest border for cell cv156 then put a boldest red border around each month because you will need to change the middle formula for each month you can split and freeze the screen at j5 so you can see the upper dates to make this job easier or copy them temporarily nearby below we want that to continue on through all of april and then stop and start afresh for may enter to dz155 the formula sum dz 150 dz150 and edit paste special formulas that across for all of may surround april and may and each new month with format cells border red boldest outlineenter to fe155 the formula sum fe 150 fe150 and edit paste special formulas that across for all of june do the red boldest

special formulas that across for all of december do the red boldest border for december go back and do january february and march as well please even though you ll get errors this sheet will prove useful in future years remember to do the red boldest border for each month you can hide columns you re finished studying or which contain no data it might be best to leave 01 01 showing so you remember it s all there but hidden bear in mind that macro t does not look for a date but instead for whichever cell is named nexter that is what will next be updated the article views as of 01 17 15 the starting point are included below in cells nl37 nl147 this column adds across all the activity from 1 18 15 to 1 31 15 starting in cell nm33 is the formula sum aa33 an33 and it has been copied and pasted down to nm147 in cell nn6 is the formula nl6 nm6 and that has been copied and pasted down to cell nn147 in cell no6 is the formula sum ao6 br6 and that has been copied and pasted down to no147 edit copy nl150 and edit paste it to cell range nm150 nz150 that should equal 0 and proves that the spread equals the number from wikihow counting all the 1 s of that meant counting all the article days per article on which there were 0 article views these were summed and the total column was sorted from greatest to least to find out which articles were having the most zero views days the formulas were edit paste special values back atop themselves to conserve memory and the sort was undone by sorting on article number from highest to least many various sorts are possible in this worksheet some dependent upon the categories yet to be input it s a pretty big job and it s left up to you as to whether you really want to do it or not almost every article has two categories it uses which is the current maximum available as an example of how it works in the spreadsheet rank would list something like 1 02 which would mean seen mathematics and two calculating volume and area since many articles are categorized in the same rank s sorting them by rank order is meaningful the formula is h6 i6 copied and pasted down then copied again entirely and paste special values atop itself to preserve memory if you usually only use one category you might still want to leave columnar space for two as you might someday change your mind if wikihow changes and permits 3 categories then a system of rank looking like 01 12 02 will still sort just fine as a string so long as there is actually a leading zero you may have to use a formula to add one on like this 0 rank for just the single digit leads where the rank column has been defined as defined variable name rank or 0 text rank 0 00 else 10 s might appear right after 1 s there is just really no simple way for this author to convey the spreadout of relateds article across the entire worksheet to you 142 142 20164 each cell in cell range j10 ev152 either has is blank or has a 1 in it the 1 indicating that the intersection of the horizontal row article holds the vertical article as a related wikihow vertically that means that the vertical article is held by n many horizontal articles currently if you think about it from a user s perspective it might be nice to have a way back to the article you just came from but that s not essential when allocation space is short at ten articles only max it s far more important that the article be actually related firstly and secondly it s preferable for recent articles to support current articles generally speaking on the assumption that one s readership is already acquainted with older articles it has been observed that readership of popular articles remains consistently high but that all readership of older articles declines with age it is important not only to be writing high quality new articles that earn rising star or featured article status it is also important from time to time to freshen up the older articles where possible one way of doing this is to change their relateds although the most recent 42 articles account for just 3 of total views to date they often account for around 25 of today s views that is a very important fact to know and use it means that a good portion of one s following is keeping very current with one s authorship this article already has 24 views and it is tagged with an inuse template as well as being not yet reviewed for quality so the readership is pretty hungry for the latest thing it is thought the article has modifications being made in the middle of it so it has to be re read to make complete sense and still they persist this author admires their tenacity and feels extremely devoted to them per their own devotion this author does his level best best to get it right on the first draft this author does not track other author s related wikihows the reason is because it s difficult to keep track of what the rest of the world is doing let alone just oneself however the possibility of tracking other author s relateds posted to one s articles is feasible within this system and not all that unwieldy another objective might be to delete relateds subtracted as a group that were in excess of the 10 relateds per article limit in that case you would be deleting 1 s instead of adding them the final list in b166 on should have formulas which deliver out the article name without brackets 9 use macro 07 08 n and then command v to find the article in row 1 searcher and when the input box comes up do command v paste click ok for the input box afterwards 10 use the down arrow and row heights 0 to post a 1 quickly to the article the relateds one macro run by the next or manually is faster if they are all in a row l 11 click on the next article name row in this worksheet and color it by group of about 6 15 articles and repeat until done update changes calibri body font is used mostly size 12 or 14 your favorite font is a matter of personal preference as is its size which is why it has been left until now mostly to state a preference input cells or cells which are important or may be modified other than those pasted in from wikihow may be color filled canary yellow even if the macros do the changing you may want to work out your own style system as is preferable to you the more important a cell is the more likely it is to receive a boldest border often in red it s been left up to you to adjust your row heights and column widths to automatically fit the data all along however for column a where the ready tobe relateds formulas and pasted values run quite long this author has a column width of only 5 36 more than enough and a frozen window at cell j7 cell h7 contains xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx and column i is hidden as is column f columns c d are minimal in order to see if any rising star objects somehow made it through the deletion subprocedure of macro p there is room for improvement one needs to give it serious consideration currently because no relateds have been done for this article yet there are 1416 relateds assigned out of 1420 142 articles 10 relateds article allowed 4 under however there are 271 under 10 19 41 520 at 10 36 72 for a subtotal of 55 86 at 10 or under and 625 over 10 44 14 the balance sometimes there are 11 or 12 related wikihows sometimes up to 15 all in all it is below the total allowed overall that may be a bit of fudgery and other s relateds are not counted in the system but it s felt to be fair all things considered with heavier usage articles receiving more attention and lesser used articles receiving less attention so it s proportional to what the users want actually it s meant to please the users after all sometimes it has been as much as 6 over allowed but has always been trimmed back to be within the limit the system also does not count links within an article that are not down in the relateds section e g in the article how to teach or learn math trig and xl with enthusiasm but that is a rare treatment not the standard someone counting actual links will thus arrive at a somewhat greater number this article also falls into that category but only temporarily as a model for the user to build their own article list as

relateds counts and low view counts have low relateds counts typically though some low view articles are promoted via higher relateds spreads all in all though a balance is achieved promoting the visibility of an article for awhile may be just the boost it needs and a unique coloring fill can alert the eye to which articles have been so adjusted and their history can be checked on the daily sort worksheet to see if progress has been made or not there is a macro n for inputting relateds to an article on this worksheet the actual updating of the article with relateds in wikihow has to be

wikihow articles in their related wikihow sections by editing those sections typically because you want to freshen up their image for the user in one way i e you have written new articles since you wrote the old ones and the new articles are related in such a case where the old article is down the list a ways you will probably want to hide the rows in between the old article and row 9 so that you can reach it faster once the macro and you find the right vertical article in row 1 to update the macro n does not do this for you but because it s all in a convenient column and the links are live it s a simple matter to click on a link edit in the ready to be a related new article s column a format copied from cell a10 and then put a 1 in column j to the right of the old article whose row you re updating below and whose link is now conveniently a new distinct color also be warned that about the first thing that macro n does is to delete the first entry so be sure to place your entries in to a167 and not a166 if the macro does not work right on the first try look at the cell range a166 e166 and see what s in it if it s an article it s about to get deleted if it s empty it needs the x s and formulas then try the macro again and it should work fine sometimes perhaps you forgot you have to press command v to paste into the macro s inputbox the article name the macro just copied at cell b166 you might think you re supposed to type in the name of the article but that would have been way too time consuming that way you needn t insert a new category type within the bounds of the variable definition to have it be included but at the same time it s nice to have the section copyable between the cat analysis ws and the daily sort ws you can sort the columns left to right if and when you put in the type 2 category decimal numbers in row 2 above the concatenations how you choose to sort your data is entirely up to you there is nothing in column b seen is in cell d292 the second part starts on row 307 thus 0 01 is in cell c307 and mathematics is in cell e307 some of type two categories are copyable from the seen categories so for example enter totals into cell o302 for microsoft excel and into cell o307 for mathematics and enter totals into cell p294 for msxl imagery and into p307 for mathematics continue this way across to the right until complete edit the formula in k309 to be sum k307 k328 and surround it in format cells border black outline boldest create a dummy macro assuming you have enabled developer in excel preferences on the ribbon or otherwise by recording a tiny macro and then copying this macro code over it you may find it useful to split it up into 3 modules or perhaps not that is what is indicated in the top section of article views and other by mod n etc you create a new module using the visual basic editor each sub to end sub procedure must be separated by a blank line and not have any crapola between subprocedures comments effected with preceding apostrophes may go in at the beginning middle or end of cod or after lines after a space to continue a line of code use space underline then probably indent the next line watch for where this has already been done for you however please it transfers f16 f161 to b16 b161 because the new data from wikihow will presumably have larger views to report per article and we want to subtract yesterday s from today s that we re about to bring in so first we have to transfer what was today to yesterday the result of the subtraction in column a since the totals are views to date will be just today s results next use the links in c3 and c2 to daily access the wikihow data you transfer in the wikihow data as explained above by selecting in the chris garthwaite data from this article downwards the article title and views and copy it and paste it into c17 then do the same for xhohx s 100 articles but below the data you just pasted in for chris the later id next daily post from the wikihow pages the summary of the total article views to cells a4 and a5 and possibly subsequently written line item article views as a negative sum to a3 reconcile the totals next daily run macro02 transfertodaytodailysort t by pressing command option alt t only after the wikihow data has been transferred in running the macro repeatedly will cause duplication in the columns of daily sort which can be cleared and the dates pasted back in and edited to be correct and the nexter defined variable name reset to be the correct following day in row 1 to the right of today s correct update

often get crowded and busy during graduation weekends invite your friends and family college graduation is a special occasion and you want to ensure that you are not leaving anyone out set the mood for your graduation party for college graduation parties extravagant decorations or planned activities are not usually necessary serve party food and beverages a good party isn t complete without plenty to eat and drink set up a board games table play interactive games these games like charades will be a little more lively set up a diy photo booth this is a great way to remember your high school graduation party give a graduation party toast this can be a great way to honor the graduate and celebrate their great accomplishment consider having your party a few weeks after graduation as many people choose to take trips or go on vacation directly after graduation day have your party during june or july as many of your friends will start to leave in august and move into college campuses plan to have your party on a weekend day between 12p m and 6p m as this is when most of your guests will be able to come when picking the date for your party don t forget to take into account large events of other family members you plan to invite for example if someone you know has a wedding in the summer be sure to schedule your party during a different weekend this can be a great way to save money and create a fun lively atmosphere ask a few of your good friends if they d like to combine their graduation party with yours combined parties work well for high school graduations as all graduates have achieved the same goal and have graduated at the same time keep in mind however that you may not be able to invite as many extended family members to a combined graduation party you want to make sure that you have enough space to host all of your guests many people choose to host graduation parties at their homes you can have an indoor party or set up tables and chairs outside for a festive summer bash this is the least expensive option so take into account how much money you re willing to spend on a party if you don t want to have your party at someone s house consider public party venues like restaurants hotels country clubs beaches pools campgrounds or parks you want to invite your friends some of your extended family and teachers or coaches who you really appreciate decide whether you want to send out paper invitations or invitations through email or facebook you can also send some paper invitations to family and use a facebook event to invite your friends to your party you can find many printable invitations online with a paper invitation you can add a copy of your senior picture as a keepsake for family members if you do use a facebook event make sure that you set it to private so you don t unintentionally invite too many people include all the basic information for your party when where and how to rsvp make it clear in your invitation whether or not it s okay for your guests to bring other people with them as well though it s traditional for graduation parties don t feel obligated to use your high school colors as the central theme a few possible themes include tropical hawaiian this is great for an outdoor party you can light tiki torches serve fruit punch put grass skirts around tables and play beach music last chance to be a kid this is a great way to let loose and let everyone have a bit of kid fun invite your guests to bring water guns fill up water balloons and have an outdoor water fight followed by a barbeque in addition to a main meal serve a variety of finger foods and snacks throughout the party you can have the party catered make your own food or have a mix of homemade and catered foods think of dishes you can make ahead of time like casseroles and cold salads allow guests to assemble their foods choose dishes like tacos spaghetti chili burgers and hotdogs salads or sandwiches that guests can make how they like them just have a table set up buffet style consider making or buying a cake that says congrats for the graduate in addition to cake you might want other desserts like an ice cream sundae bar cookies or bowls of candy to take the pressure off of cooking think about making your graduation party a potluck party ask each guest to bring one dish with them this can be fun and it helps make the party less expensive for you start with a banner that says congrats grads add balloons and streamers in your high school colors or in a color that matches the theme of your party consider make a memory jar and placing pencils and slips of paper beside it ask each of your guests to write down one memory they have with you from high school add a bit of nostalgia a high school graduation party is an ideal place to reminisce about past life events display pictures from throughout the years if you re throwing a graduation party for multiple graduates it can be fun to have a baby photo guessing game tack up photos of each graduate as a small child and have each guest try to decide who is who before you begin to plan your graduation party you ll want to pick a date unlike a high school graduation party most college graduates plan parties around the graduation weekend as many people leave soon after consider the time of your graduation for example if you have an afternoon or morning graduation ceremony you may be able to have your graduation party on the night of your actual graduation however this may be more difficult if you have a late afternoon or evening graduation ceremony know your close friends graduation times in college different schools and majors graduate on different days or at different times if you want to invite your significant other or close friends to your party make sure to plan around their graduations as well as yours if you can have your graduation party at your house or apartment this is often the best and least expensive venue option other options for college graduation party venues include local bars restaurants or parks if you do plan to book a venue make sure you do so well in advance several months if possible many graduates will be competing for reservations during the same weekends make sure to invite all of your family who are coming to the graduation ceremony consider throwing your graduation party with some of your closest friends that way you can all celebrate with your families together decide whether you want to use paper or electronic invitations because graduation ceremony invitations are often on paper it can be simple to use electronic invitations for your graduation party if you do use electronic invitations consider setting up an online way that your family and friends can send monetary graduation gifts to the graduate even though guests usually send money upon receiving a formal graduation ceremony invitation this can be a nice way to reach out to more extended family crowd funding sites are a great way to do this simply include a link in your electronic invitations this is only appropriate if you are throwing the party for a graduate other than yourself as it may be perceived as rude to ask for money for yourself just add a few things to make the occasion seem festive consider including a board filled with photographs from the graduate s college experience hang balloons or streamers in the college s colors make a playlist for the party include fun upbeat songs attach your music playing device to speakers and let it play throughout the party music adds festivity to your celebration without being obtrusive keep it simple and serve snack foods and finger foods if you plan to have a meal either have it catered or make it something guests can assemble like a taco bar or grilled hotdogs and hamburgers serve drinks or tell guests that the party is byob at a graduation party you want to make sure you have plenty of different activities to entertain your guests even if you are hosting an outdoor graduation party having an indoor board games table can be a great way to give your guests an option to cool off inside create a table where you can lay out all of your board games for people to choose from make sure you have plenty of chairs for guests to sit in offer a variety of games choose some that can be played with as few as two people board games are an easy activity to set up and they will provide plenty of entertainment to your party guests without requiring you to facilitate you can play games in pairs or teams set up a large pad of paper have guests play pictionary come up with your own clues these can be random or you can relate them back to graduation if you are outdoors you can play games like twister and cornhole guests will enjoy playing with props and taking silly pictures and they ll have a memento from the occasion use a large piece of paper or a sheet as a backdrop against a wall this can be plain or patterned add a banner that has the name of the graduate s school and the year use poster board to create props like speech bubbles giant mustaches and hats for party guests to hold up as they snap photos together on their phones the person who gives the speech or toast should be someone who knows the graduate well either a family member or good friend make sure to speak to the specific strengths and accomplishments of the graduate and wish them luck in the future use quotes to make your speak more elegant toast with champagne or sparkling juice

offer you a bigger and better car because all the compacts are taken when you call for a rental car try saying something like i d like to reserve a compact car for our honeymoon i am trying to make every aspect of our honeymoon extra special do you offer any sort of perks or incentives for special occasions like honeymoons although you re officially on vacation it s important to dress appropriately and to look presentable what you wear should be dependent on what upgrades you are hoping for for example don t show up in pajamas if you want to qualify for first class seats on the airplane or get ushered into the honeymoon suite at a fancy hotel people love to see other people happy and in love if you re squabbling at dinner arguing about luggage tags in the airport check in line or looking generally unimpressed with each other you re less likely to catch anyone s favor for upgrades show off your wedded bliss by showing lots of affection to one another smiling lots holding hands and laughing although it s not standard for companies to ask for proof of marriage for honeymoon upgrades it can t hurt to bring along a copy of your marriage license or certificate just in case if you have flexible honeymoon plans pay attention to over sold announcements at the airport airlines will often reward you with free flights and travel vouchers if you re willing to give up your scheduled seats and wait for the next plane some of the best upgrades are available at the last minute as you start your honeymoon be sure to mention it whenever you encounter staff and ask what upgrades might be available when you arrive at the airport mention your honeymoon at the ticket counter the check in counter and to the on board stewardess once you re seated if you time your boarding with the pilot crew you may even be able let them know too if you or your partner feel shy about mentioning it all the time try dressing up in bride and groom or honeymoon shirts so that it s easy for others to notice and hopefully take initiative it s okay to ask for or suggest upgrades for your honeymoon but don t insist pester or expect them sometimes it s just not possible for staff to accommodate upgrade requests and it s important to trust that they are doing everything they can to make your experience memorable even if you are denied the upgrades you want be sure to say thank you gather small items or leftover wedding favors that you can give to flight attendants hotel staff cab drivers and other staff as celebration favors for your honeymoon the gifts will make them feel included in your celebration and potentially entice them to provide perks and upgrades gift ideas include small boxes of chocolates small scented candles luxury soaps or unique spice packs these small gifts should not be given in lieu of cash tips for restaurant servers tour guides taxi cabs and other ways monetary tips are standard for service everyone loves free upgrades and a honeymoon is a good excuse for them most companies are immune from extra costs that accompany upgrades and incentives but the staff that help facilitate them still have to put forth the extra effort it s important to tip the staff that go out of their way to help make your honeymoon special flight staff can lose their jobs if they accept tips so instead of money bring chocolates or small gifts as a token of your appreciation

you can apply for citizenship since canada and the us are neighbors and have benefited from each other in various ways it has lead many people to believe dual citizenship is easy to obtain however this is not the case if you are not citizen of the us and you were not born in the us or have parents born in the us you will need to apply for a green card in order to qualify as a permanent resident of the us permanent residency is crucial to be eligible to apply for us citizenship green cards allow non us citizens to live in the us on a permanent basis you can qualify for a green card in three

or calculation errors 1 if a billing error is alleged to have occurred a response to those allegations is most often made by the credit card issuer and or the merchant if you are a credit card issuer and you receive notice of a billing error you are required to respond promptly under federal and state law if you are a merchant you will see billing errors in the form of chargebacks a chargeback occurs when a credit card issuer returns a transaction to your bank i e your acquirer 2 as a merchant you will have to follow the credit card issuer s chargeback procedures in order to retain your transaction funds responding as an issuer responding as a merchant preventing chargebacks as a merchant analyze the billing error notice correct the error or acknowledge receipt of the notice decide whether an error occurred fix the error explain your reasons for denying the claim dispute withheld payments understand the credit card process consider common reasons for chargebacks answer copy requests accept the chargeback resubmit the transaction to your acquirer submit to arbitration pay chargeback fees be clear about your policies while not required one way to help avoid chargeback claims is to clearly lay out your policies on your sales receipts deposit receipts promptly log transactions carefully keep consumers informed ship merchandise before depositing receipts a billing error claim is started when a consumer notifies you the credit card issuer of an alleged error this notification must be sent to you within 60 days of you giving the consumer their credit card statement the notice will have the consumer s name credit card information and a detailed description of the charge they are disputing when you receive this notice look it over carefully to ensure it complies with your state s or the federal government s billing error law if the consumer s notice contains all of the correct information and is submitted in a timely manner you are required to respond accordingly if after reviewing the notice there is a clear billing error you may choose to simply correct the error this is often the case with punctuation errors e g the comma or decimal is in the wrong place on a consumer s bill that are easily identified and fixed however if you cannot identify a clear billing error you may have to investigate the consumer s claim if you cannot identify a clear billing error on the face of the consumer s notice you need to let the consumer know you will be investigating their claim to acknowledge receipt of a billing error notice write a formal letter to the consumer your letter should contain your official letterhead name title and address in addition your letter should specifically identify the consumer s name contact information and complaint make sure you reference the letter that was sent to you this written acknowledgement must be mailed or given to the consumer within 30 days of receiving the notice if you did not correct the alleged error based solely on the information included in the consumer s notice you will need to investigate the consumer s claims to do so you will need to collect evidence of the disputed transaction in order to determine if the consumer s claims are well founded contact the merchant s i e the person or company that contracts with an acquirer to accept credit card payments at their store acquirer i e the merchant s bank and ask about the particular transaction the acquirer will have to contact the merchant and ask for an accurate copy of their receipt of the transaction the merchant s receipt will be forwarded to you by their acquirer the merchant may also forward other compelling evidence to help their case for example if a consumer claims they never received the product they paid for and therefore they should receive a refund the merchant may submit an email confirmation from a delivery service e g fedex or ups proving that the product was delivered to the consumer s address once you have received all of the evidence you will analyze it and determine whether a billing error occurred be aware that your investigation is required to be reasonable therefore do not simply go through the motions instead ask for all relevant evidence and follow up when necessary if your investigation falls short of the reasonableness standard the consumer may have the ability to successfully dispute your process if a billing error occurred you need to fix the error credit the consumer s account with the appropriate sum of money and mail a correction notice to the consumer these actions need to take place within two complete billing cycles usually 60 days after receiving the consumer s notice if you conclude that no billing error occurred and the charges on the consumer s account were accurate you need to mail a determination letter to the consumer within two complete billing cycles after receiving the consumer s notice your determination letter should explain in detail how your investigation was conducted and why you believe no billing error occurred include a description of who you talked with and the evidence you received explain that after you looked at all the facts the billing error that was alleged did not actually occur this determination letter will be one source of evidence if the consumer appeals your decision for example the consumer might appeal your decision by stating your investigation fell short of the reasonableness standard required by law if this happens you will want to be able to point to your determination letter to show any administrative agency or court that you conducted a thorough search and came to a plausible conclusion if the consumer does not agree with your determination they may continue to withhold the disputed funds from you while consumers have the legal authority to withhold payments in certain situations you also have the legal authority to take certain actions to attempt to retrieve your money for example you can encourage the consumer to resolve the dispute with the merchant directly if this happens you can ask to receive written notice from the merchant of any resolution and correct the errors at that time in addition you can report the amount withheld as disputed with any credit reporting agency however be careful not to report the amount as delinquent unless you are confident the consumer is improperly withholding funds as a merchant you obtain the ability to make credit card transactions through your acquirer i e your bank by paying for merchant services your acquirer in turn contracts with specific credit card issuers so you can accept their credit cards in your system the credit card issuer issues credit cards from specific credit card companies i e visa mastercard american express discover to consumers who use them at your store when a purchase is made at your store you will retain a copy of each credit card receipt to deposit with your acquirer your acquirer will then pass the information along to the credit card issuer who will charge the consumer for their purchase when a consumer is unhappy with a specific credit card transaction they can dispute the charge with their credit card issuer in response the credit card issuer might issue a chargeback to your acquirer which will usually come in the form of a chargeback reason code these codes will indicate to your acquirer the reason for the chargeback common visa chargeback reason codes include reason code 30 services not provided or merchandise not receivedreason code 53 not as described or defective merchandisereason code 62 counterfeit transactionreason code 73 expired cardreason code 81 83 fraud if a chargeback is issued by a credit card issuer the credit card issuer will send a notice to your acquirer when this happens your acquirer has 30 days to send a copy of the transaction receipt back to the credit card issuer if the acquirer does not have a copy of the receipt in question it may forward the request to you if this happens the acquirer will tell you exactly how long you have to respond when you receive a copy request you should locate the appropriate receipt make a copy and send it back to your acquirer your acquirer will forward it to the credit card issuer make sure the copy is legible so each party can clearly understand the transaction however you choose to send the copy make sure you keep records proving it was sent and received some credit card issuers might contact you directly for a copy request while you are not obligated to fulfill any verbal request from a credit card issuer you might expedite the process by doing so once the credit card issuer receives the required information for their billing error investigation including your copy of receipts they will make a decision if they conclude a billing error occurred they will issue a chargeback when a chargeback is issued the credit card issuer will send back the disputed transaction to your acquirer along with a valid reason code at this point your acquirer can choose to resolve the chargeback on its own or it can forward the chargeback to you if the chargeback is legitimate you might have to accept it and move forward when you accept a chargeback the money you would have received from the credit card issuer for the disputed transaction will not be received if however you have already received the money from the disputed transaction the chargeback will work to reverse the transaction and you will have to pay the credit card issuer back if you do not agree with the chargeback you can resubmit the transaction to your acquirer your acquirer will have to review the submission and if it agrees with your stance it will re present the chargeback to the credit card issuer when you and your acquirer resubmit and re present a chargeback to the credit card issuer you should make sure you have the evidence to back up your claim remember the credit card issuer has already determined once that the transaction was an error they will not overturn their own decision without clear evidence of a mistake if the credit card issuer agrees with the re presentation of the chargeback your money will be cleared and you will receive the transaction funds if the credit card issuer still does not agree with the transaction between you and the credit card holder the credit card issuer will usually have the option of submitting to arbitration in order to determine who is financially liable for the disputed transaction arbitration is most commonly filed by the credit card issuer with the credit card company for example visa issuers can submit to arbitration directly through visa during arbitration the credit card company e g visa mastercard discover will decide which party is responsible for the transaction the credit card company will review any documentation filed by either party and will make a decision based on that information the credit card company s decision is usually final and it must be followed when you receive a chargeback the credit card issuer and credit card company will charge you fees first the credit card issuer will charge you retrieval fees which are assessed so the credit card issuer can investigate the disputed charge these fees can range from 5 to 15 second if a chargeback is issued by the credit card issuer they will charge you a chargeback fee which usually ranges from 15 to 40 if you work with visa or mastercard they have strict limits on how many chargebacks you can incur before you have to take part in chargeback monitoring programs these programs will usually be coupled with fines that can reach 5 000 these policies should be pre printed near the customer signature line make sure the policy is legible on every copy of the receipt these policies will help you make your case to the credit card issuer should a chargeback claim arise for example if you do not allow refunds after 30 days state no refunds after 30 days in this scenario if a credit card issuer starts a chargeback claim because a consumer said they were charged for an item they bought and returned 40 days later you would have evidence that no refund should be given and no chargeback should be initiated due to the clear policy statement on the consumer s receipt as a merchant you are required to deposit your sales and credit receipts with your acquirer within a specified period of time for example visa requires you to process every transaction within 180 days of it occurring however these time limits may change based on certain factors and most merchant agreements require you to make receipt deposits within one to five days of the transaction if deposits are not made in a timely manner it can result in late presentment chargebacks i e visa reason code 74 which occur when you fail to deposit receipts within the required time frame failure to deposit receipts with your acquirer can cause you to lose money and negatively affect customer service make sure that incorrect transactions are properly voided and every consumer is only charged once for their purchase if transactions are entered into the system more than once or you deposit both your copy and the bank copy of a transaction receipt or you deposit the same transaction with multiple acquirers you can cause the consumer to be charged multiple times for their purchase if this happens consumers will likely dispute the multiple charges and the credit card issuer will submit a duplicate processing chargeback i e visa reason code 82 against you if you are delivering items to a consumer keep them up to date regarding any delays in addition let the consumer know when they can expect to have the product at their door when you communicate with your consumers you reduce the likelihood that they will dispute a charge when you deposit a credit card receipt with your acquirer it will relay the information to the consumer s credit card issuer and the consumer will be charged on their credit card if consumers see a charge on their monthly statement before they receive your product or service they might dispute the charge therefore only deposit receipts after you ship the product or provide the service to the purchaser

another option is to look up highly rated hearing aid professionals in your area through an online database you should set up an in person consultation with the hearing aid professional and ask her a

your need for an aid the dispenser can then recommend the best aid for your needs and your budget you may want to set up consultations with several different hearing aid professionals so you can compare prices and services offered by each professional aim to have consultations with at least two different hearing aid professionals so you can compare and contrast prices the professional should offer you aids from a variety of manufacturers and be willing to walk you through the selection process most hearing aid professionals will charge flat one rate for testing fitting and recommending a hearing aid though some dispensers may charge you separately for testing and fitting the dispenser should also show you how to use your aid and provide services for follow up care and any needed adjustments you should also receive oral and written instructions on how to insert your aid and care for it the professional should first ask you a series of open ended questions about your hearing loss issues and your hearing aid needs try to answer her as honestly as possible as this will help her to determine the best hearing aid type for you she may ask you how your hearing loss affects your everyday life and where or when you notice the most difficulty with your hearing she may also ask you if you are comfortable handling aids and dealing with batteries finally she may ask you other questions about your medical history such as a family history of hearing problems any medications you are taking and any prior experience you may have with hearing aids if you have not already had your hearing tested by an audiologist or a hearing specialist you should allow the dispenser to test your hearing the dispenser will then use the results of the test to help you select a hearing aid during the test you will sit in a sound controlled booth and wear earphones you will then need to push a button or raise your hand when you hear a tone or a word the dispenser may test your ability to hear certain tones and noises your ability to hear certain speech patterns and your ability to recognize words at different sound levels the test results will then be recorded on an audiogram if you have perfect hearing your audiogram would show a fairly straight line across the top of the graph if you have hearing loss or hearing issues the line may slope downward be wary of any dispensers who offer free hearing tests the cost of the free test may actually show up later wrapped into the price of the hearing aid there should be no hidden strings attached to a free test once you have outlined your hearing aid needs with the dispenser the dispenser should go over your options keep in mind that hearing aid manufacturers do not set retail prices hearing care professionals set them this means you may find the same hearing aid from a different dispenser at a lower price or at a more expensive price you should discuss your budget with the dispenser and try to get the best price possible for a model or type of hearing aid you are interested in you should ask the dispenser what exactly is included in the quoted price and have her break down exactly what you are paying for the full cost could include testing evaluation fitting and follow up care as well as the actual hearing aid you should have a good idea of what exactly you are paying for when you settle up with the hearing aid professional and be wary of any hearing aid professionals who do not want to break down your total bill for you if you are looking for the best price on a certain model or type of hearing aid you can shop around and get second or third opinions from different hearing aid professionals you should get a copy of your audiogram and use it during consultations with different hearing aid professionals if a different hearing aid professional would like to test your hearing you should not pay to get them tested a second time you can either show the professional your audiogram or insist you be tested again at no charge your second or third opinion hearing professionals may suggest a different model or type of hearing aid they may also offer you a better price on the hearing aid or give you a better deal on hearing aid package which could include maintenance and support services for your hearing aid don t be afraid to compare prices and select the professional that offers you the best option as a consumer you can do some research on your own to compare hearing aid prices if you have access to the internet you may do an online search for certain hearing aid types or brands you may be able to read online reviews of the hearing aids and determine how much the hearing aids retail for this information can then come in handy when you meet with a hearing aid professional and buy a hearing aid from them as you will be well informed and less likely to get sucked in by inflated pricing for example maybe you are interested a behind the ear hearing aid you can look up behind the ear hearing aids and note the price range of these types of hearing aids usually 1 850 2 700 you can also buy a hearing aid online through an online retailer which can be a cheaper option however you should make sure the hearing aid comes with a trial period where you can try out the hearing aid to see if it is right for you you may need to try several hearing aids to find one that fits your ear comfortably and fits your hearing needs you should also search for consumer reports on certain hearing aid brands to determine if they are well reviewed and well priced a list of the top 10 most reviewed hearing aids can be found online for example maybe you come across a certain hearing aid brand such as miracle ear that makes a certain type of hearing aid at a reasonable price you should read the reviews for the hearing aid type to confirm it has mostly positive reviews this could then increase the likelihood that you will also have a positive experience with the brand s hearing aid shop around before you settle on a certain online retailer as you may be able to find the same hearing aid at a better price from a different retailer do a search for a specific model or type of hearing aid and compare the prices on different sites this will help you find the best price for the hearing aid make sure the online retailers appear reputable and legitimate you should avoid any online retailers who appear spammy or full of advertisements for other medical items most reputable online retailers will only sell hearing aids and offer a warranty as part of the online sale before you buy a hearing aid from an online retailer or a hearing aid professional in person you should get a written contract the contract should note everything promised during the consultation in writing this will ensure you have physical documentation of the agreement in the event of an issue or problem with the hearing aid the agreement should include the name of the dispenser the state registration number and the registration expiration the manufacturer s name and model the serial number on the hearing aid and the manufacture date a breakdown of the price for the hearing aid as well as any other charges and services the length of the trial period for the hearing aid any nonrefundable costs such as testing and fitting costs the repair policy including repair costs and any restrictions relating to repair of the hearing aid insurance policy options the procedures if the aid malfunctions or fails to work properly a warranty is a document that covers certain issues or problems with the hearing aid within a certain time period usually one to three years ask the dispenser about your warranty options and make sure online retailers also offer warranties you may also be able to purchase an extended warranty that kicks in after the manufacturer s warranty has expired you should ask several questions about your warranty options including how long does the warranty cover your aid this is usually one to three years does the warranty over all parts fittings and adjustments does the warranty provide you with a new aid if an unforeseen incident damages the aid in any way for example maybe your dog eats it you drop it or you lose it will you get an upgrade in the event of damage to the aid or the same model hearing aids can be quite costly so you should check with medicare about getting insurance coverage for some of the professional services related to the hearing aid such as hearing tests medicare likely will not pay for the hearing aid itself if you are a veteran you may be eligible for hearing aids through the veterans administration you will need to have a documented service that relates to your hearing loss or special needs you may qualify for a disability rate of 10 or more on hearing aids check with your local va office for more information 
query	51	believe scriptures biblically christianity we demolish arguments by casting down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of god and bringing every thought into captivity to believe and obey christ 2 corinthians 10 5 have you ever wondered whether and how you may believe the bible more strongly you have several choices including believing literally literature bible treated as a literature in a religious context religious belief bible treated as having symbolic stories not taken as literal literal belief bible treated as true written word of god literally applied to current life religious belief is often considered to have the same meaning as religion and religion usually deals with both ideas and practices but religious belief can be seen as how one understands the ideas 1 so literal believers of the bible believe it is true about the father god the holy spirit and jesus christ called the living word of god and the son of man son of god so what do jesus the disciples and prophets say about believing the bible scriptures for example all scripture is inspired by god and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives it corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right 2 one decides whether to believe jesus is the living word of god obviously you do not need to know every answer about the bible jesus life ministry death and resurrection to be able to individually believe in the gospel of jesus christ ie the bible according to christianity points to jesus from the very beginning as the living word of god for instance you determine whether you will be personally satisfied by the gospel individually as truth and so accept the bible as accurate as true or not to you personally this article suggests how you might firm up your individual belief in the truth of the bible such belief is called faith steps jesus said he would rise from the dead can you avoid saying i don t know consider building your faith by saying i will strengthen my faith expect ministering spirits angels to help they are ready to protect you and your children if possible if they are believing and living for god are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation pray that you like the original christians would not recant so some were even thrown to the roman lions in the roman arenas as entertainment punishment consider the possibility of dying for your beliefs such as would the early christians have died as martyrs if beliefs were not tested to their individual satisfactions check the biblical evidence glorify god by living out the words of jesus if you believe the writings that indicate this would be a better world if everyone did what jesus said according to the bible seek the spirit of christ be saved as you decide that the word of god is reliable and trustworthy and true in precepts commands and concepts be blessed by living the biblical attitudes that would make you more like jesus which are called the beatitudes and receive many blessings promised by jesus for those who have the right attitudes that hunger and thirst after righteousness and that are poor in spirit humble meek disciplined merciful pure in heart peacemakers and may be persecuted for the name of christ decide whether the bible is prophetically precise about jesus as the messiah check that bible manuscripts and translations to other languages and copies are pure so that they are very highly dependable in detail verify that the bible is archaeologically accurate too as to the sites of the end of times and other sites of israel including the plain of megiddo for armageddon check the dead sea scrolls as a possible verification of the age and accuracy of the old testament tanakh look into questions and access the veracity of jesus resurrection read about a dead man living again as predicted for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption check on this if science can clone a life god can do much more than clone a life decide whether the resurrection happened as reported in the bible examine the evidence read the witness of all the people who saw jesus alive after his crucifixion consider the biblical evidence the tomb was empty though it was guarded by troops of the roman army and realize that jesus appeared in a number of places after his resurrection and showed people his wounds and ate with them study biblically that there were over 500 who saw him read how there is much more to it than just his making a claim read how he was speaking of the temple of his body for which he foretells his resurrection as the son of god by his own power jesus said destroy this temple and i will raise it again in three days he indicated he would permit them to destroy it no one takes it from me but i lay it down of my own accord check the point that jesus walked on water read that he fed 5000 in a crowd by multiplying a few fish determine how much you trust the bible and jesus trust in his resurrection his truth etc investigate the bereans eagerness to study the scriptures every day to find out if what they have been taught about christ is truth according to the scriptures consider what the bible says about upholding a standard and will you raise up a standard of belief and instead say i have faith or i believe if you believed moses you would believe me for he wrote about me but since you do not believe what he wrote how are you going to believe what i say jesus asked and without faith it is impossible to please god because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him but how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard and how will they hear without a teacher but the scriptures offer the promise by faith in jesus christ that might be given to those who believe but is now revealed and made known to all gentiles everywhere so that they too might believe and obey the scriptures of the prophets nan christianity was evidently believed by them as verified well enough to die for that information leads to the doctrine of eternal life through jesus who is called the truth the life and the way the person jesus christ the messiah the anointed son of man and the only begotten son of god are all used to depict jesus consider basing your decision on the fact that jesus is not just a good man or a great prophet according to the new testament when you have done all then stand because of the proof given by this ministry they will glorify god for your obedience to your confession of the gospel of christ and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all that includes deciding that the bible is accurate tanakh the english acronym of the initial letters tnk of the hebrew names for the torah t t r the prophets n n d m and writings k k t b t it is supported by evidence thou wilt show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore god can cause jesus to live his life in the same body based on god as all powerful so that is no problem for him many scientists believe it could indeed happen if they believe in god s existence and as an all powerful being the evidence is there that jesus rose from the dead if he did that is absolutely significant no one else has done that therefore what jesus said would be on a higher order truth that they were honest and were willing to give their lives for that truth that they held dearly you have the facts of what they attested to see whether you believe that the bible is not just symbolic see the symbolic use of it also but the bible is not just good but reliable like infallible verify to your own satisfaction that the bible is textually reliable and that the bible was written by eye witnesses but looking inside yourself to find the best in yourself is not good enough jesus is shown to have backed up his words with what he did jesus foretold his death saying when you have lifted up the son of man then you will know that i am and that i do nothing on my own but speak just what i have heard from my father i have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again he read the hearts purposes of people jesus calmed a storm with a spoken command raised several people from the dead he healed many people what did he say when he was talking about good and bad and what about when he said he would rise from the dead be patient for the lord s coming is near it is the last hour the end of all things is near many anti christs have already appeared yes i am coming soon jesus refuse to accept doubt begin to praise god when negative thoughts may come to mind then replace them with praising god he lives in and through his people who believe him god inhabits the praises of his people ie israel the believers if you really believe him then you will have plenty of praise for him

little of the oil on the wart use hot water and pumice apply tea tree oil try castor oil use aspirin try some betadine iodine put toothpaste on the wart and apply an adhesive bandage use a citrus peel use basil take garlic capsules eat immune system strengthening foods cut up carrots make a fig mask use lemon juice put it in pineapple juice rub daily with the inside of a banana peel bind your wart with a banana peel create a preparation of curcumin use apple cider vinegar use warm water and sea salt mix up baking powder use hot water apply dandelion sap avoid touching warts as much as possible learn the different wart types warts are caused by hpv human papillomavirus and as such can take quite a bit of time to eliminate naturally by one s immune system some warts will disappear over time without treatment however time could mean anywhere from a couple weeks to a couple of years so you may wish to choose a more active method whichever method you choose allow it time to work some methods are faster acting than others the fastest method to removing warts permanently is using 100 tca with this method results are often seen in less than 10 days and are permanent it is also the cheapest and is discussed later it s effectiveness varies and it can take weeks for it work soak the skin in water for 5 minutes or longer apply the acid liberally using the brush and let it dry leave it for a day you can either peel or file it off and then file remaining dead skin do this every two or three days several studies have tried to assess the effectiveness of duct tape in removing warts duct tape occlusion therapy dtot is supposed to localize medication in the general wart area as well as choke the wart itself one study found that duct tape following the application of imiquimod 5 cream was an effective treatment against the common wart however it takes a long time can take up to 6 months and usually people don t see success with this ask your doctor about using cantharidin a fast acting chemical that will burn away the wart unfortunately it can be really expensive upwards of 500 there is some pain involved but you may see results in just a day the doctor applies cantharidin directly on the wart then applies a bandage the next day the bandage is taken off and the dead skin is removed if it doesn t work in one treatment you may need another method your doctor will make appropriate recommendations another remedy your doctor may try is liquid nitrogen or cryotherapy to freeze the wart it may cause some discomfort and can take a few treatments to completely remove a wart but can be very effective if it s not then the wart will usually come back bigger with bigger blood vessels and be almost impossible to remove alternately many drug stores carry otc freeze treatments to zap the wart if using an otc wart freeze treatment keep the following tips in mind follow the direction on the wart removal package your skin should turn from white to red in a matter of minutes and a blister should begin to form underneath the wart small black dots should appear beneath the wart after a few days this is a sign that the treatment is working resist the urge to pull the wart off the wart should fall off on its own if it doesn t treat again after two weeks do not treat a wart that has been unsuccessfully treated three times see a doctor when other methods fail burning the wart off may be what s needed there will be some pain involved and burning can lead to scarring so the best recommendation it to let your doctor handle it however you can try this at home if you re brave enough see your doctor they can use a laser to burn the wart away this is sometimes effective but best recommended after other methods have failed try it at home light a match blow it out and while the match head is still hot touch it to the wart this causes blistering that initiates a healing response peel the layer of infected skin off and cover with aloe and a strip bandage repeat as necessary try this at your own risk very dangerous when in doubt have your doctor remove the wart by cutting it out surgically this is something best left to a doctor to prevent infection and so that a local anesthetic can be used to mitigate the pain a doctor will either do this by electrosurgery and curettage this is where the doctor burns the wart with an electrical current and cuts it out afterward the wart may still return because the blood vessels are still intact laser surgery this is where the doctor burns the wart with an intense beam of light your doctor will be able to counsel you on this treatment which uses your body s own defenses to attack the wart this is a new medication that is used to treat genital warts as well as other warts this is a topical cream that is used to treat some types of warts and skin cancers by stimulating an immune response it does not cure warts but it may help in concert with other treatments ask your doctor for guidance ice the wart then sterilize a needle and poke deep into the wart several times taking care to penetrate every layer of skin in the wart by introducing the virus to your bloodstream you help your body see the wart and fight against it which can lead to its disappearance from your body this method is very effective for some people especially for those with several warts as even the poking of one wart on your body can help your body discover the others and destroy them apply it to the wart and then cover it with a bandage leave it on for the day then at night let it breathe take off bandage cover it with an adhesive bandage remove the bandage at night to let it breathe then start over with the oil in the morning repeat three times a day soak the wart in hot water until it softens scrape it down with a piece of coarse exfoliating pumice until you reach level with the skin take bleach on a cotton swab and hold it against the wart for 15 minutes this may sting a bit you must wash the area well after applying bleach dab a little on the wart and cover with a strip bandage do this for up to three weeks the acid in castor oil irritates the wart and works best on small flat warts on the face and back of hands apply castor oil to the wart with a cotton swab twice a day take a few aspirins and crunch them up adding a few drops of water take the mixture and put it onto the effected wart areas then apply an adhesive bandage leave on overnight aspirin is the ingestible form of salicylic acid but much cheaper than most commercial lotions also called iodine apply the betadine to the wart and cover with a bandage and leave for one or two days then refresh bandage leave for a day and repeat until the wart is gone cut a section of lemon or lime peel slightly larger than the wart and tape it over with an adhesive bandage or tape refresh the peel every day or so and keep the wart covered for as long as possible after about a week or so the entire wart will come out completely tape crushed fresh basil to your wart using waterproof first aid tape do this daily for up to a week the virus killing compound in the basil leaf will kill your wart do this twice a day for at least several weeks warts should start peeling off in one or two weeks but take the garlic until the wart disappears you can also cover the wart with garlic oil once or twice daily for a month

fresh chopped onions do this for 30 minutes once a day for two to three weeks soak your wart in pineapple juice it has a dissolving enzyme the potassium may help speed the disappearance of the wart cut out a section of the peel so it s slightly smaller than the tape you ll be using rub the inside of a banana peel onto the wart and then secure with duct tape keep it on the wart for a day before removing repeat until wart is fully removed curcumin is a turmeric extract that can be found in health food stores combine curcumin papaya extract papain it may have to be purchased in pill form and crushed into powder and vitamin e oil dab the wart and surrounding area with alcoholic extract of golden seal this will stimulate local immune activity take a sharp needle or pin and dip it into the curcumin paste press the needle as deep into the wart as possible continue injecting more of the paste into the wart poking several holes if necessary spread the remaining paste over the wart area and cover with medical tape this technique is effective against flat warts which are found on the face and hands flat warts are notoriously stubborn and will often remain on the skin after the body has acquired resistance to the virus this will finish the warts off in lieu of freezing take a cotton ball only enough to cover the wart and soak it in the vinegar secure with a band aid overnight keep in mind that this might be very painful change the cotton pad daily and keep it on every night if you can after one week the body of the wart will start to peel off and you can gently scrape it away to reveal healthy flesh beneath let the area heal once this is done soak the wart for 10 to 15 minutes in warm salt water to moisten the skin scrape the dead skin layers off the wart using a nail file pumice stone or mild sandpaper you could also use your fingers but wash them thoroughly before and after as warts can easily spread moisten the wart and apply a large flake of sea salt to it put a band aid or tape over the wart to hold the salt in place and observe for several days replacing it after you shower or if it falls off mix baking powder and castor oil into a paste then apply it to the wart at night by covering it with a bandage remove the bandage the next morning repeat as necessary soaking plantar warts in very hot water is helpful because it softens the wart and may kill the virus make sure the water is not hot enough to cause burns keep it under 140 f 60 c pick a fresh dandelion and break the stem apply the milky sap that oozes from the stem onto the wart repeat this three or four times a day scrape the wart with pumice to remove dead layers of skin continue doing this until the wart fades away warts are small growths on the body and are caused by the human

your own inventory form will make this form easier to complete and will also help the adjuster determine the costs to repair the damage to your home and belongings is there evidence of broken or cracked basement or foundation walls are there broken pilings shifted stairs or slanted floors or walls any of these things could mean that the foundation floors or walls will have to be totally rebuilt get organized with a recovery plan a recovery plan is simply a list of jobs that need to be done planning can help you save time and money to develop a recovery plan follow these steps make sure it is safe to work in your home decide what repair work you can and can t do decide if you need financial assistance check with your mortgage holder think before you use credit cards keep talking openly with your family about what s happening and where things are headed voluntary agencies businesses insurance and government disaster programs can help you through recovery private voluntary agencies such as the american or other country red cross salvation army non profit organizations and church or charity groups are usually on the scene during or right after a flood these groups provide for immediate needs such as clothing groceries shelter medical aid and counseling your local tv radio and newspapers will usually publicize how businesses are contributing to the recovery process some businesses may offer reduced prices but be wary of flood sales that are selling flood damaged items if the flooding was widespread and caused a lot of damage your community might be eligible for state provincial or federal aid if the flood is severe enough for your area to be declared a disaster area by the federal or national government funds will often be freed up to assist victims each country has different processes in place so look online for the relevant government department or contact your local representative in the united states the federal emergency management agency may open tele registration which provides a toll free number for you to call to request assistance or it may open one or more disaster application centers this program may provide a safe place to live until repairs to damaged homes are completed home and business owners farmers and others with real or personal property losses may be eligible for low interest loans this program may provide funds for necessary expenses and serious needs if a federal disaster declaration was made you might quality to file an amended tax return for the past year and get a partial refund for your uninsured casualty losses note that many programs now encourage flood proofing that is modifying the structure to help it withstand damage from the next flood a variety of programs give advice on recovering from a disaster these include help with unemployment food stamps income taxes insurance claims legal issues veterans benefits and crisis counseling everything will dry more quickly and clean more easily if you can reduce the humidity in the home if the humidity outside is lower than indoors and if the weather permits open all the doors and windows open closet and cabinet doors and remove drawers to allow air circulation use fans to help move the air and dry out your home do not use central air conditioning or the furnace blower if the ducts were under water if there is a way to run the fan in reverse run it venting to the outside to dry out the ducts run dehumidifiers to draw out moisture dehumidifiers and window air conditioners will reduce the humidity especially in closed up areas desiccants materials that absorb moisture are very useful in drying closets or other enclosed areas where air cannot move through you have three types of contents that should go to three different places move items you want to save to a safe dry place such as the second story or outside put things you don t want to save outside to dry until the adjuster comes to confirm your losses get rid of food and anything else that could spoil or go bad immediately how you drain and dry your ceilings and walls depends on what they are made of gypsum wallboard becomes very soft when wet it will be fragile and will lose any shape or strength when it dries gypsum drywall and sheetrock will have to be ripped out plaster will survive a flood better than wallboard it should not have to be replaced but it will take a very long time to dry there are three main types of insulation and each reacts differently to flood waters styrofoam survives best it may only need to be hosed off fiberglass batts should be discarded if they re muddy cellulose loose or blown in treated paper insulation will hold water for a long time it can also lose its anti fungal and fire retardant abilities therefore flooded cellulose insulation should be replaced if wood is allowed to dry naturally it will generally regain its original shape with some exceptions such as laminated wood check for sagging ceilings drain them carefully start by making a hole near the edge of the sag a and work in toward the center to check for water take off the baseboard stick an awl or knife into the wall about 2 inches 5cm above the floor just above the 2 x 4 wood sill plate if water drips out cut or drill a hole large enough to allow water to drain freely depending on the spacing between studs in your walls make a hole every 16 40 6cm or every 24 60 9cm that wall will have to be ripped out if the gas has been turned off at the main valve serving your home you need to have a professional restore gas service to your home relight pilot lights and do a final check of the system check your oil pump if it got wet have the pump professionally checked and cleaned after you ve turned the electricity back on open the main valve and turn the pump on look carefully for any signs of leaking oil if you see any call a professional propane lp gas and butane systems are kept in pressurized tanks so there is no electric pump to turn on but there are check valves and emergency shut off valves check the tanks for signs of movement or floating then follow the instructions above for gas systems many local codes require that a licensed electrician do the work or that a municipal inspector check the system before you can turn the power back on public water suppliers usually provide water soon after the flood if you re unsure of your water supply only use it to hose your home or for sanitation purposes such as flushing the toilet private wells should be pumped until the water is clear you can decide whether water is clear enough to hose your home and do other cleaning work check with the local health department for instructions before you drink or cook with your well water check your water heater if flood waters got into the gas burner electrical parts or insulation it should be replaced if you want to save it have it cleaned and restarted by a professional public sewers should work soon after a flood but mud and debris might clog them flush the toilet before you use it if it s clogged check with your local sewer department septic systems won t work until the ground water level is below the distribution lines so be careful about flushing the toilet and pouring things down the drain they may not have anywhere to go the red cross or similar organizations will often distribute cleanup kits after a disaster these contain many useful items such as a broom mop bucket and cleaning supplies in most cases household cleaning products will do the job if you use them correctly check the label on the products to see how much to use after cleaning a room or item go over it again with a disinfectant to kill the germs and smell left by the flood waters a two bucket approach is most efficient use one bucket for rinse water and the other for the cleaner rinse out your sponge mop or cleaning cloth in the rinse bucket start cleaning a wall at the bottom or where the worst damage was if you have removed the wallboard or plaster wash the studs and sills and disinfect them if you taped your windows before the storm clean the tape off as soon as possible the sun will bake the adhesive into the glass use orange or eucalyptus oil to help remove the sticky leftovers don t try to force open swollen wooden doors and drawers take off the back of the piece of furniture to let the air circulate you ll probably be able to open the drawers after they dry there s an unexpected danger of shock with some electrical appliances such as tv sets and radios certain internal parts store electricity even when the appliance is unplugged check the back for a warning label even if your washing machine did not get wet do not use it until you know that the water is safe enough to drink and that your sewer line works throw out soft plastic and porous items that probably absorbed whatever the flood waters carried in like the washing machine the dishwasher should also be used only after you know your water is safe to drink and your sewer line works even food in tin cans should be discarded if the cans got wet during the flood because there is no way to be absolutely certain the food inside is safe do not keep food in bottles or jars with bottle caps or screw on lids they do not keep out flood waters valuable papers such as books photographs and stamp collections can be restored with a great deal of effort they can be rinsed and frozen in a frost free freezer or commercial meat locker until you have time to work on them as you get rid of things from your home don t turn your yard into a dump food and garbage must be hauled away as soon as possible mosquitoes can carry many diseases and a flood can create ideal conditions for them to breed drain or remove standing water that can become a breeding ground dump water out of barrels old tires and cans check that your gutters are clean and can drain ditches and drains also need to be cleaned so they can carry storm water away from your home lawns usually survive being underwater for up to four days salt water should be hosed off the lawn and shrubs flood proofing means to remodel or rebuild using materials and methods that will prevent or minimize damage from future floods there are five types of flood proofing most buildings can be raised so that the lowest floor is above the possible flood level moving a building out of the flood prone area is the surest way to protect it from flood damage flood walls berms and levees all work to keep flood waters from reaching your house dry floodproofing means sealing a building to keep flood waters out wet floodproofing means modifying a building so that flood waters will cause only minimal damage to the building and contents once you ve determined the repairs and flood proofing measures you are going to take local codes generally require that you get a building permit before you make repairs or alterations to your home or property make sure your plans are reviewed and approved by your building department many problems result from rebuilding too quickly after a flood before everything dries if you re going to replace a flooded furnace water heater or air conditioner install the new one on a higher floor if your new air conditioner or heat pump will be outside install it on a platform above the flood protection level wash and disinfect the studs and sills if the wallboard and insulation had to be removed if you are going to rebuild the walls remember that metal studs and sills are not damaged by water as much as wooden ones think horizontal rather than vertical install the wallboard panels sideways so they are only four feet high if the next flood is less than four feet deep you only have to replace half the wall do not paint until the surface is completely dry if the surface still contains moisture the paint will peel things look dry on the surface long before they are dry on the inside and this can lead to costly mistakes some floors are made with particle board or plywood materials that fall apart when wet for long do not lay new flooring or carpet until the sub flooring is completely dry floor joists and some wood floors will regain their shapes if allowed to dry naturally this is especially valuable to enable you to handle the difficult jobs such as foundation repair and electrical work if you ve been satisfied with work done by licensed local contractors try them first preparing a flood response plan will help you think through all the details that demand attention as the flood waters approach this is a project for the whole family as you write down the plan make sure everyone understands it having the plan in writing will help you remember what to do when everyone is in a hurry and excited because a flood is coming develop a flood response plan based on the flood protection level local warning procedures and the time you will have to respond in flash flood areas you may only have enough time to evacuate but if you live in areas in the path of a hurricane or cyclone or on large rivers you may have 12 24 hours of warning time if you live in a mountainous area or if your flooding comes from a small stream or ditch your home may be subject to flash flooding flash floods can occur before the local emergency managers have time to issue a warning in these cases listen for warnings for example in the united states you can listen to the national weather service which may issue a flash flood watch advising people that conditions are favorable for a flash flood you may not be notified of a flash flood warning before flooding actually begins if you live near the coast you ll be asked to evacuate when a hurricane or cyclone threatens your community it s important to evacuate when you re asked to prepare your flood response plan to take into account all of the time that you ll need to protect your home before you evacuate you ll need time to board your windows and to clear your yard so your belongings won t blow or float away your flood response plan should be a checklist of steps to take before flood waters reach your home the following are examples of things to include listen to local radio or tv stations for flood information and evacuation instructions read safety precautions at the top of this document get into the habit of keeping a full tank of gas in your car especially at times of the year when flooding can be expected in your area pack the car with supplies you need while away from home put supplies needed for clean up and recovery in a safe place if your flood protection level is over your top floor you may have to store supplies at a friend s home away from the flood prone area or take them with you in your car take pets to a kennel or friend s place on high ground health codes do not allow animals in public shelters if you have enough warning time move your contents above the flood protection level or to another safe place in the united states some of the cost of doing this can be covered under an nfip flood insurance policy install flood shields and other flood proofing measures you may have prepared in hurricane or cyclone prone areas protect against wind damage install hurricane shutters or plywood covers over windows and doors take down tv antennas and securely tie down boats garbage cans and everything else left outdoors tape plastic around the cap to your well this will prevent most but not all flood water from entering your water supply you will still have to disinfect your water turn off the electricity gas oil and water lock your home follow your designated evacuation route to a place of shelter 
query	54	read guitar tabs guitarists have their own special system of music notation called guitar tablature or guitar tabs for short using guitar tabs a guitarist can play a wide variety of music without ever having to learn how to read standard sheet music though guitar tabs aren t a perfect way of describing music they ve allowed newer generations of guitarists to quickly and easily share information about how to play songs across the globe via the internet every guitarist should have at least a basic understanding of how to read tablature it s the de facto shorthand for much of the guitar music you ll find written out online using tabs to fret notes and chords reading special symbols reading an example tab view tab notation as a representation of the guitar s strings use the numbers on the tab to fret spaces on the neck play vertically stacked numbers at the same time proceed from left to right look for lyrics or chord changes look for additional symbols in the tab learn the symbol for hammer ons learn the symbol for pull offs learn the symbol for string bends learn the symbols for slide techniques learn the symbols for tremolo bar techniques learn the symbol for vibrato learn the symbols for muting techniques learn the symbol for tapping learn the symbols for harmonic techniques learn the symbol for trills learn the symbol for tremolo picking glance over the tab below start with the chord at the far left proceed to the next two chords play the individual notes at the right put it all together a tab is usually written using six horizontal lines each corresponding with a string on the guitar the bottom line represents the lowest thickest string while the top string represents the highest thinnest string for standard tunings this means that the lines will represent from the bottom up the low e a d g b and high e strings e thinnest string b g d a e thickest string unlike normal musical notation guitar tabs don t tell you which notes to play instead they tell you where to put your fingers numbers on the lines correspond to frets on the fretboard each number represents a specific fret on the line it s written on for instance a 1 on the bottom line means to fret the first fret of the lowest string and play that note if the number is greater than 0 1 2 3 4 etc then press your finger on that fret when you play with 1 being the fret closest to the stock and fret numbers increasing as you move towards the guitar s body if the number is 0 then pluck the open string without fretting any notes when reading tabs many times you ll come across numbers that are aligned vertically these are chords fret every note in the chord as written then play the notes all at the same time you ll get a fuller sound than you might see the chord name written as well see example 2 below tabs are read like sentences in a book read them from left to right across the page dropping down to the next line only when you ve reached the end of the previous play the notes and chords in sequence as you read them from left to right note that most but not all tabs don t display the rhythm with which you should play the notes in the tab they may break the tab into measures usually signified by vertical lines in the tab between measures but they won t tell you the rhythm of the notes within the measures in this case it s best to listen to the song while you read the tab to find the beat some advanced tabs do count out the beat for you this is usually done by including rhythmic markings along the top of the tab notation each marking is vertically aligned with a note or a rest to give a sense of how long the note or rest lasts typical rhythmic markings include w whole note h half note q quarter note e eighth note s sixteenth note sometimes markings are included to show that a note or rest lies on the and of a certain beat a dot after the rhythm marking means the corresponding note or rest is dotted for instance q dotted quarter note for rhythm basics see how to read music many songs have guitar parts made up solely or mostly of chords this is especially true for rhythm guitar parts in this case the tab may forgo typical tab notation in favor of a simplified list of chord changes these chords are almost always written in standard chord notation amin a minor e7 e dominant 7 etc simply play the chords in the order that they re listed if it s not noted otherwise try playing one chord per measure but if the changes don t sound right listen to the song for the strumming pattern sometimes these chord changes are printed above the lyrics of the song to give you a sense of when these chords are played as in this snippet from a tab for the beatles twist and shout a7 d g a well shake it up baby now shake it up baby as you can see in the example above many tabs aren t just collections of lines and notes tabs use a wide variety of special symbols to tell you how to play the notes in the tab most symbols refer to specific playing techniques to make a song sound as much like the recording as possible pay attention to these special markings in a tab an h inserted between two notes e g 7h9 means to perform a hammer on to hammer on play the first note normally then use a finger on your fretting hand to tap down on the second note without using your strumming hand to pluck the note sometimes is used instead e g 7 9 a p inserted between two notes e g 9p7 means to perform a pull off which is essentially the opposite of a hammer on pluck the first note while using another finger to fret the second note then quickly lift the finger fretting the first note the second note will sound as with hammer ons sometimes is used instead e g 9 7 in this case know to perform a pull off if the second note is lower and a hammer on if the second note is higher if a b is inserted between two fret numbers e g 7b9 fret the first note and bend it up until it sounds like the second sometimes the second number is in parentheses and occasionally the b is omitted altogether if there is an r it denotes what the note should be released to e g 7b9r7 perform a basic slide by striking a note moving your finger up or down a string without releasing it from the fretboard then striking another note an ascending slide is marked by a forward slash and a descending slide is marked by a backwards slash e g 7 9 7 a lowercase s usually means to perform a legato slide this is like a normal slide but you only strike the first note with your pick let your target note sound simply from the motion in your fret hand there is debate among guitarists over whether a light pick strike is appropriate for the target note the most important thing is to remember to leave no gap between notes shift slides are signified by an uppercase s in this case strike the target note without striking the initial note of the slide if your guitar has a tremolo bar also known as a whammy bar or vibrato bar follow these symbols to achieve some remarkably out there effects if you see a n where n some number perform a tremolo bar dip quickly hit and release the bar to dip the note s pitch the number between the slashes gives an indication of the pitch you should dip to dip the pitch by n semitones a semitone is the same as the pitch between two adjacent frets for instance 5 means to drop the pitch by 5 semitones which will be the same tone as 5 frets below the original note if you see a n where n some number fret note n then strike it and depress the tremolo bar deeply to dramatically drop the pitch if you see n raise the tremolo bar up after striking note n to raise the pitch on some guitars you can also put your bar in inverted position first so that hitting the bar raises the pitch rather than lowers it if you see n perform a tremolo bar inverted dip by first depressing the tremolo bar then raising it as above this also works in inverted position look for or v if you see these symbols perform vibrato on the preceding note strike the note then use your fretting hand to rapidly bend and unbend the string vibrating the pitch of the note several tab symbols indicate different methods for giving notes a muted sound if you see an x or a dot below the number mute the string lay your fretting hand finger s across the designated strings so that when you strike them they produce a dull clicking sound several x in a row on adjacent strings indicates a rake just mute more than one string at once if you see pm play using palm muting for standard right handed guitar playing gently lay the edge of your right palm across the strings near the guitar s bridge when you strike the notes with the same hand as is providing the mute you should hear the tone of the note but with a subdued dead quality move your hand slightly up the strings toward the neck to deaden the notes more tapping is usually represented by a t if you see a t in a string of notes e g 2h5t12p5p2 use one of the fingers on your picking hand usually your right hand to tap down hard on the indicated fret this is a useful technique for making very rapid fast changes in pitch guitar tabs differentiate between several different techniques for playing harmonics bell like tones created by special fretting techniques for natural harmonics the fret is surrounded by e g 7 if you see this lay a fretting finger across the metal line at the right of the fret not the middle of the fret then strike the string for a clear bell tone pinch harmonics are signified by surrounding the fret number in brackets e g to perform a pinch harmonic strike the note with your pick hand while your pick hand thumb is also touching the note use vibrato from your fret hand to add sustain to the tone pinch harmonics are difficult it requires lots of practice note these are best performed on an electric guitar with distortion using a bridge pickup tapped harmonics are signified by two notes the second enclosed in parentheses e g n n tapped harmonics are like natural harmonics but shifted around the neck fret the first note then use a finger on your pick hand to slap or strike the string at the second fret position when you see a tr written in or above the tab it s usually between or above two notes often it s accompanied by a string of tildes s this simply means to strike the first note then rapidly hammer on to the second note and pull off to the first note again and again tp means you should tremolo pick the note essentially pick the single note over and over as rapidly as you can sometimes a tp symbol is followed by a string of tildes or dashes to give you a sense of how long to tremolo pick notice that it shows several three note chords as well as some individual notes descending on the higher strings in the following steps we ll walk through this tab beat by beat e 3 0 b 3 0 g 7 7 7 2 0 d 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 a 2 5 5 5 7 7 7 e 0 5 5 5 in this case first you would play a power chord in e middle finger finger 2 on the second fret on the a string ring finger finger 3 on the second fret on the d string and no finger on the low e string strumming those first 3 strings e a d once play the chord highlighted with parentheses below e 3 0 b 3 0 g 777 2 0 d 2 777 777 a 2 555 777 e 0 555 the next chord you would play would be a power chord on the fifth fret of a three times so you would play with your index finger on the fifth fret of a your middle finger on the seventh fret of d and your ring finger on the seventh fret of g then simply shift this finger shape down one string so that your index finger is on the fifth fret of the e string with your other fingers on the seventh frets of the a and d strings play the chords in the sequence that they re highlighted with parentheses below e 3 0 b 3 0 g 7 77 2 0 d 2 7 77 777 a 2 5 55

finger on the third fret of the high e string pluck once then play the open high e string and so on through the six descending notes play the notes below in the order they re highlighted in parentheses e 3 0 b 3 0 g 7 7 7 2 0 d 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 a 2 5 5 5 7 7 7 e 0 5 5 5 e 3 0 b 3 0 g 7 7 7 2 0 d 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 a 2 5 5 5 7 7 7 e 0 5 5 5 e 3 0 b 3 0 g 7 7 7 2 0 d 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 a 2 5 5 5 7 7 7

tag to create a hyperlink to any other web page insert the url of the web page to link to using the href attribute here s an example that links to the page you re reading now a href https www wikihow com write an html page visitors to your website can click this text to follow the link a another attribute that just about any html tag can use is the id element inside any tag write id example or use any name that does not include spaces this won t have any visible effect but we ll use it in the next step for example add this to your document p id example this paragraph will be used as an example to show how the id attribute works p now we can use the hyperlink tag a a to link to another spot on the same page instead of a url we ll use the symbol followed by the id value we re linking to for example a href example this text will link to the paragraph with the id example a all html values are case insensitive example and example will link to the same place if your page is short enough to display all at once you might not notice anything happen when you click the link in your browser resize the window until a scroll bar appears then try again the img tag is an empty tag meaning no closing tag is necessary all the information the browser needs to display the image will be added using attributes here s an example that will display the wikihow logo followed by a description of each attribute img src the src attribute tells the browser where to find the image note that it s generally considered rude to display an image from someone else s site and the image will disappear if that site ever goes offline the style attribute can do many things but most importantly it s used to set the width and height of the image in pixels you can instead use the separate width and height attributes but this can lead to weird resizing problems if you are using css the alt attribute is a brief description of the image which the user will see if the image fails to load this is considered a requirement since it s used by screen readers for blind visitors html validation checks for errors in your code if your web page isn t displaying correctly validation can help you find the mistake causing problems it can also teach you more about html by identifying code that looks fine on your display but isn t recommended due to updates in the html standard using invalid html doesn t make your site unusable but it can cause problems or inconsistent display in different browsers try a free online validation service from w3c or search for another html 5 validator online there are many more html tags and attributes and many places to learn them try w3schools and html dog for more tutorials and comprehensive lists of tags find a web page you like the look of and use your browser s

to boost your search engine visibility or using div and span to help with css styling choose a web hosting service and you can upload as many html pages as you like to your personal web domain to do this you ll need to use ftp uploading software but many web hosts provide this service as well when linking to pages or images on your own site you do not need to use the full address for example if your domain name is www superskilledhtmlcoder com then a href journal monday html the text inside these tags a will link to the address www superskilledhtmlcoder com journal monday html if your html page is looking a little bare bones try learning some basic css to add color different fonts and greater control over element placement linking a css stylesheet to the html page lets you make powerful

query	56	create a secure login script in php and mysql nowadays with more and more stories of cracking in the news developers are looking for the best ways of securing their sites if your site has a member system it could be at risk from being cracked and your users data could be compromised this guide will show you one attempt at making a secure login using php the code is as good as we can make it but security and especially encryption are complex subjects that are changing all the time and we can t claim to have the entire field mastered therefore we may have missed a few tricks in our code if we have please let us know and we ll try to incorporate any improvements into what we have writing a login system is a complex topic and not something to be undertaken by those who are not intimately familiar with a wide variety of security topics the login system presented here is to be used for educational purposes not a production environment if you need a login system for a production environment please locate a prepacked and vetted system there are several listed in the warnings section at the end of this article following this guide will help guard against many types of attack that crackers can use to gain control of other users accounts delete accounts and or change data below is a list of possible attacks this guide tries to defend against configure your server configure the mysql database create database connection page create the php functions create processing pages create javascript files create html pages protecting pages install a web server php and mysql on your server create a mysql database create a user with only select update and insert privileges create a mysql table named members the code below creates a table with four fields id username email password create a table to store login attempts create a test row in table members create a global configurations pagecreate a folder called includes in the root directory of the application and then create a new php file in that directory create the database connection pagethis is the php code that we will use to connect to our mysql database securely start a php session create the login function the brute force function check logged in status sanitize url from php selfthis next function sanitizes the output from the php self server variable create the login processing page process login php create a file to process logins called process login php in the application s includes directory create a logout script registration page create sha512 js filethis file is an implementation in javascript of the hashing algorithm sha512 create forms js filethis file which you should create in the js directory of the application will handle the hashing of the passwords for the login formhash and registration regformhash forms function formhash form password create a new element input this will be our hashed password field create the login form index php create the register success php pagecreate a new php web page called register success php in the root directory of the application create the error pagecreate a new html page in the root directory of the application page protection script most web hosting services will have php and mysql already installed you will just have to check they have the most recent versions of php and mysql for this guide to work if they don t have at least php5 3 and mysql5 you might like to ask a few questions about their commitment to security keeping your software up to date is a part of the security process if you have your own server or computer you should install the required software in the normal way for your system generally speaking if you are not going to use the setup for production purposes and you are developing under windows or os x installing an xampp stack is the way to go get the appropriate version for your operating system at https www apachefriends org index htmlbut please note that you should under no circumstances use xampp to create a production server environment for you under linux use your package manager to download and install the necessary packages some distributions like ubuntu package all the necessary applications into one bundle just do the following from a terminal window in ubuntu sudo apt get install lamp server phpmyadminhowever you install the necessary elements please ensure you configure mysql with a secure root password log into your database as an administrative user usually root in this guide we will create a database called secure login see how to create a database in phpmyadmin you can either use the code below or do the same thing in phpmyadmin your favourite gui mysql client if you prefer create database secure login note some hosting services don t allow you to create a database through phpmyadmin learn how to do it in cpanel creating a user with restricted privileges means that if there was ever a breach of security in our script the hacker couldn t delete or drop anything from our database using these privileges you can get by doing pretty much anything you would want to in your application if you are really paranoid create a user for each function of course you will need to be logged into mysql as a user with sufficient privileges in order to create a user this user will usually be root these are the details of the user we created user sec user password ekcgzr59zaa2bewu note it is a good idea to change the password from the one given above when running on your own server make sure if you do this that you also change the code below and your php database connection code in the application we are creating remember it doesn t need to be a password that you can remember so make it as complicated as possible here s a random password generatorgiven below is the sql code for creating the database user and granting it the necessary permissions or you can do this in a gui database client like phpmyadmin if you prefer create user sec user localhost identified by ekcgzr59zaa2bewu grant select insert update on secure login to sec user localhost if you see yourself deleting records from either of the tables in this module you may want to add delete to the list of privileges or you may prefer to create a different user with just the delete privilege and only on the table from which you want to delete records if you don t want to delete from both you do not need to grant delete privileges at all for anything in this example script we use the binary datatype to store the password because it will be encrypted using bcrypt which has an output length of 60 characters to store it more efficiently we store it in the binary format important if you have attempted to use this script with sha512 hashing and had problems with logging in you need to change the password field to char 128 as the original binary 60 cropped out 68 crucial characters at the end of the hashed password this causes the password to mismatch when attempting to login create table secure login members id int not null auto increment primary key username varchar 30 not null email varchar 50 not null password char 128 not null engine innodb as we ve said before you can do this in whatever type of client you prefer we will use this table to store login attempts for a user this is one way in which we will make brute force attacks more difficult create table secure login login attempts user id int 11 not null time varchar 30 not null engine innodb it will be important to be able to test your login script so below is the script to create a user with known details username test useremail test example compassword 6zaxn2vzm9nujt2ythe code you need in order to be able to log in as this user is insert into secure login members values 1 test user test example com 2y 10 irzyji10j3jy k6jzslqtolif1wezqtrqok3dcs3jdnfehl4fwm4g call it psl config php in a production environment you ll probably want to locate this file and all your other include files outside of the web server s document root if you do that and we strongly suggest that you do you will need to alter your include or require statements as necessary so that the application can find the include files locating your include files outside of the web server s document root means that your file cannot be located using a url so if someone mistakenly dropped the php extension say or messed up the file permissions the file still could not be displayed as text in a browser window the file contains global configuration variables things like whether anyone can register whether or not it s a secure https connection and other stuff as well as the database details could also go here php these are the database login details define host localhost the host you want to connect to define user sec user the database username define password ekcgzr59zaa2bewu the database password define database secure login the database name define can register any define default role member define secure false for development only create a new php file called db connect php in the application s includes directory and add the code below you can then include the file onto any page you wish to connect to the database phpinclude once psl config php as functions php is not included mysqli new mysqli host user password database php sessions are known not to be secure therefore it is important not just to put session start at the top of every page on which you want to use php sessions we are going to create a function called sec session start this will start a php session in a secure way you should call this function at the top of any page in which you wish to access a php session variable if you are really concerned about security and the privacy of your cookies have a look at this article create a secure session managment system in php and mysql this function makes your login script a whole lot more secure it stops crackers accessing the session id cookie through javascript for example in an xss attack also the session regenerate id function which regenerates the session id on every page reload helps prevent session hijacking note if you are using https in your login application set the secure variable to true in a production environment it is essential that you use https create a new file called functions php in your application s includes directory and add the following code to it phpinclude once psl config php function sec session start session name sec session id set a custom session name secure secure this stops javascript being able to access the session id httponly true forces sessions to only use cookies if ini set session use only cookies 1 false header location error php err could not initiate a safe session ini set exit gets current cookies params cookieparams session get cookie params session set cookie params cookieparams cookieparams cookieparams secure httponly sets the session name to the one set above session name session name session start start the php session session regenerate id regenerated the session delete the old one this function will check the email and password against the database using the password verify function rather than comparing the strings helps to prevent timing attacks it will return true if there is a match add this function to your functions php file function login email password mysqli using prepared statements means that sql injection is not possible if stmt mysqli prepare select id username password from members where email limit 1 stmt bind param s email bind email to parameter stmt execute execute the prepared query stmt store result get variables from result stmt bind result user id username db password stmt fetch if stmt num rows 1 if the user exists we check if the account is locked from too many login attempts if checkbrute user id mysqli true account is locked send an email to user saying their account is locked return false else check if the password in the database matches the password the user submitted we are using the password verify function to avoid timing attacks if password verify password db password password is correct get the user agent string of the user user browser server xss protection as we might print this value user id preg replace user id session user id xss protection as we might print this value username preg replace username session username session hash sha512 db password user browser login successful return true else password is not correct we record this attempt in the database now time mysqli query insert into login attempts user id time values user id now return false else no user exists return false brute force attacks are when a hacker tries thousands of different passwords on an account either randomly generated passwords or from a dictionary in our script if a user account has more than five failed logins their account is locked brute force attacks are hard to prevent a few ways we can prevent them are using a captcha test locking user accounts and adding a delay on failed logins so the user cannot login for another thirty seconds we strongly recommend using a captcha as yet we have not implemented this functionality in the example code but hope to do so in the near future using secureimage since it does not require registration you may prefer something better known such as recaptcha from google whichever system you decide on we suggest you only display the captcha image after two failed login attempts so as to avoid inconveniencing the user unnecessarily when faced with the problem of brute force attacks most developers simply block the ip address after a certain amount of failed logins but there are many tools to automate the process of making attacks like these and these tools can go through a series of proxies and even change the ip on each request blocking all these ip addresses could mean you re blocking legitimate users as well in our code we ll log failed attempts and lock the user s account after five failed login attempts this should trigger the sending of an email to the user with a reset link but we have not implemented this in our code here is the code for the checkbrute function at the time of writing add it to your functions php code function checkbrute user id mysqli get timestamp of current time now time all login attempts are counted from the past 2 hours valid attempts now 2 60 60 if stmt mysqli prepare select time from login attempts where user id and time valid attempts stmt bind param i user id execute the prepared query stmt execute stmt store result if there have been more than 5 failed logins if stmt num rows 5 return true else return false we do this by checking the user id and the login string session variables the login string session variable has the user s browser information hashed together with the password to check if they are equal we use the hash equals function to prevent timing attacks we use the browser information because it is very unlikely that the user will change their browser mid session doing this helps prevent session hijacking add this function to your functions php file in the includes folder of your application function login check mysqli check if all session variables are set if isset session session session user id session login string session username session get the user agent string of the user user browser server if stmt mysqli prepare select password from members where id limit 1 bind user id to parameter stmt bind param i user id stmt execute execute the prepared query stmt store result if stmt num rows 1 if the user exists get variables from result stmt bind result password stmt fetch login check hash sha512 password user browser if hash equals login check login string logged in return true else not logged in return false else not logged in return false else not logged in return false else not logged in return false it is a modificaton of a function of the same name used by the wordpress content management system function esc url url if url return url url preg replace i url strip array 0d 0a 0d 0a url string url count 1 while count url str replace strip url count url str replace url url htmlentities url url str replace amp 038 url url str replace 039 url if url we re only interested in relative links from serverreturn else return url the trouble with using the server variable unfiltered is that it can be used in a cross site scripting attack most references will simply tell you to filter it using htmlentities however even this appears not to be sufficient hence the belt and braces approach in this function others suggest leaving the action attribute of the form blank or set to a null string doing this though leaves the form open to an iframe clickjacking attack it goes in this directory because it contains no html markup we will use the mysqli set of php functions as this is one of the most up to date mysql extensions phpinclude once db connect php include once functions php sec session start our custom secure way of starting a php session if isset post post email post password post the hashed password if login email password mysqli true login success header location protected page php else login failed header location index php error 1 else the correct post variables were not sent to this page echo invalid request your logout script must start the session destroy it and then redirect to somewhere else note it might be a good idea to add csrf protection here in case someone sends a link hidden in this page somehow for more information about csrf you could visit coding horror the current code for logging out the user which you should add to a file called logout php in the application s includes directory is phpinclude once functions php sec session start unset all session values session array get session parameters params session get cookie params delete the actual cookie setcookie session name time 42000 params params params params destroy session session destroy header location index php the registration code is included in two new files called register php in the application s root directory and register inc php in the includes directory it does the following things obtains and validates the username the user wishes to adoptobtains and validates the user s email addressobtains and validates the password the user wants to usehashes the password and passes it back to the register php page i e it posts to itself most of the validation is done in javascript client side this is because the user has no motivation to circumvent these checks why would a user want to create an account that would be less secure than otherwise we will discuss the javascript in the next section tip error msg can be changed into an array instead of simply making it one long string of errors this is as simple as setting error msg array at the top of the file then replacing every error msg to error msg serialize error msg the serialize turns the array into a single string so the post is able to use it to use this post on the page after registering simply do error variable unserialize post of course you should always use an if isset post error variable unserialize post as this checks if the variable is actually set for now just create the register php file and include the following code in it phpinclude once includes register inc php include once includes functions php doctype html html head meta charset utf 8 title secure login registration form title script type text javascript src js

no post data passed into the form the registration form is displayed the form s submit button calls the javascript function regformhash this function does the necessary validation checks and submits the form when all is well the javascript functions are discussed in the next section if the post data exists some server side checks are done to sanitise and validate it note that these checks are not complete at the time of writing some of the issues are mentioned in the comments in the file at present we just check that the email address is in the correct format that the hashed password is the correct length and that the user is not trying to register an email that has already been registered if everything checks out the new user is registered by writing a new record into the members table we will use the hashing function so our passwords don t get sent in plain text the file can be downloaded from pajhome org uk it is also saved in the github repository store your copy of this file in

by creating and populating a hidden field this is an html form with two text fields named email and password the form s submit button calls the javascript function formhash which will generate a hash of the password and send email and p the hashed password to the server you should create this file in the application s root directory when logging in it is best to use something that is not public for this guide we are using the email as the login id the username can then be used to identify the user if the email is not displayed on any pages within the wider application it adds another unknown for anyone trying to crack the account note even though we have encrypted the password so it is not sent in plain text it is essential that you use the https protocol tls ssl when sending passwords in a production system it cannot be stressed enough that simply hashing the password is not enough a man in the middle attack could be mounted to read the hash being sent and use it to log in phpinclude

query	57	learn english english can be a difficult language to learn but it can be easy if you practice it a lot this wikihow will give you tips for learning english improving your spoken english improving your writing reading and listening skills committing to your new language speak a little english every day work on your pronunciation expand your vocabulary and use idiomatic phrases attend an english class or discussion group carry a dictionary listen to english radio or podcasts watch english movies and tv shows read an english book newspaper or magazine keep a diary in english find an english speaking pen pal stay motivated practice every day train yourself to think in english make friends with english speakers don t be afraid to make mistakes the absolute best way to learn any new language is just to speak it it doesn t matter if you only know five english words or if you re practically fluent speaking english with another person is the fastest most effective method of improving don t wait until you feel more comfortable speaking in english you probably won t reach that level for a long time so push yourself outside of your comfort zone and start speaking english today you ll be amazed at how quickly your language skills improve find a native english speaker who is willing to spend some time speaking english with you you may be able to offer them a language exchange where they spend 30 minutes speaking english with you and you spend 30 minutes speaking your native language with them if you live in an english speaking country you can practice by starting simple conversations with the people you meet whether it s saying hello to a shopkeeper or asking a stranger for directions even if you have an acceptable grasp of the english language with good grammar and an extensive vocabulary native english speakers may find you very difficult to understand if you don t work on your pronunciation correct clear pronunciation is essential if you really want to improve your level of english listen closely to how native english speakers pronounce certain words and sounds and do your best to copy them pay particular attention to any sounds that you are unfamiliar with or that do not exist in your native tongue for example some people have difficulty pronouncing the r sound as it does not exist in their native language while other people have difficulty with certain consonant clusters such as the th sound be aware that the pronunciation of certain english words varies greatly depending on the part of the world it s spoken in for example american english is very different from british english if you intend to travel to or live in an english speaking country this is something you should take into account when learning how to pronounce certain words the wider your vocabulary and the more english phrases you learn the easier speaking english will become again spending time with native english speakers will help you to pick up on common vocabulary and phrases in a natural way although reading watching english tv and listening to the news is also beneficial once you have learned a new word or phrase you should make an effort to use it in a sentence this is the best way to commit it to memory another easy way to commit new words to memory is to make labels for everyday household items and stick them around your house or apartment then every time you use the kettle or look in the mirror you will see the english word for these items staring back at you you should also start a notebook of idiomatic phrases that english speakers use all the time some examples include it s raining cats and dogs raining heavily to be on cloud nine to be very happy or saying something is a piece of cake when something is very easy sprinkling these kinds of phrases into your conversation will bring your level of english up several notches another great way to incorporate some extra english conversation into your weekly routine is to sign up for a class of discussion group attending an english class is a great way to focus on some of the more formal aspects of speaking english a class will teach you the grammatically correct way of speaking which includes proper sentence structure and verb conjugation and will generally provide a very structured approach to language learning attending a discussion group is a more informal and relaxed way of learning english where the emphasis is more on communication and relationship building than on speaking correct english speaking english in this setting can help you to become more comfortable with speaking in front of other people both of these language learning settings have their pros and cons so it s best to do both if you can carrying an english dictionary with you at all times whether it s an actual book or a phone app can be very useful having a dictionary means that you will never be stuck for a word it can save you a lot of embarrassment if you re having a conversation with an english speaker and forget a word in the middle of the sentence all you have to do is take a second to look it up aside from saving you awkwardness looking up the word you need then immediately using it in a sentence will actually help you to commit the new vocabulary to memory it is also helpful to have a dictionary to peruse throughout the day during private moments like when you re sitting on the train waiting to cross the street or just having a cup of coffee you could learn an extra 20 to 30 english words per day using this technique as a beginner you should start with an english dictionary that provides definitions in your native language however once your language skills improve you should switch to using an english english dictionary which provides english definitions for english words one of the best ways to improve your english listening comprehension is to download english language podcasts or radio apps on your phone or mp3 player you should then make an effort to listen to the podcasts or radio shows for at least 30 minutes per day do it in the gym on your commute to work or while you re sitting at your computer make an effort to understand what s being said don t just let the english wash over you even if you find it too fast try to pick out key words and phrases to get a general idea of what the conversation is about if you can make a note of any words or phrases that you don t understand and look up the translation afterwards then listen to the podcast or show again to hear the new words or phrases in context another fun way to improve your listening comprehension is to watch english movies and tv shows try to pick movies or tv shows that you will enjoy this will make the exercise feel like less of a chore if possible choose movies or shows that you are already familiar with such as children s cartoons or blockbuster films if you already know the basic story you will find the language much easier to pick up on however you should avoid watching movies or television shows with subtitles in your native language they will only distract you and make you less inclined to focus on understanding the english which is the whole point of the exercise reading is an essential part of learning a new language so don t forget to practice find something you are really interested in whether that s a famous english novel the new york times or a fashion magazine and start working your way through it if you find the content boring you will be less inclined to persevere with it again make an active effort to actually understand what you re reading don t just skim over it highlight any words or phrases that you don t understand then look them up in the dictionary if you re alone you could also try reading aloud this will allow you to improve your reading comprehension while also working on your pronunciation aside from reading and listening comprehension you should also spend some time working on your written english this may be one of the most difficult aspects of your language learning but it is important nevertheless writing in english will help you to work on your sentence structure grammar and spelling try keeping an english diary in which you write down a few sentences every day it doesn t have to be deeply personal you could write about the weather what you ate for dinner or what your plans are for the day if you feel comfortable with it get a native speaker to look over what you ve written and check it for any errors this will help you to avoid making the same mistakes over and over again once your written language skills have improved you could consider getting an english speaking pen pal having an english speaking pen pal combines your english writing practice with the excitement of getting a letter or email your pen pal may be someone who is learning english like you or they may be a native english speaker who wants to practice their foreign language skills by writing to you in your native tongue having a pen pal from an english speaking country such as the united states britain canada ireland australia new zealand or south africa for example will also allow you to learn more about the culture and what life is like in that part of the world when learning any new language it is important to stay motivated and never give up on your goal of fluency stay committed to your language learning goal by reminding yourself of how badly you want to achieve it think of all of the amazing experiences and opportunities that will be available to you once you ve mastered the english language you will be able to converse with english speakers from across the world and develop new and exciting relationships you will be able to engage with english speaking culture like never before and potentially further your career as a result of your new language skills if you want to to gain fluency quickly you need to commit to practicing every day learning a new language is based on repetition so if you wait too long between study sessions you will forget everything you learned previously and have to start all over again wasting valuable time however you shouldn t study so much that you grow sick of english try to keep things interesting by completing a different task each day one day of reading one day of listening comprehension one day of writing practice one day studying grammar etc however you should never pass up an opportunity to practice speaking english as this is the number one most important thing you can do to gain fluency one way to make the transition from being very good at english to being fluent is to train your brain to actually think in the english language constantly translating from your native language into english and back again inside your head consumes time and energy every language has its own nuances and peculiarities which makes it impossible to accurately translate from one language to another in certain instances as a result your spoken and written english will flow much more naturally and fluently if you can just train your brain to think in english think of it like a switch when it s time to communicate in english you need to turn your english brain on and your mother language brain off one of the greatest tests of a person s fluency in a second language is to put them in a room with a bunch of native speakers and see if they can follow and contribute to the conversation the best way to achieve this level of fluency is to make some english speaking friends and hang out with them in a social setting like in a cafe or bar this way you will be forced to speak in english if you want to interact with your peers but it won t feel like work or study because you ll be having so much fun the biggest obstacle that stands in the way of learning a new language is the fear of making mistakes this fear serves no purpose it is merely a hindrance that prevents you from reaching your goal of fluency don t be afraid of making a mistake and don t be shy of course you can t speak a new language perfectly at the start try to express yourself albeit with difficulty remember that everyone makes mistakes when they are learning a new language it s a rite of passage you will almost certainly have your fair share of awkward or embarrassing moments when you accidentally say something rude or incorrect but this is all part of the fun also remember that you are not aiming for perfection when learning to speak english you are aiming for progress making mistakes is all part of the learning process they will help you to become better so embrace them

about personal behaviour diffuse questions asked to shock others follow the policies provided to you by the community prepare to respond to people who oppose sex education every school state province or country will have its own set of requirements on how sex education can be taught in most cases if you are a professional educator you will most likely be required to follow a certain curriculum provided for you for example in the united states the u s department of health human service identifies 28 evidence based curriculums that are eligible to be taught your school or program may provide you materials and information from these curriculums the public health agency of canada provides canadian guidelines for sexual health education it is a guide that provides specific curricula and teaching strategies to teach sex education canadian sex education teaches key concepts like health health promotion health education sexuality sexual health and sexual rights in the united kingdom sex education is compulsory after age 11 and focuses on teaching children about reproduction sexuality and sexual health sex and relationship education sre is part of the national curriculum and is based on the personal social and health education pshe framework of knowledge guidelines can be found on the uk government website in some countries cultures religions and schools sex education for children is not compulsory or mandatory in these situations teaching sex education to children can be difficult for many reasons for example sex education might not be welcomed and you may run into roadblocks before you are allowed to teach it before teaching sex education you may have to speak to local officials about implementing sex education in your area this might mean speaking to schools your community or members of your government prepare resources and evidence that sex education is needed join an organization or group that advocates for the implementation of sex education for the community plan your own sex education curriculum you may be able to teach sex education but there are little resources available to you that provide tested and reputable sex education programs that can be taught in your area in these cases you may need to do extensive research talk to sexual health professionals and collaborate with institutions to come up with an effective sex education program in north america most curriculums advocate the need for comprehensive sexual health education where multiple topics are discussed and taught extensively issues taught include contraception gender sexuality abstinence abortion sexually transmitted diseases and much more comprehensive sexual health education is just one approach to sex education some other approaches include family life education this program places emphasis on preparing children for family life and reproduction population education this program focuses on the sociological environmental and economic consequences of population growth medical disease education this program emphasizes on avoiding disease and provides medical information about sexual health fear based approach this program emphasizes the risks of sexually transmitted infections diseases and hiv abstinence based education this programs focuses on abstinence from sex a way to avoid pregnancy and does not provide much coverage on how to use contraceptives how to have safe sex and how stis hiv work sexuality education this approach places more emphasis on the individual sexual activity sexology biology and behaviour it presents sexuality as a key part of life and includes message that sexuality and sex are pleasurable some sex education programs may already have detailed lesson plans for you to follow and some may only provide you with guidelines and will require you to come up with your own lessons in the case that you will need to plan your own lessons it is best to follow the established and accurate curriculums for sex education at your school community or sex health care provider these programs have been tested for effectiveness and will provide helpful advice approaches and strategies to aid you in teaching sex education reach out to other educators who have already implemented or taught sex education ask them what was effective what didn t work and how they approached sex education with their learners you may need to establish your own curriculum if you are teaching groups that need special attention such as learners who have mental disabilities lgbtq learners or if you are teaching in a community with specific beliefs and religious views to better prepare yourself to answer any questions a learner might ask it s important you understand the material you will be teaching you can go online to your local library or bookstore to find information about sex sexual health and sexuality there are also many organizations that provide courses and materials to help educators teach sex education sex education is more than just teaching about sexual behaviours this means you should also educate yourself on issues such as abstinence body image gender sexuality sexual development sexually transmitted diseases sexual health and sexual pleasure use established evaluated sex education sources and curriculums to aid in your research there are many myths and misconceptions that surround sex education and sex in general knowing what the truth is and having accurate information about sex education can help you teach better and prevent you from relaying inaccurate or negative information to your learners educating yourself about sex can help increase your comfort level with talking about sex or certain topics related to it to others age is an important factor that will shape how you educate sex to your learners some parents guardians and educators will be uncomfortable with sex being taught to children as young as kindergarten but using age appropriate information to teach sex education can help ease worries and discomforts about teaching such a sensitive topic like sex different issues or topics will be taught depending on a learner s age established curriculums will have versions that are tailored to the age of the learner knowing the stage of sexual development of your learners will aid you in answering questions and help you provide age appropriate information and resources for your learners this way you can avoid situations where you overstep boundaries or teach beyond what is appropriate to your learners defining your goals or what you would like your learners to achieve after you teach is a helpful way to organize and teach your lessons in general most sex educators strive for these goals to reduce negative outcomes from sexual behaviours such as unwanted or unplanned pregnancies and infection from sexually transmitted diseases to provide appropriate knowledge and skills for learners to make healthy decisions about their sex life and future to build self confidence in learners to help learners develop positive relationships and experiences with their sexuality to provide medically accurate information about concepts like abstinence contraception and other health concerns to respect community social and individual values and beliefs regarding sex if you are a teacher or someone who works for the community or a sexual health organization you will most likely be teaching in a classroom setting whether you re a teacher parent guardian or a friend it s important you set up a safe environment to talk about sex a safe environment allows learners to feel positive and confident as they learn and ask questions is free of negative judgements discourages censorship and instead promotes an open and honest environment can be in a classroom at a community centre or at home gender sex and sexuality are different concepts that are often confused together by differentiating them you can help ease a learner s confusion about their identity especially for those who are struggling with non normative identities these identities include people who may have gender identity issues like trans youth or those who may be questioning their sexuality reach out to the community to obtain a better understanding of these complex issues there are many organizations within the lgbtq community that can provide you with materials resources and even curriculums for you to follow advocate for safer policies regarding issues like homophobia or transphobia trans and lgbtq youth are more likely to be harassed and abused verbally physically and sexually by educating or approaching the community with these issues you help save lives of lgtbq individuals and foster a more accepting environment partner with professionals that specialize in certain topics to ensure your curriculum covers everything accurately and effectively for example you may ask invite a member of the lgbtq community to lead a lesson and talk about their experiences and share their knowledge about sexual health and well being to your learners make sure your curriculum is age appropriate culturally sensitive and respects the beliefs and values of differing groups this may be difficult to do but it s not impossible by getting feedback from other educators professionals and parents or guardians of learners you can help ensure your curriculum is appropriate this can be very beneficial if you find the topic of sex education uncomfortable to discuss try talking casually and openly to a peer or a close friend about sexual health or practice teaching your lesson to someone you re close with this exercise can help you with become comfortable talking about sex and also provide you with feedback on how effective your teaching is practicing can help you avoid mistakes like being overly critical of someone else s opinion about sex laughing in times of discomfort or embarrassment and avoid lecturing or talking down to people when you re teaching while teaching young learners it s extremely important you keep parents and guardians involved in the process of sex education send parents and guardians a letter detailing the sexual health program you will be teaching to their children this way learners can choose to either opt out of the lesson or provide you with comments before you start teaching many sexual health organizations and curriculums can provide educators with a sample letter to use to send to parents and guardians you can send simple outlines of each lesson or a detailed summary of the whole program if you are teaching adult learners it is also important to let them know what you plan to teach some learners may have differing beliefs and values and may choose to opt out of certain lessons or from the entire program you ll be teaching the thought of teaching sex education for infants can be daunting and taboo but most parents guardians and caregivers already teach infants sex education without even knowing it from age 0 to 3 children will begin to explore their bodies learn the differences between males and females and start to form their own gender identities sex education for infants takes the form of teaching children about their bodies and helping them form healthy relationships and bonds with caregivers if you are teaching infants about their sexual health you are most likely their parent guardian or primary caregiver most institutions do acknowledge the importance of sex education for infants but it is unlikely there are any formal educational programs out there for children that young by making the conscious effort to teach infants about their bodies about genders and by promoting good relationships you are creating a positive foundation for their future sexual well being children start to learn body parts as infants and are often told to show caregivers their nose eyes and ears for example at this time infants should also be taught the correct names of their genitalia by teaching children early they will become comfortable and familiar with their bodies and be more aware of sexual or reproductive health problems as they age and will be more likely to seek help use opportunities like bath time or diaper changes to teach infants about their bodies it can be as simple as pointing to a child s genitals and saying that is your penis or that is your vulva you can also start to make associations between sex and genitalia by saying females have vaginas and males have penises however it is important to understand the difference between sex and gender and decide how you would like to teach your child about gender many children will develop curiosity about the body as young as 2 years old they may start engaging in behaviours such as asking each other about their bodies peeking at each others bodies in bathrooms or even showing private body parts to each other young children may also start to hug kiss and touch each other at this point it is important to talk to children about the basic rules of privacy such as your body is your own children should learn that their body belongs to them and no one can touch it without their permission they should be taught how to say no to kissing hugging and other types of physical contact they don t want whether it is appropriate or not good touch versus bad touch children should be taught how to recognize appropriate and inappropriate touching a good way to teach this is to use the underwear rule this means touching anywhere that is covered by underwear is inappropriate they should also be taught to consult with a trusted adult or family member when bad touches happen good secrets and bad secrets teaching children that there are bad secrets and good secrets helps prevent sexual abusers from manipulating children into keeping secrets like if they are being touched inappropriately or being abused by two a child will begin to understand what gender is and even identify their own gender identity however it is common for children to experiment with their gender identity through role playing and dressing up it s important to be aware of your child s gender expression so you can prepare for certain situations some children may start to show signs of being transgender children may ask questions or make assumptions about what is correct behaviour for a certain gender other people or children may disagree with a child s gender expression and cause the child distress children at this age will begin to ask questions about babies such as where did i come from or where do babies come from you can start to tell young children the basics of reproduction babies grow in the uterus of a woman you may use different language like you came from mommy s belly or mommy made you a male and female is required for reproduction or mommy and daddy made you it is always recommended to use accurate and correct language to eliminate confusion in the future and allow children to be comfortable with talking about reproduction children as young as 8 may begin to experience puberty both physically and mentally it is important to make children aware what changes may follow such as physical changes like the growth of genitals breast development and menstruation in females and growth spurts sexual feelings that may lead to sexual attraction to others and masturbation emotional changes that affect how children see themselves their self image and how they relate to others like their parents family and friends elementary aged children may start to become physically intimate with each other and start dating kissing or touching some older children may even begin to explore the idea of being sexually intimate with someone some education programs will start to educate elementary aged children about protection and contraceptives when engaging in sex as well as the effects of hivs aids and stis stds the continuation of teaching children that their bodies are their own will help them engage in safe and healthy relationships with others at this time children will come across difficulties with expressing themselves or have trouble understanding what is happening to them as puberty begins it s important to address issues such as sexuality since children at this age will start to develop attraction towards one another some may experience difficulty adjusting to their sexuality especially if they identify as gay lesbian bisexual or anything other than what is assumed as normal provide resources and comfort to help children adjust to their sexuality gender identity some children may be expressing their gender differently or identify as transgender validate these differences by providing children tools and resources to better navigate their gender and also protect them from discrimination or bullying masturbation in most sex education programs masturbation is seen as a healthy and normal activity many may have questions about masturbation or about their sudden development of intense sexual feelings that might have lead to incidents like having wet dreams family life family life may be affected since parents or family members may start to give more responsibilities to older children and even divide tasks based on gender at this time sex or gender discrimination is an important topic to cover body image with all the physical changes happening it s important to address healthy ways to deal with low self esteem or issues with body image some children from 15 to 19 years old will be sexually active so it is important to talk about what consent is what it looks like and stress the importance of it teaching consent will decrease the likelihood of sexual violence and also promote healthier relationships and better overall sexual health an overview of consent includes knowing that consent is a voluntary and enthusiastic yes it is not based on silence previous sexual activities or what the person is wearing consent needs to be asked and given both parties should ask each other if they would be willing to engage in a certain sexual activity and both parties should answer consent is not coercion pressuring someone into sex threatening them intimidating them blackmailing then or guilt tripping them into sexual acts are all forms of coercion depending on your program or curriculum you may need to teach children how to use protection or about contraception you may need to provide them with demonstrations resources and discuss the benefits and effects of using protection and contraceptives be sure to talk about the wide variety of contraceptives available for example condoms can be used by both females and males teach children the effects of having unprotected sex these include having an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy and receiving and transmitting diseases if you are following a specific program or curriculum it is most likely you will be given teaching strategies to learn and use in most cases these strategies were tested researched and judged as the best way to teach a certain sex education program some curriculums will be very specific providing you with detailed lesson plans activities and strategies many educators will work with their school community or sexual health organization to figure out what the best approaches and strategies to teaching sex education are if there are particular strategies or approaches that you believe are effective you can always find a way to become involved with how sex education is taught to others join organizations your school board or speak to officials about ways to better sex education in your area most sexual health organizations encourage educators to adopt cooperative learning strategies this means students or learners work with others in assignments discussions and projects this gets students involved in their learning and helps them construct meaning from information on their own some examples of cooperative learning strategies include inquiry based learning this approach places students questions ideas and observations in the centre of their learning experience you will act as a provocateur or someone that introduces students to ideas or topics that is of interest to them or what matters to them students are guided to investigate and look for answers using critical thinking skills problem solving skills and evidence based reasoning problem based learning this approach begins by presenting a problem to students before they receive any knowledge about a topic this method gives you more control of what topics or problems to focus on after students are informed of the problem they are encouraged to seek knowledge and solutions cooperatively together for example you could make up a hypothetical problem like sally doesn t want to have sex with her boyfriend how can she tell her boyfriend this and then ask students to come up with a solution project based learning this approach has students working on a long term project that addresses and investigates complex questions problems or challenges in sex education a popular project based learning approach used in sex education is to simulate what having a baby is like students bring home a life like baby doll that cries eats poops and pees and is asked to care for it for an extended period of time the project helps students realize that caring for a child can be difficult and teaches them responsibility you can use pictures diagrams videos or visual demonstrations to keep students engaged while you re teaching try these activities fill in the blank diagrams this is especially helpful to demonstrate the human body and things related to it such as the menstrual cycle genitalia areas affected by puberty or the reproduction cycle watch informative videos in most sex education curriculums videos will be provided to help you teach your students demonstrate how to do things in many sex education courses educators will demonstrate with objects how to put on a condom how to use a menstrual pad or tampon how contraceptives work and how sexually transmitted diseases work it s important these demonstrations only simulate the actual action you may have seen educators put condoms on bananas or use small cups of water to demonstrate how a tampon works journal writing encourages students to record reflect and write about their health learning many health care providers encourage people of all ages and life stages to use journal writing to keep track of their health concerns having a health care journal can keep track of your health it s easier to detect patterns if you record any concerns you have about your health the moment it happens a constant ache or pain could indicate a bigger problem if it has been happening for days or weeks a injury in the past might explain a new health concern today keep track of medications a journal could help remind you to take medication get tested regularly or inform them of what medications they have used in the past provide an overall review of a person s health just by recording all things health related a health care journal can give a brief summary of your health after teaching your students it s important to evaluate how effective your teaching was there are many ways you can assess your students do a comprehension check you can simply ask students to reiterate what they learned after a lesson or give them a quiz or do a review exercise observe your students you may notice a few disengaged students or you may realize a certain topic makes everyone feel uncomfortable by observing your students you can assess how effective your lesson was assess projects and assignments according to a rubric this is a more accurate way to measure the success of your lesson many curriculums provided by your school or a health care organization will have rubrics to help you assess students learning rules help create a safe and open discussion during your lesson tell your learners to listen and speak appropriately during your lesson this might mean raising their hand speaking only when called and using appropriate language when talking respect other students some students may be reluctant to share information or ask questions that might sound silly to others respecting each other means being non judgemental towards one another maintain confidentiality during the lesson personal experiences and information might be shared during the lesson and students should be told not to share these stories or information to others outside of the class let your students know that you are here to discuss facts and opinions about sexual health not to expose or push students to talk about their own or any sexual experiences refrain from talking about your own sexual experiences if it doesn t enrich or benefit the lesson and your learners in some situations especially if you have a very close or casual relationship with your learners sharing stories and experiences can help relax students and even open them up to express their own opinions and questions however it s best to avoid this unless you have a very good and mutual understanding with your learners in some situations sharing explicit personal information about yourself can make learners feel uncomfortable a great educator is not only someone who is able to relay information to their learners but is also one who is able to listen and inspire their learners there are many ways you can encourage your students refrain from taking a one sided point of view on a issue instead express an open attitude and willingness to listen and discuss any and all issues relating to sexual health show that you value a learner s opinion or what they have to say use validating responses or phrases like that s an interesting comment you ve made or i think what you said is very important or i understand your concern ask for your learners opinions on an issue after explaining an issue or concept open the discussion by asking if anyone has questions concerns or comments they d like to make ask what they think about what you ve just taught them be flexible when teaching your lesson sometimes learners will have burning questions that they can t keep until the end to ask encourage and allow students to ask questions or make comments whenever they arise even if they might steer the discussion towards an unintended topic in your lesson plan however always use judgement not every question is worth answering right then and there every learner will enter a sex education course or classroom with different ideas on how sex or sexual health works a good way to ease into the beginning of a lesson is to ask your students to share what they know about a certain topic this activity encourages students to actively participate in discussions knowing what the students already know can help give you an idea how to go about the lesson you will have a better sense of what issues to focus more on and any misinformation you will need to correct in any setting there will be learners who are shy or feel uncomfortable asking their questions in front of a large group give opportunities to these learners by providing resources to them direct students to reputable resources where they can find their own answers to their questions such as websites books or information from sexual health organizations giving them a point of contact to discuss their concerns with their own sexual health it can be a guidance counsellor a sexual health professional or service or even you let learners submit questions anonymously a helpful activity to try in class is to have all your students write down their questions or concerns on a piece of paper and submit it to your anonymously you can then answer these questions in front of the class or incorporate the questions in a future lesson although you should encourage students to openly ask questions you should also evaluate which questions are appropriate to answer and which are just asked to produce a reaction rather than to enhance learning tell your students if i don t answer a question it s not because it s a bad question it might be that i feel it isn t an interest to all students if you ask a question and i don t answer it ask me again after class in private even if you don t answer a question or come across an opinion or question you can t respond to you can validate the student s comment some helpful ways to respond to students comments is to give affirmation thanks for asking that is a great question or please tell me more about what you d like to know ask for clarification positively sounds like you have a real concern can you please tell me more about what s on your mind or that sounds like an important question could you explain it to me a bit more address feelings some questions may be loaded with feelings such as embarrassment or disgust try prefacing your answer by saying we are all embarrassed sometimes but it s important to discuss it normalize the question many people ask that question or that s something a lot of people have wondered about but never use the word normal normal is not a proper term to use as it has a heavy social meaning to it rather than a medical meaning in one setting or culture something normal might be abnormal in another if there is a question you don t know the answer to let your students know at the same time validate their questions or concerns to let them know you understand them and will be working hard to answer their question eventually if a question makes you uncomfortable let your students know you might not be able to control your reaction or feelings toward a question and letting your students know how you feel about a question can help clarify why you can t answer a question try saying i m a bit uncomfortable with this question and follow up with validation students might ask questions about their own personal behaviours that you may or may not want to discuss with the class you might be asked questions like is it normal to or did you when you were growing up these questions might be religious or culturally loaded and may question morals rather than the facts you are teaching deal with these questions by reinforcing the ground rules if you choose not to answer personal behaviour questions tell students we won t be discussing personal behaviour questions during this class referring students to other resources other sexual health care professionals parents guardians or religious organizations may be better equipped at answering questions about morals surrounding sexual health speak to them privately about their concern a question about a personal behaviour might be better understood in context you might find out a student s family is religious after they ask you if abortions are okay you might then refer them to the appropriate person to speak to about such an issue some students may ask questions to shock others into a reaction they might have a real concern but are too embarrassed to address it seriously or they feel the need to divert attention away from the topic being discussed never assume these questions are silly or tell students that their question is silly instead remind students of your ground rules and try to guide this question into a teachable topic reword any slang vocabulary to diffuse the question a student might ask why do balls hurt when they re hit you could respond by saying first the proper term for balls is testicles testicles are very sensitive and do hurt when they re hit and proceed to answer their question students may also criticize certain topics and say statements like guys only want sex from girls you can respond by addressing the underlying concern in a question or statement in this example you can respond by saying it seems like you are concerned about respect in relationships each institution community and country will have different policies that dictate how sex education can be taught these policies might come from the community or they could come from larger bodies of governance in some cases a conservative community will have certain views on how sex should be talked about and taught however that does not necessarily mean that is how sex education should be taught and instead the education system may have differing views and policies on how to teach certain sexual health topics discuss with community leaders educators and organizations on what sex education looks like in a conservative community they may have advice or provide you with guidelines on how to communicate with learners and their families and even how to manage controversy and criticism about sex education remember the goal of sex education is promote sexual health to learners do what is best for your learners but practice judgement people who oppose to sex education are not limited to conservative communities the first thing to do if you come across someone who opposes sex education is to listen to their point of view and their reasoning do not belittle them or antagonize them by telling them they are misinformed or lack knowledge instead respond to their concerns calmly and be as helpful as you can there are many reasons why someone might oppose to sex education they lack knowledge about your program and don t know how you will implement sex education give them information about your program the lessons you will be teaching and your goals while teaching if a whole community is opposed to sex education because of this reason bring written material about your program to community meetings to community members and discuss your program with them they fear they sex education will distress or corrupt young people let them know that sex education advocates for responsible sexual health and does not always primarily focus on sexual activities or behaviours they believe talking about sex leads to sexual activity there are many reputable and authoritative studies that show sex education does not increase sexual experimentation instead sex education only changes the way sex is performed usually meaning people who have had sex education are more likely to use contraceptives and get tested for stis sex education opposes their moral religious or cultural beliefs let them know that it is perfectly okay to opt out of sex education or let them know when certain topics will be discussed and allow the option to opt out of classes that go against a certain belief

assistant and a teacher for example then you may need two resumes that highlight different strengths make sure your resume is easy to read and that it s obvious where you worked what your position was and how long you worked there some positions will ask you to list your references right on your resume prepare to have at least 2 3 people who can vouch for you before you begin the job hunt have a friend or a professional in your field look over your resume to give suggestions for how to make it more readable size 11 font has been shown to be the most appealing font to employers you can try font 10 if you really have a lot of information to cover but you shouldn t go smaller than that there is the option of paying companies to help you spruce up your resume but this can cost a pretty penny use a simple font most preferably times new roman if you feel like you don t have the needed skills to even land an interview in your field then you may need to do a bit of skill building before you take your resume out into the world there are a variety of ways to gain more experience before putting yourself out there if that s what you want to do see if you can gain experience at an internship even if you re only doing it a few hours a week though the work won t be paid most likely it s a great way to get your foot in the door and to gain the skills you need to get an impressive resume there are also many opportunities to learn skills online for example if you re applying for editing jobs and notice that many of them prefer a candidate who knows basic html find an online class that can help you master this skill talk to people in the field that you want to enter they can help you get a sense of the skills you should possess before you start looking for a job some studies show that up to 70 80 of jobs are found through networking not through the traditional job application process if you want to dramatically increase your chances of getting a job then you have to try to network with professionals in your field as well as with people you know as much as you can though this may feel like you re cheating think of it as giving yourself the edge you need to succeed it makes sense that it s much easier to get a job through networking employers want to hire someone who can be vouched for instead of facing a pile of anonymous resumes it makes their job much easier you may not think that you know anyone who can help you get a job however even if your friends or family members don t directly have a connection to anyone in your field you should tell them that you re starting your job hunt to see if they know someone who knows someone who can be an asset to you if you ve gone to college and your school has regular networking events in the area try attending a few to see who you can meet make sure you prepare your elevator pitch before you go to these events so you can comfortably tell people who you are and what you re looking for when they ask you to tell them a little bit about yourself once you have your resume up to date have tried your hand at networking and have an idea of what you re looking for then you can begin your job search check out all of the different job searching sites on the internet and look for positions that sound perfect for you you should pick jobs that you feel fairly qualified for though you can go out on a limb and apply for a job that may ask for a bit more experience than you have if you feel like you can make up for it in other ways remember that it s important to apply to a job while it s hot or recently posted the most activity around a job posting happens in the first three days so if you find a job that sounds absolutely perfect for you try to apply for as soon as you can instead of putting it off until the weekend some popular sites for looking for jobs are indeed com simplyhired com monster com or even craigslist com you can also look for job search sites that are more relevant for your field for example if you re looking to get a job at a startup then you can try sites like ventureloop com once you ve found a job you want to apply to you should take the time to write a concise eye catching cover letter that shows why you re perfect for the job if you really want to succeed then yes you should individualize each cover letter to the job you re applying for this shows employers that you take the job seriously and that you really want to be a part of their team if you can find the name of the hiring manager or the person in charge of your application then addressing your cover letter to this person shows that you really care use engaging language instead of saying i believe i am a strong candidate for the job say something more exciting like i would love to bring my enthusiasm and experience to your team make sure to address the qualifications and qualities the company is looking for and to show how you possess them and how you would succeed in the position don t just regurgitate your resume give them more details about work you ve done or interests you have that they can t find out about through your resume alone keep it short and sweet just two paragraphs talking about who you are and why you d be a good fit for the company and one paragraph saying where you can be reached and that you would look forward to an interview will be just fine keep your language professional and appropriate to the company if the company is a serious business then you shouldn t try to use casual jokey language however if you re applying to write for an online humor journal you can be a bit more creative in your word choice once you ve found a few jobs to apply for go ahead and send in your resume and cover letter and hope for the best if you want to take initiative you can send a follow up email to make sure the hiring manager got your materials after a week or so to show that you really care if you re really serious about the job search then you should aim to apply to at least a few positions each week as long as they sound relatively appealing some companies can take months to get back to you so it s best to keep your options open and to cast a wide net as you apply to more and more positions it will become easier because it won t be as hard to tailor your cover letter to each job the fact of the matter is the job search process is an arduous one and it can take several months or even longer to find a job that suits you the average person applies to over 60 jobs before finding that perfect fit so you shouldn t feel discouraged if you apply to 30 or 40 jobs and don t hear a peep back this is a reflection of the market and the fact that many jobs are posted but given to internal hires or people who get them through networking don t think that this means you ll never find a job and continue your search though this will take up a lot of your time and may be draining imagine how good you ll feel when you finally land that perfect job after so much hard work don t let the job search affect your mental state many people get really discouraged by the whole process but you can t let it get you down rest assured that if you work hard enough you are bound to succeed continue to network as you search for jobs the traditional way you never know what you may turn up if you ve landed an interview then the most important thing you can do in advance is to prepare as much as you can for your big day you want to read up on the company understand what the position truly entails practice answering relevant interview questions for your field and make sure you have plenty of specific examples to illustrate how you have the qualities your employers are looking for you ll probably be asked about your biggest strengths make sure you re prepared with specific examples of why you possess these strengths and make sure that they are skills that your interviewers are looking for for the position you may be asked about your weaknesses or areas of improvement don t say that your biggest weakness is that you work too hard they ve all heard that before instead you should mention a weakness that isn t that bad and which isn t crucial to the position and also mention steps you re taking to improve that weakness you will likely be asked why you re a good fit for the company make sure you understand the company s mission and goals and talk about any relevant things about the company such as the workplace culture that make you a good fit for the team prepare to answer behavioral questions too such as what would you do if a manager was out of line or how would you control a classroom with several rowdy students the worst thing you can do is to roll in to an interview late this shows that you really don t care about the job aim to get there at least half an hour early and then walk in to the building 5 10 minutes early this shows that you have your act together without you being so early that your interviewers are annoyed or thrown off use this time to get yourself in a calm and positive state instead of reviewing your answers bring a copy of your resume and cover letter with you along with any other relevant materials you may need to bring this can help you answer your questions and can show that you ve put thought into your interview obviously dressing professionally and looking your best is a must when it comes to an interview even if the environment at the job you re applying for is a bit more casual you should err on the side of being overdressed than looking overly casual in a more professional setting wear well fitting neat and appropriate clothing and make sure you re well groomed and look put together for the interview looking professional will not only show your employers that you take your job seriously but it will also give you more confidence as you go through your interview it s important to be confident well spoken and articulate as you answer your interview questions speak clearly and slowly enough to be understood look your interviewers in the eye and know that it s okay to take a minute to form your response instead of blurting out your answers before you re ready make sure to answer the questions confidently without coming off as arrogant and be comfortable asking for clarification when it s necessary when you speak make sure to keep your posture solid and keep your hands on your lap avoid fidgeting or staring at the floor this can help you sound confident at the end of most interviews employers ask if you have any questions for them you should remember that the interview really works both ways and that it s up to you to see if the job is a good fit for you as well prepare a few questions to show that you really care about the position and want to be as involved as you can if you say that you have absolutely no questions this can indicate that you haven t really done your research you can ask things like how would you describe the office culture at your company or will there be opportunities to collaborate with other employees or i read about the name here project online i was wondering if you could tell me more about it if the interviewers truly did answer all of your questions you can say i was going to ask more about mention the aspect of the job here but you ve already covered that there are a few no nos when it comes to interviewing successfully though you should focus on the positive aspects of interviewing you should make an effort not to do a few things that show employers that you re not really all that serious about your job here are a few things you want to try to avoid when it comes to interviewing avoid asking about perks before you ve gotten the job if you re already asking about vacation days and bonuses before you ve been hired it ll show that you care more about what comes with the job than the job itself don t bring your coffee into the interview with you this shows that you re taking too much of a casual approach to the interview if they ask why you left or want to leave your current position avoid bad mouthing your previous employer even if your old or current boss is a real jerk you should never say this say something like i ve gained a ton of valuable experience at my current job but i m ready for a new challenge don t mention that you ve applied to 80 other jobs without getting an interview you want your employers to feel like the position they are hiring for is your 1 choice the most important way to make sure you keep your job is to have a strong relationship with your boss you don t need to be best friends with your boss but you should have a friendly relationship that is based on mutual respect and strong communication though each boss has his or her own style you should make sure to be friendly with your boss and receptive to what he or she has to say and to show that you really care about him or her though some bosses are much more private about their personal lives than others if your boss is open about his interests or his family then you can take the time to ask him about it when you re making small talk if you have issues with your job take it up with your boss respectfully don t complain to your coworkers instead or you risk having that get back to you when your other co workers gossip about your boss try to remove yourself from the situation another way to make sure you to keep your job is to show that you can play well with others if you want to seem like an important part of your company then you should be friendly with your co workers receptive to their ideas and willing to openly collaborate and communicate with the people you work with even if you disagree occasionally you should do so respectfully so that you seem like you can get along with anyone if you have a reputation for not being able to get along with other co workers then your boss will see that it s hard to fit you into a team however if you re the one making people laugh and feel good at the office it ll be hard to picture the office without you make an effort to attend office activities after work such as happy hours volunteering events or team building activities though you don t have to attend every event you should make an effort to show that you do care about your co workers outside the office steer clear of office gossip you don t want to get a reputation for talking about people behind their backs one way to make sure you keep your job is to try to maintain a positive attitude around the office as much as you can talk about the things you love about your job instead of complaining about the things you don t like and make an effort to make other people smile and to avoid whining about the small details you re not so thrilled about get a reputation for always having a smile on your face and it ll be much more likely that you ll keep your job of course if something really upsets you at the office you should have a respectful conversation with your boss about it you don t need to fake it if you really feel like something isn t right try to laugh or be cheerful as much as you can you want people to feel like they are gaining energy from your presence not being drained by you if you want to keep your job then you should make sure to be eager and excited about whatever challenges come your way you don t want to look like you don t want to do anything beyond your job description if your boss asks you to take on an extra project or to try something new you should accept it and be excited about all of the new things you will learn if you continue to challenge yourself not only will you impress your boss but you will also make your job much more fun and rewarding you want to be known as the person who will be happy to take on extra work or to learn something new you should be the first person your boss thinks of when it s time to tackle a new project showing up to work on time or even a little early may not sound like a huge deal but it s actually an important way to show your boss and everyone in the company how much your work means to you make an effort to show up at least 15 20 minutes early each day so you ll at least be there on time if you run into an unexpected delay plus if you get there a little early you can get a head start on your day if you do show up late make sure to apologize and show that you know this is not acceptable you don t want to seem smug about it make sure to be punctual to all meetings as well you should make a sincere effort to be neat and organized in all of the work that you do make sure your computer files and all of the files of your desk are in order that your appointment calendar is up to date and that you have a to do list that is easy to accomplish and easy to read if you spend just 10 minutes a day cleaning up your workspace and organizing your files you should be in great shape being organized is another sign of somebody who really takes his or her work seriously if your boss asks you to send him a file and it takes you an hour to find it then this shows that you don t really value your work if you want to show that you take your job seriously then you have to show up to the office looking professional though some offices are more casual than others you have to adhere to the dress code and show that you re really determined to make a good impression plus you will feel more professional if you look more professional and having a disheveled appearance will make it look like you really don t want to put in the effort if you care for your appearance then your boss your clients and your customers will take you more seriously another way to make sure you keep your job is to be creative and innovative in your position and to always look out for new ways to do things you don t want your boss to think that you re set in your ways and that you re not ready for the next challenge that your job will bring technology and the work many people do is rapidly changing and you have to be ready to roll with the punches and even ready to propose ideas for how to do your work more efficiently be eager to suggest new ways of doing things to your boss and to show him or her that you re always thinking outside the box if you want to keep your job then you have to be able to take feedback well and to understand that constructive feedback is meant to make you do better at your job not to make you feel inadequate in some way you should be respectful and thankful when your boss takes the time to give you feedback and use it to improve what you do on a daily basis if you re mean or unreceptive to feedback then your boss will see that you re not willing to improve at your job of course not every drop of feedback may always be helpful to you still you should be kind and gracious when you receive it show that you want to go above and beyond by continuing your professional training even after you ve landed your job take night classes get a part time master s degree attend conferences read relevant journals in your field talk to experts and just do whatever it is you want to do in order to stay up to date about the innovations in your field and to do the best work that you can if your boss knows that you re continuing your professional training then he ll see that you re really committed to excelling in your field and taking your job to the next level honestly when it comes down to it the best thing you can do to keep your job is to truly love all of the work that you do if you feel like you re faking it at work or pretending to be interested in most of the things you do then it may be time to find a position that is better suited to your interests if you find something that truly suits you then you ll feel like you never have to work a day in your life if you really love your work then you won t have to make an effort to be positive to advance in your field and to find new ways to succeed at what you do every single day

query	63	cite an essay whether you re a high school student or a professional writer you may need to cite your sources using a specific formatting style while there are many different styles out there the three most commonly used ones are the mla apa and chicago styles these style guides both ensure that writers don t plagiarize the work of others and provides readers with a roadmap to find the information that informs the paper because citations are such an important part of research you should follow directions precisely citing an essay in mla citing an essay in apa citing an essay in chicago style s note bibliography system citing an essay in chicago style s author date system make sure mla is the correct style for your document be able to recognize the two components of citation include the right information in the in text citation every time you reference material in your paper you must tell the reader the name of the author whose information you are citing learn when in text citations are necessary every single source that contains information you used must be included in your works cited and cited in text choose the appropriate in text citation method in text citations are often parenthetical meaning you add information to the end of a sentence in parentheses adjust in text citations if you have multiple sources from an author if you have two sources from james smith an in text citation of smith 235 may confuse the reader include the first initial if you have authors with the same last name say you used information from essays by james smith and susan smith format the citation in the works cited any information that gets cited in text must have a corresponding citation in the works cited follow the format for an essay found in an anthology you may have found your essay in an anthology along with other essays curated by an editor include different information for essays published in journals add electronic information for sources found in online databases many essays can be accessed through a school s online library databases determine if apa is the right style for your document learn what information to include in text in mla you only needed to include the author s last name and the page number in text distinguish in text between multiple sources by the same author in the reference list you will list multiple essays by the same author alphabetically by the first major word of the title add the first initial if you have authors with the same last name just as you would in mla you provide a little bit of information about the author s first name to clear up reader confusion format the citation in the reference list decide which kind of chicago style formatting you should use while apa and mla are used by different types of disciplines chicago can be used by a wide range of writers place footnotes at the bottom of the page when using the notes bibliography system you show that you want to cite a quote idea or other content by using a footnote put endnotes after the body of the paper a second way to format the notes bibliography system is to point the superscript notes in text to a full bibliography at the end of the document format your notes properly notes are single spaced but you should skip lines between entries shorten the note for each source after the first usage if you use a source on the first page of your paper then again on the 10th then again on the 14th your notes will get bloated with repetitive information create a bibliography the bibliography in this style is optional because all the sources are cited in notes already format the bibliography entries properly unlike the notes information in the bibliography entries are separated by periods instead of commas use parenthetical citations in text the chicago author date style is like a mixture of mla and apa include information to distinguish between multiple authors and essays if needed if you have multiple authors with the same last name include the first initial in the parenthetical citation j smith 2005 192 create a reference list mla is the formatting style of the modern language association it s used in humanities areas like english studies comparative literature foreign language and literature or cultural studies if you are writing for a class or to publish check the teacher or publisher s preference for formatting style students should read assignment sheets and course syllabi writers seeking publication should check submission guidelines if you still can t tell what style you should be using after reading the directions contact the instructor or publisher when citing an essay you include information in two places in the body of your paper and in the works cited that comes after it the works cited is just a bibliography you list all the sources you used to write the paper the citation information you include in the body of the paper itself is called the in text citation you must include a page number that tells the reader where in the source they can find this information the most basic structure for an in text citation looks like this smith 123 in mla in text citations always come at the end of the sentence the period that would end the sentence comes after the parenthetical citation the most obvious time to use an in text citation is when you quote from a source directly or refer to it by title or author however you also need to use an in text citation any time you use information that you got from a source but which isn t common knowledge this can be a tricky concept to master if you can t determine if information is common knowledge or proprietary work that belongs to the original author cite it anyways to be safe failing to attribute information that is the product of someone else s work is plagiarism the repercussions can be severe for example it is common knowledge that world war ii broke out in 1939 nobody owns that information but specific strategies quotes from important figures in the war and statistics about how many people were involved in the war are all examples of specific proprietary information the author of the source you used to research that information had to do the work of finding that information out you must attribute it to them but if you include that necessary information in the language of the sentence itself you should not include the parenthetical citation correct a recent study determined that himalayan brown bears eat both plants and animals rathore and chauhan 6652 correct rathore and chauhan determined that himalayan brown bears eat both plants and animals 6652 incorrect rathore and chauhan determined that himalayan brown bears eat both plants and animals rathore and chauhan 6652 you should not list the author s parenthetically if that information is in the sentence itself plagiarism a recent study determined that himalayan brown bears eat both plants and animals the writer did not attribute proprietary information to the people who conducted the study when they look up the source on your works cited sheet they will find two different articles by james smith to avoid this confusion you must include a shortened version of the essay s title so the readers know which essay to look for imagine that the two james smith articles are titled beloved and the haunting trauma and writing what you know you want to reference the first article in text correct james argues that one of sethe s most deeply held beliefs in beloved is the physical persistence of memory beloved 235 correct it could be argued that sethe is haunted by the physical persistence of memory smith beloved 235 an in text citation of smith 689 doesn t tell the reader which author provided the information in that case include the first initial of the author s last name in the in text citation s smith 689 when the reader sees a quote or idea that they would like to know more about they will look up the source author by the last name you listed in the in text citation they will also know which page of the source they should look at to find the information they want depending on where you found the essay your citation will follow a different format regardless of what format you follow one thing remains constant across all citations you always indent all lines that come after the first line of a works cited citation this lets the reader know where one citation ends and the next one begins mla also uses title case ever time a title is given this means that first word and all major words are capitalized the sound and the fury this is distinguished from sentence case in which only the first word is capitalized the sound and the fury in this case you must include the following information in this exact order lastname first name title of essay in title case anthology in title case ed editor s name s city of publication publisher year of publication page range print for example smith jane an essay about wikihow wikihow the collected essays ed mark jones new york wikihow publishers 2015 115 124 print if you found the article in an academic journal you have a different set of information to include some of the information like author name essay title and page range stay the same but you should follow this format exactly author s title of article title of journal volume issue year pages medium of publication for example smith jane an essay about wikihow the journal of wikihow 13 2 2015 115 124 print examples include ebscohost jstor and lexis nexis these databases store electronic versions of print journals as pdfs the article you re citing may have originally appeared in a print journal but you accessed it online you need to let the reader know how they too can access it online last first title of article title of journal volume issue year pages database web date of access the date of access is the date on which you found the essay in mla all dates follow this format date month year for example 15 july 2015 for example smith jane an essay about wikihow the journal of wikihow 13 2 2015 115 124 jstor 15 july 2015 apa is the formatting style for the american psychological association but it s used in the social sciences business and nursing as well just as you would for any paper check assignment sheets and submission guidelines to make sure apa is appropriate in apa though you must add a third element the year in which the essay was published a further difference from mla is that you include the in text citation wherever the cited information is whereas in mla the in text citation always goes at the end of the sentence in apa it can interrupt the sentence if you mention the author by name in the sentence the year appears in parentheses immediately after it for example morrow 1998 argues that quoted material p 54 the page number always appears immediately after the quoted or referenced material appears for example morrow 1998 argues that cats bring their owners dead squirrels out of spite p 54 though other research suggests the opposite if you don t name the author in the sentence put all three pieces of information in the parenthetical citation for example it may be argued that cats bring their owners dead squirrels out of spite morrow 1998 p 54 but it seems unlikely the order of information in the parenthetical always goes author year page the first essay will be considered a the second b and so on add this letter designation to the year in the in text citation to show which essay you re discussing imagine you have two essays by morrow titled a white christmas and summer in the south you want to cite the summer in the south essay the first major word of a white christmas is white so it comes after summer in the south on the reference list you would list the year for summer in the south as 2004a for example morrow argues that the heat contributes to the slowness of southern culture 2004a p 87 and it could well be true imagine that you have essays by morgan morrow and timothy morrow but you want to cite morgan s essay it could be argued that the heat contributes to the slowness of southern culture m morrow 2004a p 87 the reference list is a bibliography just like mla s works cited the entries on this list also depend on where the essay appears or how it s accessed essay found in a print anthology lastname

call it a works cited or reference list just like the notes bibliography entries are single spaced with a skipped line between entries but unlike the notes the first line is not indented while subsequent lines are indented essay found in a print anthology last first title in title case in anthology title in title case edited by first last city publisher year page range essay found in print

doi 10 1163 157006598x00125 just like in mla the chicago author date style inserts a parenthetical citation at the end of the sentence before the period but the information included in the parenthetical is more like apa author date and page number there is no punctuation between the author and date but the date and page number are separated by a comma the worldwide population of bees is in significant decline brown 2011 203 brown points out that the worldwide population of bees is in significant decline 2011 203 if you have multiple essays by the same author the reader should be able to distinguish them by the year you ve provided but if you have two articles by the same author and published in the same year you mark them with a letter like in apa the letter again corresponds with the alphabetization of the essay titles by first major word smith 2005a 192 the notes bibliography system does not require a bibliography but the date author system does like in mla or apa the reference list appears after the text of your essay has finished the first line of each entry is unindented while all subsequent lines are indented entries are listed in alphabetic order essay found

to write an email to your professor write a query letter via email use email to contact human resources if you do not already have an email address you will need to sign up with an email provider before proceeding thankfully there are many free web based email providers who you can get a free email address with for no cost some of the most popular ones include gmailhotmailyahoo mail before you can write an email you will need to open a new blank message box to write your email in the exact method varies depending on the service you use but there will usually be a button toward the top of the page with a label like compose new or new message if you are uncertain about how to create a new message check the help pages for your email service to learn more about it in greater detail you do not need to list your own email address but you do need to specify the email address of the person or people you intend to send the email to a space is often enough to separate multiple email addresses but some services do request that you separate multiple addresses with a comma or some other form of punctuation if this is the case these instructions should be specified by your specific email provider type the email address of the main receiver or receivers in the to field the main receiver usually refers to anyone whom the email is directly meant for or addressed to in the body of the email type other email addresses in the cc field this is the copy field a receiver should be listed in the cc field if the email does not directly mention them but does refer to something that individual should be aware of use the bcc field to hide email addresses if you do not want the receivers of an email to see a list of email addresses the message went to you should type those email addresses in the blind copy field every email service will let you type a subject or title for your email in the subject box the subject should be brief but it should also give the recipient some idea of what the email is about for example a casual email to a friend could simply say what s up if you are emailing with a question about an assignment though the subject line might read something like math homework similarly a question to a supervisor or professor could be labeled with a subject line like question or question about followed by a brief label describing the topic in question note that a message without a subject will appear in a recipient s inbox with the label of no subject the body of your email should be written in the large text box below the subject line the body of each email should typically include a salutation message and closing the nature of email is fast so you should generally keep the length of your message fairly short after you finish typing your email review it to verify that there are no spelling or grammar mistakes and that the message clearly addresses the matter you wanted to bring up if the email is ready hit the send button on the message box in order to send it away to the listed recipients friendly emails should be reserved for loved ones including friends family and romantic partners if the message is casual in nature and you are sending it to someone you are on informal terms with you can send a friendly email the only time you would not send a friendly email to a family or friend would be if you are sending a group email of an official nature like a plea for donations or sale advertisement since these emails will likely be sent to people who you are not on casual terms with as well you must gear the email toward them a subject line is not strictly essential but it is still a good idea to include a subject keep it short sweet and to the point if you are just writing an email to catch up with a friend you could include a humorous subject line or one as simple as long time no see if you are writing with a purpose mention what that purpose is for example if you decide to write an email about a group outing label the email with a subject that specifically mentions that outing for a friendly email this is not strictly necessary but it is still a polite way to begin the body of your message your salutation can be as simple as stating the person s name bob alternatively you can include a friendly greeting with that name as well hey bob hi bob morning bob the body of your message should be easy to understand but the tone should be informal and conversational read your email and ask yourself if the content of the email sounds like the way you speak in person if so then you ve achieved a good tone for a friendly email use contractions contractions are not a part of formal writing but they are a common part of everyday conversation making them appropriate for a friendly email feel free to use slang if desired you can include internet slang thx instead of thanks 4 instead of for l8r instead of later etc also use emoticons when appropriate like salutations a closing or signature is not strictly necessary for a friendly email but it can be a good way to end the message your closing can be as simple as your name jen jen you can also get a little more creative with your closing later jen this email will self destruct in 3 2 1 you should use a formal email when you are writing someone you are not on casual terms with this includes among others supervisors co workers clients and customers instructors and community or political officials note that you may find that strict formal emails are not necessary with someone who falls into one of these categories once you build a working relationship with that person when a formal email becomes a little too rigid you should write a semi formal email the tone of your message can be a little more conversational but you should stay away from internet slang you should still include your signature but you may not need to provide all of your contact information below your name the subject should be brief but accurate get straight to the matter at hand example essay question when writing an email to a professor asking for details about an essay assignment application for management job ad when sending an email in response to a job ad problem with part 00000 when typing an email to request customer service or to report a technical problem a formal salutation should include the word dear followed by the receiver s name use the receiver s last name and an appropriate title and follow the salutation with a colon example dear mr smith dear ms jones dear dr evans restrict the content of your email to a few paragraphs that directly address the subject of your email use formal language and make sure that your spelling and grammar are accurate avoid the use of contractions do not use internet slang or emoticons the most common closing is sincerely but there are a few others that can work as well keep the closing polite and follow it with a comma other possible closings include regardsyours faithfullybest regardsthank youbest wishes include your full name below the closing of your email below your name you may want to include your official title and any contact information that come in handy your title if you have one should include your position and the name of the company or institution you are a part of include your telephone number fax number and email address at minimum you may also wish to include your mailing address and website url if a friend relative or loved one has recently moved to a new location write an email to check in by asking about how the move went what the new neighborhood is like and so on if you got a casual friend s email address from a third party it is important that you use your email to verify that the address is correct and that you quickly clarify who you are if you re a girl writing an email to a guy for the first time you might feel a little unnerved this is especially true if the guy you re writing to is potential crush material try writing an email that seems casual yet intelligent and composed while it s a pretty risky move you can also use email to tell a guy you like him if you re a guy writing an email to a girl for the first time the task may seem pretty daunting keep your cool and write a message that is both casual and well put together if you want to be cute and playful with the recipient of your email use the same sort of language you would use to flirt with that person in reality emoticons and hugs and kisses xoxo also come in handy similarly write a flirty email to someone on an dating website for an email like this though you need to be both flirty and informative so that the recipient gets a good idea of who you are in this digital age the love email can be viewed as an equivalent of the love letter if your romantic partner is away and you want to send a quick note expressing your love email is the fastest way to do it when sending in your resume and job application via email you need to explain which job you are applying for why you want it and what qualifications you have that make you well suited for the job you should also include your resume as an attachment similarly you can also write an email applying for an internship describe what sort of internship you are looking for and how it will help you meet your career goals also provide reasons why you should be selected for the internship send a follow up email if you have not yet received a reply about the position you applied for emailing a professor may seem intimidating but it is no more difficult than any other formal email your professor is likely a busy person so keep your questions as concise as possible if your professor knows you well enough you can also email your professor when asking for a letter of recommendation a query letter is a letter asking an editor if he or she would consider accepting a work of writing for publication consideration you need to describe the work in question well enough to give the editor a good idea of what it is about if you have a human resources concern about your company the fastest way to address it is by sending an email to the correct people in hr make sure that the email clearly addresses the issue

query	66	sue your insurance company sometimes insurance companies do not act in the most upstanding manner if you have an insurance policy in place an event happens giving rise to a claim on that policy and the insurance company does not act as it is supposed to by denying your claim delaying payment paying you less than you are owed etc you may have to resort to litigation to get the money you deserve understanding on what grounds you can sue and the process for bringing the suit itself will help you if you find yourself in this frustrating situation understanding when you can sue your insurance company suing your insurance company taking your insurance company to court sue your insurance company if it unreasonably delays payment of your claim sue your insurance company if it tries to settle your claim for an unreasonably low amount of money sue your insurance company if it unreasonably denies your claim sue your insurance company for post claim underwriting sue your insurance company for failing to defend you in court understand your causes of action against your insurance company generally contact your insurance company obtain a copy of your signed insurance policy read your insurance policy thoroughly make sure your loss is covered under the terms of the contract compile an estimate of your losses research the insurance law of your state file a claim with your state s department of insurance hire an attorney file a complaint with the appropriate court engage in discovery participate in the pre trial conference go to trial insurance companies are in the business of making money the longer an insurance company takes to pay a claim 1 the longer it can hold on to the money it owes you and use that money for its own purposes and 2 you might find yourself in a position where you really need the money and therefore become willing to settle for less than the amount they should have paid you insurance companies are obligated to pay valid insurance claims in a timely manner if your insurance company has unreasonably delayed payment of your claim you can sue it in order to force it to pay the amount it owes you make sure to ask your insurance company for the reason it is delaying payment of your claim and ask them to put this reason into writing and send it to you you will need this as evidence later on once you make a claim you and your insurance company will engage in a negotiation process where the insurance company tries to talk you down from the amount you request to cover your losses while you may be able to reach an amount both of you agree on sometimes your insurance company will refuse to offer you anything but a small amount of money i e not enough to cover your loss and hope that you will take it instead of trying to fight the company over the amount if this is the case you can sue the insurance company because it is unwilling to cover your losses in a reasonable manner make sure to ask your claims adjuster for the reason the insurance company is only willing to pay you such a low amount and get this reason in writing you will need this later there are many tactics your insurance company might use in order to not pay your claim and many reasons it might give you for denying payment it might say that it was your fault you suffered a loss that your particular policy doesn t cover the exact circumstances of your loss that you didn t do enough to prevent the loss or simply that your claim is too high regardless of the reason it gives you if you feel that the reason it is denying your claim doesn t seem fair or that it is not rational you can sue your insurance company for denying your claim without a good justification for doing so make sure to have your insurance company give you the reason it is denying your claim in writing so you will have this for reference later on before an insurance company issues you a policy it engages in a process called underwriting by which it investigates you and your history to determine if it should offer you an insurance policy sometimes insurance companies will refuse to pay your claim on the basis that your policy should never have been issued in the first place because you were too great a risk to insure basically trying to underwrite you again after you suffer a loss making you a greater risk to the insurance company in order to avoid having to pay you it will then try to cancel your policy and use this as a basis for not paying an otherwise covered claim if your insurance company does this you can sue them because this type of behavior is not legitimate to recognize this type of behavior check to see which part of the insurance company is processing your claim the claims department or the underwriting department if it is the latter be on the lookout for your insurance company taking this type of action against you if your insurance company issues you a check refunding your premium payments because they are canceling your insurance do not cash this check doing so may be seen as accepting the insurance company s decision to cancel your insurance in light of a claim it does not want to pay in the liability portion of your insurance policy your insurance company protects you from certain damages sought in lawsuits against you this promise is often referred to as an insurance company s duty to defend when an insurance company has a duty to defend they will be required to hire legal counsel to represent you in covered claims it also includes a promise to cover all legal fees and costs if the damages being sought are at all covered by your insurance policy your insurance company will have this duty to defend if your insurance company fails to defend you when they were supposed to you may sue for bad faith and recoup the costs of defending yourself these costs could include attorneys fees for both defending yourself and suing the insurance company in law the cause of action is the formal way of stating that you have the right to file a lawsuit in light of a particular series of events in relation to insurance companies you will generally be bringing a lawsuit under one of three causes of action 1 breach of contract 2 violation of a consumer protection law or 3 a violation of bad faith law the above are examples of bad faith on the part of your insurance company which basically means that it did something wrong without any good reason for doing so if your insurance company has engaged in any of these activities this is the legal reason you will point to for bringing your lawsuit against your insurance company the majority of lawsuits against insurance companies are for these types of bad faith violations many of the above activities could also be considered a breach of contract meaning your insurance company has violated the terms of the insurance policy it offered you and on which you have been paying premiums these activities may also be considered a violation of federal or state consumer protection law which prevents businesses from engaging in unfair or deceptive business practices or from making fraudulent statements these laws vary by state but generally if your insurance company has made false statements to justify any of its actions you can bring your lawsuit on this ground as well your first step should always be to contact your insurance company to try to resolve your dispute before threatening litigation contact your insurance company and talk with your insurance agent to see if you can work the issue out on your own if your particular insurance agent or claims adjuster is unhelpful ask to speak to their supervisor ask why your claim was denied and get the reason in writing you will need this as evidence later if you intend to sue your insurance company you should have a copy of the insurance policy in question filed in your records with your other important documents if you do not have a copy or have somehow misplaced or lost it contact your insurance provider and request a copy of your insurance policy this is very important if you will be suing your insurance company because they violated the terms of your policy it is crucial that you understand exactly what your policy says pay particular attention to things like the proper process for submitting a claim how payment is handled and how disputes are resolved according the the contract make sure you have complied with your contractual obligations if you will be asserting that your insurance company has failed to follow through with its contractual duties you will want to be sure that they cannot make the same claim against you if your policy states the process by which you must submit a claim for example follow this process exactly insurance contracts are generally very specific about what is and is not covered as you are reading through your policy check to see if the facts surrounding your loss match with the types of loss your insurance company has contractually agreed to cover in your policy depending on the type of insurance you are dealing with you will want to make sure that you have evidence substantiating your claim acquire the necessary records bills receipts or photographs you will need to show you have a valid claim if you have spoken with your insurance company about your claim collect the records of these conversations written correspondence e mails etc so that you will be able to show you have taken steps to resolve your claim before resorting to litigation insurance law varies widely state to state and you will want to be sure that you are aware of what your state s laws say in relation to insurance claims before engaging in litigation there are many resources online dedicated to helping you understand the insurance laws of your state of residence read your state s laws thoroughly to get an understanding of the laws that will govern your lawsuit every state has a department dedicated to assisting consumers with regards to insurance claims and each has a website you can visit for more information or to file a complaint online after filing your claim you will need to provide whatever documents or evidence your state s insurance department may ask for the website for your state s department of insurance will also contain resources to help you understand your state s insurance law you should be aware that most state s insurance departments receive many claims each day and therefore you may have to wait a considerable amount of time before your dispute is finally resolved if you want quicker results consider hiring an attorney if you do hire an attorney some states insurance departments will wait until your attorney has litigated your case before intervening insurance law is very complicated and you might not have the easiest time researching and understanding it on your own you also might be too busy to sit down for hours to read through long lists of statutes while your state s department of insurance will certainly help you the fastest way to get your claim resolved is to hire a local attorney specializing in insurance law attorneys often accept insurance cases on a contingency fee basis meaning they will take a portion of the money you are awarded if you win as payment instead of you paying them up front you will be charged nothing if you lose your case the attorney will also be able to sit down with you and discuss the issues of your particular case to determine the best way to handle your denied claim many attorneys offer free consultation so don t be afraid to take advantage of this and talk through the facts of your case with someone who specializes in your state s insurance laws your attorney will take care of the lawsuit as it progresses and will contact you as needed for more information the first step of any lawsuit is filing a complaint with the appropriate court since insurance law is based mostly on state law it is likely you will be in the state trial court for the county in which you live your attorney will submit a document to the court stating your case in broad terms the basic facts surrounding the dispute and your cause of action for bringing the lawsuit which will probably be bad faith on the part of the insurance company your insurance company will file an answer to this complaint and your attorney will receive a copy from this document you will be able to get a general idea of what your insurance company s position is after your complaint is filed and the insurance company has responded the process known as discovery will begin basically this process which happens before trial allows each side to get a sense of the strengths and weaknesses of each side s case to determine if the case should be settled or if it would be better to go to trial and argue in front of a judge and jury this is where your written correspondence with the insurance company will come in handy if you don t have certain information about your case that you think the insurance company has in its records this is the time to ask for this information the insurance company will also ask you for certain records and documents which you must produce during this process the insurance company might depose you which means that it meets with you and your lawyer in an official setting to ask you questions pertaining to your case most cases are settled in this stage if you have a valid claim and your insurance company sees that you are willing to take legal action to protect your interests it will likely offer to settle your case with you to save itself the expense of trial if the discovery process has concluded and no settlement has been reached you your lawyer the insurance company and its lawyers will all meet before a judge to discuss certain issues before the trial begins that will speed up the trial process going forward these will be things like the rules for admitting certain types of evidence which issues the parties agree upon and the like on the day your case is set for trial you your attorney your insurance company and its attorneys will appear in court to argue your case your attorney will present the facts of your case against the insurance company and the insurance company will try to argue why it has not broken the law you will probably be called on to testify at trial so be sure to be consistent with the facts of your case tell the truth and remain calm and relaxed going to trial can be a stressful process but if you have a valid claim and the documentation to back it up you will likely receive a verdict in your favor

keeping the voile curtain closed to soften the light and offer a minimal amount of privacy the heavier curtain is then drawn closed again in the evening you can find voile curtains in a range of colors and patterns pick out the style that coordinates best with the look of your room the most traditional voile curtains tend to be white or off white but nowadays these curtains are available in a range of soft pastel colors if plain voile is too drab for your tastes look for voile curtains with a soft print floral motifs are common but you can also find voile with stripes dots or other abstract patterns also pay attention to how that particular voile curtain is supposed to hang most voile curtains use net pleat tape which is the most adjustable and versatile option other options include tab tops and ring tops eyelets measure the width of the window voile curtains should measure two to three times wider than your measured window width you ll also need to consider the curtain length measure the height of the window from top to bottom to get a base figure a curtain rod is usually placed 6 inches 15 24 cm above the top of the window so add this value to the base figure the curtain can either fall to the floor or to the windowsill there should be no more than 1 2 inch 1 25 cm difference between the end floor windowsill and the bottom of the voile subtract this value from the current calculated height the solution should tell you how long the voile needs to be note that most curtains come in standard sizes so you may not find voile curtains in the exact length and width you calculated select the next nearest size if you run into this problem measure the width of the window again you will need to gather the voile until the width of the curtain roughly matches the width of the window the width of the curtains can extend slightly past the width of the window if desired but the total width of the gathered voile should be no more than 1 foot 30 cm longer than the width of the window using curtains that are slightly larger can make the window appear larger thereby making the room seem lighter and more open there should be two drawstrings hanging from one side of the netpleat tape at the top of the curtain pull these drawstrings outward until the voile shortens to the appropriate width if you need the voile to be wider pull more of the material over the attached drawstrings note that one drawstring should be at the top of the net pleat while the other should be at the bottom of the strip also note that the gathering and pleating only applies to voile with netpleat tape if you are using tab tops or ring tops skip directly to the hang the voile with a curtain rod section as you adjusted the width of the voile pleats should have formed in the material use your hands to rearrange these pleats as needed until they are all even in size and distance make sure that you do not accidentally change the overall width of the voile as you adjust the pleats do not cut off the drawstrings after adjusting the pleats these drawstrings should remain intact permanently the tension rod will need to be placed in between two facing surfaces measure the distance between those two surfaces and select a tension rod that can extend or shrink to that length if the window is recessed into the wall the two facing surfaces will be the vertical sides of the window frame if the entire window area is recessed into a small room nook the two facing surfaces might be the two facing walls on either side of the window note that this method will only work if you have voile with a netpleat strip if your voile only has tab tops or ring tops you will need to follow the hang the voile with a curtain rod section adjust the length of the tension rod so that it is approximately the same as the width of your window recess the length of the rod should actually be slightly smaller this will enable you to wedge the rod in place within the recess to adjust the length locate the spot where the two interlocking shafts meet and place one hand on either side of that position twist counterclockwise to make the rod longer or clockwise to shorten it find the raised transparent loops along the back of the netpleat tape slide the tension rod through each of these loops work slowly to ensure that each loop is caught around the tension rod the length of the tension rod might be larger than the width of the voile in this case simply make sure that the voile is centered along the rod so that it falls in front of the window when placed put the tension rod in place at the top of your window recess twist counterclockwise to lengthen the rod slightly and create pressure on either side once you think the rod is firmly in place test it by applying pressure to one side the tension rod should not budge this completes the process insert standard curtain hooks along the top of the voile using the pockets or holes provided if using voile with netpleat tape you should insert the hooks at even intervals into the white pockets along the top of the strip if using voile with tap tops insert a hook into each loop sewn into the top of the curtain for voile with ring tops simply insert a hook into each of the open gaps along the top of the voile the curtain rod should be wide enough for the window and suitable for use with voile insert the rod through the hooks one at a time until all of them are in place if you re hanging the voile by itself simply slide a standard curtain rod through the hooks if you re hanging the voile with a second curtain try using a double curtain rod this type of curtain rod will allow you to open and close each curtain separately the length of the curtain rod itself should roughly match the width of the gathered voile but the rod can be a little longer if necessary avoid using a curtain rod that is too short also note that you should only take the length of the rod itself into consideration here not the combined length of the rod and its brackets use a pencil to lightly mark where the curtain rod brackets will need to be on the wall above the window keep in mind that the ideal placement for a curtain rod is about 6 inches 15 24 cm above the window the rod will need to be centered above the window there should be an even amount of excess overhang on either side of the window for instance if the combined length of the rod and its brackets are 1 foot 30 5 cm longer than the width of the window the rod should extend 6 inches 15 24 cm past either side of the window use a tape measure and a level to make sure that your measurements are as accurate as possible measure two or three times to reduce the risk of error use a power drill or screwdriver to twist the screws partially into the wall once roughly 1 inch 2 5 cm has been inserted into the wall remove the screw again do not use the brackets during this step creating a pilot hole is a good way to carefully start the process of screwing something heavy into the wall this step can help prevent the screws from cracking the wall as you install the curtain rod position the curtain rod brackets onto the wall so that the screw holes line up with the anchor holes use a screwdriver or power drill to carefully insert screws through the bracket holes and into the wall if you are installing the brackets in between studs in the wall you many need to use plastic screw anchors instead of standard screws anchor screws can also be a good idea if you are using a heavy double curtain rod insert either end of the curtain rod into its corresponding bracket if done correctly the curtain rod should rest securely inside both brackets and the voile should hang evenly if you are hanging double curtains you will need to make sure that both curtains are on the rod before you install it the voile curtain should be the one closest to the window the conclusion of this step completes the process 
query	68	start a home church home churches are small gatherings of likeminded religious people in an individual s home people meet for prayer study of religious scripture and other rituals home churches are started for a variety of reasons you may be unable to find a church that meets your needs in your area for example or prefer a smaller congregation to start a home church you must first establish the basics think about the kind of services you want to provide gather members slowly start with friends and family members and go from there create regular meetings that include customs that meet the needs of your congregation establishing the basics gathering members having regular meetings and services choose the right house for your church examine your motivations for starting a home church seek guidance from local spiritual leaders choose three or four main leaders start off with studying religious doctrine at home seek sponsorship from an existing church think about the people you want to reach start with a small group keep the size manageable meet at least once a week read and discuss doctrine pray for one another consider traditional and creative worship elements while you may assume your home will be the place for your home church this is not always the best idea a home church should ideally be based in an area without any established churches nearby or where nearby churches are bigger and less intimate many people prefer smaller services which is why they may seek out home churches you should also pick an area that would be easy for potential members to reach such as a home found in a central location in a city or town networking with other people with similar religious beliefs is important when starting a home church this way if your home is not appropriate for a home church you can try finding someone else to volunteer you want to make sure you re starting a home church for the right reasons a home church should be a collaborative environment where likeminded people come together to worship home churches are usually started if there are few established churches in an area or if existing churches are not meeting the needs of many people the following reasons are valid reasons to start a home church if existing churches have turned many people away it may be necessary to start a home church if churches in your area are very large many people prefer the intimacy provided by a home church if there are many people in your existing church who dislike the way doctrine is taught you may find a home church can help no one can start a home church without guidance existing spiritual leaders in your community are there to help reach out to spiritual leaders in your area whose beliefs are roughly in line with yours let them know you re planning on starting a home church and ask for support and suggestions look for established believers in your area that are known for their religious services for example if you re starting a christian home church talk to someone who runs a christian based charity and ask them for guidance if you do seek guidance within an existing church make it clear you re not trying to challenge or upend that church explain that your motivations are simply to create a smaller more intimate setting that is unlikely to replace an existing church home churches usually benefit from having a backbone of leaders just like elders or vestry in an established church gather a group of three to four individuals to serve as leaders leaders can be family members members of your existing church or spiritual leaders in your community depending on the precise plan for your church leaders can have different roles for example if you intend to have sermons choose someone who is articulate and well versed in your religion s doctrine to give sermons many home churches begin by studying religious doctrine with likeminded church goers studying doctrine can be a good way to gauge whether your congregation works well together study doctrine from your religion when you first start meeting with potential members of your home church to establish spiritual beliefs as an organization most religious doctrine is subject to a variety of interpretations studying doctrine together can help you get a feel for your church s spiritual beliefs and values find common beliefs to draw from as you form a church schedule a regular meeting time for low key readings and discussions do not appoint a lot of leaders or establish a budget let everyone get comfortable with one another first existing churches may want to help out a home church home churches are not necessarily seen as a threat or a challenge to existing religious institutions established churches will be understanding if a home church exists because certain people have trouble attending regular church services for a variety of reasons consider approaching a church for sponsorship choose a church that you respect and whose beliefs align with your own part of the benefit of a sponsoring church is that you have a higher authority to draw judgment from in a home church strong personalities can take over and guide your church in unwanted directions a sponsoring church can help your congregation stay grounded schedule a time to visit with the leader of the church you choose have a sit down meeting and explain your reasons for wanting to start a home church tell them you want a sponsoring church to guide you in your early days of leadership as you start to gather members think about why you started a home church to begin with draw in people with similar beliefs from your religious community at first many people may come and go from your home church out of curiosity learn to figure out which people fit in with your church s goals and values and reach out to them specifically to grow your congregation for example say you started a home church because the existing church in your area is difficult for many to reach look for people who frequently miss services due to difficulties with their commute these people s needs would be met through your home church choose sincere believers who have a genuine need for a home church many people like the idea of a home church because it seems fun and trendy make sure your members want to be part of a home church because you re providing them a specific spiritual experience a home church does not need to start off with a huge congregation in fact most home churches start with only a few loyal members try starting out with a casual gathering of friends and family members who share your basic religious beliefs from there let the church grow organically as word spreads many home churches are designed to provide the intimacy larger churches lack it s important to keep the size of your home church manageable especially if you re using a smaller home for your church honestly assess how many people can fit into your home church considering the space you have and the needs of your members for example maybe you and your congregation are only comfortable with groups of around 10 to 20 people once you have roughly 10 to 20 regular churchgoers it s okay to taper off seeking new members most home churches have small congregations if you have a lot of members more than one home church may crop up in the area do not think of this as a challenge or threat to your church remind yourself people prefer home churches due to the intimacy and if you re at capacity there may be a need for more home churches in your area regular meetings are key to keep a home church going strong find a weekly meeting time that works for everyone the advantage of a home church is that you do not have to meet on traditional worship days especially if some members are unavailable on those days if the time works for everyone there is no reason a home church cannot meet on say a tuesday night in the early days of your church you may have to play around with time a little before finding the right time for services try reading a section of religious doctrine each week afterwards have a brief discussion about what the piece means and how to incorporate its lessons into your life part of the appeal of a home church is the increased intimacy therefore allow everyone to participate equally in the discussion it can be helpful to have someone particularly knowledgable of your religion s doctrine lead the lecture for example say someone who majored in religious studies in college is part of your church have them lead the discussion to foster a sense of community reserve part of your services for praying for one another the method you choose to do this is up to you and your congregation some people prefer silent prayer while others would prefer to have someone lead them in a general prayer for one another talk it over with your congregation to find a method of praying for each other that works you can also say a general prayer for those around you that are in need you can for example close with an invitation for people to pray silently for those in need in their lives a home church provides a lot of flexibility for members you do not have to stick to traditional forms of worship talk to members of your church and think about any traditional and non traditional elements you want to include things like confession the recitation of certain prayers or singing particular songs may be part of your religious traditions talk to your members about what traditional worship elements work for your home church you do not have to stick strictly to the traditional however ask your members what creative forms of worship interest them some people may want to experiment with things like meditation religious dance or other less conventional forms of worship 
query	69	create a joint venture a joint venture is a strategic alliance or partnership between two or more parties that allows both parties usually companies to increase their ability to build their separate businesses joint ventures are commonly used by companies to become active in a new territory and return higher profits by expanding the company s network if you have a company that wants to grow in this way you need to research and define your needs seek out a viable partner and then carefully draft a joint venture agreement contract that will build a strong partnership planning for a joint venture deciding the format of your joint venture drafting the joint venture agreement determine your need for a joint venture define your business objective research potential joint venture partners network with other companies schedule follow up meetings determine if the two companies are a good fit a successful joint venture depends on more than just completing a task prepare a nondisclosure agreement draft a letter of intent review the scope of the overall undertaking create a new corporation if the project is large form a partnership if you wish to retain individual identities draft a contract for a smaller or temporary project introduce the purpose of the joint venture and the parties define relevant terms identify the business objectives of the joint venture define the structure of the joint venture define the management of the joint venture address financial issues related to the joint venture define the role of employees in the joint venture agree on a procedure for resolving any controversies or disagreements define the duration and or termination procedures include a confidentiality clause conclude the agreement with signatures in your regular business operations you may reach a point when you have the need for expertise technology or operations that your business is lacking one way to solve this is through a joint venture with another company that has expertise or operations in that area for example your company may focus on research and development of a new product but you do not have the resources for distribution you could form a joint venture with another company to share in the marketing and distribution of your product once you have an idea you need to state it clearly in objective business terms describe the purpose of the joint venture that you foresee and identify its goals this will need to be a document that you can share with potential partners to generate interest the need for the joint venture should be compelling and self evident in order to catch the attention of other companies networking in the business community is a useful way to find potential partners shop around meet with other business leaders and focus on companies that provide the services or have the expertise that you need attending conferences and networking events in the business areas in which you want to find a strategic partner will give you a better idea of who your potential partners are and what you have to offer each other networking events allow you to informally meet and exchange business cards which gives you the opportunity to follow up with those individuals whose companies meet your needs after you have met a number of people by networking schedule follow up meetings with those people that you are most interested in working with be prepared to discuss the needs of your business as well as what your business has to offer the other company you need to examine the operating structures of the two companies to see if they are compatible consider the following issues in making this decision are the management structures of the two companies compatible are the employees of each company receptive and supportive of the joint venture are the two companies similarly if not equally committed to the success of the joint venture are both companies financially secure enough to support the joint venture do the two companies trust each other enough to work well together for a joint venture to be successful the two companies will need to deal openly with each other and sometimes this means sharing otherwise confidential information you may choose to prepare a nondisclosure or confidentiality agreement before you begin the joint venture this is a form of a contract by which both parties agree not to disclose or take advantage of anything obtained from the other company after the groundwork has been laid a letter of intent is often the precursor to the formal joint venture agreement a letter of intent explains the general purpose of the joint venture and indicates each party s intent to negotiate the final terms of the agreement a letter of intent may be either a binding or a non binding agreement a binding letter of intent becomes a contract that sets forth certain rules that the parties will follow in negotiating the joint venture agreement it will include all key terms to the deal and should address arbitration or some other method of resolving disputes that may arise a non binding letter of intent defines the expected joint venture and spells out the intentions of each party to negotiate the final agreement there are different forms that a joint venture can take depending on the size of the project that you have in mind you and your partnering company should review the purpose of the joint venture and its expected duration and then use that information to select your future course of action the various forms of a joint venture may be a new corporation a partnership or a simple contractual agreement if the joint venture is something that you expect will last and perhaps grow even larger you may decide to create a stand alone corporation to be owned equally or in whatever proportions you choose by the two joint venture partners the newly formed corporation will need its own identity officers and employees although there may be significant overlap with the original companies a joint venture can be a partnership whereby the two original companies each retain their original identity the joint venture agreement becomes a partnership agreement that will define how the partners will share liabilities and responsibilities if the joint venture is seen as a sort of one time deal then it may be best just to draft a joint venture agreement the two companies retain their individual identities and just agree to join their resources and expertise for a specific purpose most contracts begin by naming the parties to the agreement with a brief description of each party s operations then introduce the name of the new joint venture and a include a brief statement of its intended purpose the purpose is often stated early in the joint venture agreement the parties to this agreement a and b are joining together to the statement does not need to be particularly exciting just say what you are doing if there are particular terms of art or specific issues that are key to the joint venture they should be clearly defined this section may begin with a heading that actually says definitions to set it apart from the agreement portion of the contract this term will clearly state the purpose of the joint venture to help keep the parties focused as the project moves forward you want to make your statement of the objective clear and defined so that the parties to the contract can identify when their task has been met this will be the section of the contract that identifies the format you have selected the parties to the joint venture need to discuss whether they will be creating some new business entity or remaining as independent agents working together if you are forming a new corporation this section will identify that new corporation its operating structure officers etc if you are forming a partnership you need to define how the partnership will share assets and liabilities if the parties to the joint venture are retaining their independent identities but just joining forces through this contract you still need to say something to that effect each party to this joint venture agreement will remain independently responsible for its ongoing costs and expenses income from the joint venture will be shared equally and each party will retain complete independence for tax purposes for the joint venture to succeed the parties need to agree how they will run the operation you need to decide if you will create a separate board of directors elect officers or set up a team of representatives in this section you should address the following the structure of the managementprocedures for appointing or selecting the managerscompensation or fees for the managersmanagement s decision making responsibilities or limitationsfrequency and purpose of meetings you need to explain what each party will contribute to the joint venture in terms of cash or other resources you also need to define how the profits will be shared some considerations include when profits will be paid outhow profits are to be calculatedwhat share of profits each party will receivehow tax obligations will be shared and reported you will need to consider which company will contribute workers to the joint venture and in what proportions the agreement needs to identify which employees will perform specific functions and how the work of the joint venture will get done it is important in any joint venture that the parties anticipate the possibility of future disputes the joint venture agreement needs to provide procedures that the parties will follow to resolve these problems good faith negotiation the first step should always be for the two parties to try to resolve any dispute between themselves mediation mediation is a system of guided negotiation a neutral party is brought in to meet with each side and help guide discussions to bring about a resolution arbitration arbitration may be binding or non binding this is a sort of trial and can sometimes be costly depending on the scope of the dispute the parties agree to a set of procedures such as the american arbitration association rules and agree to present their dispute to a neutral third party who will make a decision choice of law it is important to identify which state s laws will govern any dispute particularly if the joint venture is large and the parties are from different states costs dispute resolution can be costly it is important to define up front who will bear the costs whether they will be split evenly or paid for by the party raising the dispute by its definition a joint venture is usually temporary you can define it either by a specified length of time or by clearly stating the business objective so that when the objective is reached the joint venture will be concluded as part of this section you may want to include the following a clear definition of the completion of the joint venture project for example a joint venture agreement between a marketing firm and an architectural firm might read this joint venture agreement remains in full force until the building project has been completed and 100 of the ownership shares have been sold a date when the project is to end alternatively the parties could set a specific target date to terminate the joint venture this would read this joint venture agreement remains in full force until may 1 2018 unless the parties by agreement execute an amendment for a later or earlier date the possibility of ending the joint venture if it becomes clear that the project is not succeeding in this case you need to define clearly what not succeeding means and whether the parties must agree or if either party may make this decision consider periodic reviews you may want to define a review team that will meet periodically weekly monthly annually depending on the scope of the project to determine whether the objectives of the joint venture are being met and whether termination should be considered if the parties executed a nondisclosure or confidentiality agreement at the outset of the joint venture then the formal joint venture agreement may incorporate that document by reference or may repeat similar terms incorporation by reference would say something like the nondisclosure agreement executed by the parties and dated is hereby incorporated in its entirety and shall continue in effect for the duration of this joint venture agreement the joint venture agreement must be signed by representatives of each party with authority to enter into the contract each party or its attorney should keep a copy of the final agreement

acupuncturist accepts insurance meet with the licensed acupuncturist consider the specialty of the licensed acupuncturist be patient with your search most individual u s states regulate acupuncture licensing but these states typically work with the national certification commission for acupuncture and oriental medicine nccaom to determine eligibility for licensure nccaom is the only nationally recognized certification granted to acupuncturists but having the certification does not necessarily mean someone is a licensed acupuncturist acupuncturists are usually required to pass nccaom exams to be licensed but in addition to this exam the specific state the acupuncturist will be practicing in might have additional licensure requirements currently 43 u s states as well as the district of columbia work with the nccaom to assess and regulate acupuncture licensure california administers its own exam the california licensing examination to grant licensure to acupuncturists licensed acupuncturists attend and graduate from nationally accredited colleges of acupuncture this education is usually at a master s level takes 3 to 4 years to complete and is supervised by experienced and qualified acupuncturists acupuncturists to become licensed the national certification commission for acupuncture and oriental medicine requires that applicants attend a program accredited by the accreditation commission for acupuncture and oriental medicine acaom there are about 60 of these accredited programs in the u s to maintain their license acupuncturists must also complete continuing education courses even after completing coursework and graduating from a program most states also require that applicants for licensure pass nccaom certification exams on topics such as acupuncture with point location chinese herbology and oriental medicine state requirements vary as to which nccaom exams or how many different nccaom exams a person must pass before being granted licensure in addition to taking courses at an accredited college of acupuncture acupuncturists must complete extensive hands on training before they are granted licenses to practice licensed acupuncturists complete at least 1500 to 2000 hours of training as part of their educational program before being granted licensure acupuncturists are required to have seen and treated at least 250 actual patients when trying to locate a licensed acupuncturist you might encounter medical professionals who perform acupuncture or claim they are certified in acupuncture this designation is often used by physicians chiropractors physical therapists and dentists who employ acupuncture techniques in their fields but this does not necessarily mean they have the level of training and experience as licensed acupuncturists in comparison to licensed acupuncturists individuals claiming they are certified in acupuncture usually complete 100 to 300 hours of training the certification is typically granted by a professional organization in the individual s field such as the american academy of medical acupuncture the national acupuncture detoxification association or the international veterinary acupuncture society certified acupuncturists are not required to pass nccaom exams certified acupuncturists often do not have as much hands on experience with patients before being granted certification certified acupuncturists are not required to complete continuing education courses regulations on acupuncture licensing vary among states before you start looking for a licensed acupuncturist familiarize yourself with the specific requirements in your area the nccaom maintains a database of these requirements which is available through their website one of the easiest ways to locate a licensed acupuncturist in your area is to use the search engine or registry provided on the national certification commission for acupuncture oriental medicine nccaom website keep in mind that the nccaom registry only includes practitioners who elect to make their information available through the registry this means that it is possible for an acupuncturist to be licensed but not appear in the registry if someone you know recommended a specific acupuncturist you can use the nccaom website to verify their licensure or contact the organization by phone or email to confirm they are licensed your physician has likely referred patients to a licensed acupuncturists in the past and should be able to recommend one even if you receive a recommendation from your physician or another medical professional it s a good idea to use the other steps in this article to verify the individual is a licensed acupuncturist and make sure their licensing is up to date an acupuncturist may be certified through the national certification commission for acupuncture and oriental medicine but not licensed through the state they are located in as a result it s a good idea to contact your state s acupuncture board to verify whether an acupuncturist is licensed to practice in your area another helpful way to find a licensed acupuncturist is to research patient ratings and reviews online these will often provide insight into whether an acupuncturist is licensed but also provide you with invaluable information about their bedside manner and skills contact an organization like the better business bureau either online or by phone to see how other patients rate this acupuncturist while patient reviews can be helpful don t rely on them exclusively instead use them in conjunction with the other methods discussed in the article so you can be confident that someone is a licensed acupuncturist to get a more detailed review of a licensed acupuncturist ask the office for a current or past patient referral many offices are prepared for these requests and will try to provide the contact information of a patient with a condition similar to yours that the acupuncturist treated if the office declines the request because of privacy concerns don t be alarmed you want to work with an acupuncturist who is professional and will respect patient privacy before you schedule an appointment or procedure with a specific acupuncturist verify again that the acupuncturist is board certified by the nccaom and that their certification and license are up to date your state s acupuncture board or the acupuncturists office should have no problem confirming this information not all insurance providers cover acupuncture treatments and not all acupuncturists accept insurance so talk with your insurance provider and the acupuncturists office staff before setting up an appointment these details might influence which licensed acupuncturist you ultimately decide to work with so here are a few questions to ask in advance how many treatments will the insurance carrier provide what will your copay for a visit to a licensed acupuncturist be does the insurance company require a referral from a physician what conditions are covered for acupuncture some insurance companies only cover acupuncture for pain relief does the insurance provider have specific requirements about who can provide the acupuncture how will the acupuncturist deal with insurance for example they might want to be paid in full up front and recommend that you file a claim for reimbursement with your insurance provider on your own it s important to meet with the acupuncture practitioner you are thinking of working with before proceeding with any treatment this will provide you with another opportunity to verify that they have appropriate credentials but also give you a chance to assess whether you feel comfortable working with this individual if you don t want to schedule a formal appointment at this stage contact the office and see if there is a time you might be available to meet with the acupuncturist for a few minutes if you schedule a more formal initial visit ask the acupuncturist about the steps involved in treatment how much relief you might expect it to provide and how much it would cost though all licensed acupuncturists are required to understand general practice some specialize in certain fields such as fertility or dermatology if you would like to work with an acupuncturist who specializes in a specific field take this into consideration when researching licensed acupuncturists if the acupuncturist has a website or is featured on one their online profile might describe his or her areas of interest or specialty if you re uncertain whether you need a specialist you can always see a general acupuncturist first and discuss whether your treatment requires a specialist like with any medical professional it can take time to find the right acupuncturist for you and your needs if you are not comfortable with the practitioner you selected or have concerns that the treatment is not working you can reconsider your options and get a second opinion from a different licensed acupuncturist or other medical professional 
query	72	deal with sleep apnea more than 18 million people in the unites states suffer from some form of sleep apnea 1 the two primary forms of sleep apnea include central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea the majority of people suffer from obstructive apnea diagnosis is simple but inconvenient as most people will be need to undergo a sleep study to confirm the diagnosis and severity of the apnea once diagnosed the available treatment options are effective and often do not require the use of any medications differentiating obstructive sleep apnea from central sleep apnea treating your sleep apnea with lifestyle changes treating your apnea with cpap equipment considering risk factors and complications recognize the cause of obstructive sleep apnea recognize the symptoms identify the causes of central sleep apnea note the symptoms of central sleep apnea implement lifestyle changes avoid alcohol use especially daily or excessive use stop smoking lose weight review your medications with your doctor sleep on your side keep your nasal passages open see your dentist take steps to correct the underlying problem clarify your diagnosis proceed with cpap treatment select the mask that suits your needs adjust the fit get accustomed to cpap wear the mask every night keep your unit clean address any problems consider surgery become familiar with risk factors related to obstructive apnea recognize risk factors of central sleep apnea realize the complications of both types of sleep apnea obstructive sleep apnea is far more common than central apnea and is most often caused by direct interference with the passage of air when your throat muscles relax resulting in interrupted breathing the muscles in your throat support structures in your mouth and throat that normally remain open to let air pass through even when you are sleeping the structures supported by the muscles in your throat include the soft palate the uvula the tonsils and the tongue when the throat muscles relax too much as you fall asleep your air passages are blocked this causes a 10 to 20 second lapse of time when the level of oxygen in your blood is inadequate for the amount your brain needs your brain wakes you up briefly in order to restore the passage of air in many cases the person does not remember waking up this can occur as often as 5 to 30 times every hour or even more and continues throughout the night some symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea may overlap with those of central apnea in most people the cause of the problem clearly indicates one of the two possible types common symptoms that occur with obstructive sleep apnea include the following excessive daytime sleepiness that may cause you to fall asleep at work while watching television and have trouble staying awake to drive loud snoring often loud enough to disturb the sleep of others and is the loudest when you are positioned on your back observed episodes of periods of time when breathing stops waking up suddenly with a feeling of shortness of breath often accompanied by a snorting choking or gasping sound waking up with a headache and or chest pain difficulty concentrating during the day moodiness or noticeable changes in mood problems with insomnia such as being able to stay asleep at night having high blood pressure while the symptoms are similar the underlying possible causes of central sleep apnea are different central sleep apnea occurs when the brain sends faulty signals to the muscles responsible for regulating your breathing central sleep apnea is much less common than obstructive sleep apnea and is usually related to another medical condition the most common causes for central sleep apnea are medical problems associated with serious cardiovascular problems such as heart failure disorders that involve abnormal functioning of your brainstem or a history of a stroke some medications used repeatedly or in large doses can cause this type of sleep apnea opiates are the most common medications tied to causing central sleep apnea as they send messages to the brain that disrupt and slow normal breathing patterns opiates that have been associated with central sleep apnea include morphine oxycodone and codeine while the symptoms are similar and overlap with those of obstructive apnea there are some differences symptoms associated with central sleep apnea include the following shortness of breath that wakes you from sleep shortness of breath that is relieved by changing your position to sitting upright observed periods of abnormal breathing including periods when you stop breathing while you are sleeping difficulty staying asleep often considered to be insomnia excessive daytime sleepiness that may cause you to fall asleep at work watching television or even driving daytime evidence of poor sleep including difficulty concentrating morning headaches and mood changes snoring although snoring is also a symptom of obstructive apnea it can also be unrelated to apnea treatment options often begin with adjusting factors that may be within your control seek medical attention to confirm your diagnosis and get support for the important lifestyle adjustments you can alter to help treat your apnea alcohol significantly slows your rate of breathing this causes the amount of oxygen that is available in your blood to be lower than normal when you experience symptoms associated with sleep apnea you want as much oxygen as possible to reach your brain do not consume alcohol within four hours of your bedtime people that smoke will have more trouble with their air flow and airway passages talk to your doctor if you need help to stop smoking products are available both over the counter and by prescription that can help you successfully quit smoking if you are overweight or obese this may be the primary cause of your sleep apnea take steps to manage your weight in order to control your symptoms talk to your doctor if you need help with weight loss prescription products may help plus your doctor can connect you with a nutritionist and possibly an exercise therapist to help you as you work towards your weight loss goal be sure you doctor is aware of the problems you having with your sleep apnea with your doctor s help your routine medications can be adjusted to prevent them from aggravating your condition or causing problems try to avoid sleeping on your back use extra bed pillows to provide support against your back and help prevent you from rolling onto your back during your sleep special pillows are available to help you rest comfortably while providing support to help you sleep on your side when you are congested or your nasal passages are blocked this causes you to breathe through your mouth at night possibly triggering or worsening the apnea talk to your doctor about the safest and most effective way to keep your nasal passages open at night over the counter products including some that do not contain any medication such as breathing strips are available other products like saline nasal sprays or neti pots may work well for you to help your nasal passages stay clear at night custom fitted mouth devices are available specifically for sleep apnea the devices are made to fit in your mouth to keep your lower jaw and tongue in a position that keeps your airway passages open so you can breathe at night this type of device may or may not correct the type of problem you have that is causing your apnea so talk to your doctor first to determine if this may be helpful with the help of your doctor you may be able to pinpoint the exact cause of your apnea for example if you know that your tonsils are enlarged and are causing your apnea then talk to your doctor about possible procedures to correct the problem in people that are suffering from central sleep apnea caused by cardiovascular issues working closely with the cardiologist to address and correct those problems can help to reduce the symptoms of their apnea the same is true for people with diabetes taking good care of your diabetes including steps to control weight management can help to manage the sleep apnea symptoms to proceed with apnea treatment using cpap equipment which stands for continuous positive airway pressure your diagnosis will likely need to be confirmed the method used to diagnose sleep apnea is a polysomnography test most commonly referred to as a sleep study this is inconvenient but necessary to confirm the diagnosis determine the severity of your apnea and is usually required to support the diagnosis by your insurance company so they will assist in paying for the equipment once you have completed your sleep study your doctor will explain the differences in the available equipment a cpap unit provides a steady stream of air with enough pressure to prevent the tissues in your mouth and throat area from closing or collapsing as you sleep most units deliver a constant flow of air at the desired pressure level which is adjustable and indicated on the machine a newer method of delivering air pressure is called autotitrating positive airway pressure or apap this type of unit adjusts automatically to the different breathing patterns of the person throughout the night many people describe the apap equipment as being easier to get accustomed to and easier to tolerate some units available are called bilevel positive airway pressure or bpap this type of unit is designed to deliver one level of pressure when the person is inhaling and another pressure level when exhaling the most common cpap unit weights about 3 pounds has a tube that connects to the mask and is compact enough to sit on your bedside table the units have adjustable levels of pressure so you can begin with a small amount of pressure as you get used to the equipment then gradually increase the pressure to the level your doctor recommended masks are available in different styles and sizes some masks fit just over the nose and others are designed to fit over the mouth and nose try on several to determine the size and style that is most comfortable to you be sure the doctor or technician shows you how to adjust the fit of your mask a mask that fits poorly can cause skin irritation sores and may not function as it is intended it may be helpful to wear the mask for a few hours during the day without being attached to the actual unit start with wearing the mask for fewer hours each night if you have trouble adjusting to it work towards keeping the mask in place with the unit on for the duration of your sleep time start with lower levels of pressure and gradually increase to reach the amount of pressure your doctor recommended your sleep apnea is not being treated if you do not wear the mask with the appropriate amount of pressure it is important that you wear your mask every night additionally it is very important that you give yourself a 1 to 3 month time frame to become used to wearing the mask every night if you wake up and find you have removed your mask or headgear put it back on and continue to sleep this is an imperative part of creating the habit of sleeping properly with your cpap consider that more than 80 of sleep apnea sufferers discontinue using their cpap within the first year due to not forcing themselves to create the habit of wearing the cpap mask unfortunately they may not realize the dire health consequences they could be facing such as a heart attack by not making this important life change wear the mask for at least 6 to 7 hours each night for the best results most masks are designed with convenient travel cases so you can take it with you on business or pleasure trips away from home clean and maintain your equipment including your mask every day many units are equipped with computer chips that communicate the results of your sleep to your doctor follow your doctor s instructions regarding the recorded information from your unit some units require that the chip be taken to your doctor s office or downloaded via a computer the most common complaints of cpap users include simple side effects that can be managed nasal congestion and dry mouth are common side effects many units are now equipped with built in humidifiers that help with these problems wear the chin strap that comes with your unit to prevent dry mouth the chin strap functions to keep your mouth closed at night so you are breathing only through your nose depending on your response to cpap treatment your success with recommended lifestyle changes and the underlying cause of your apnea surgery may be an option to consider surgery is done to correct any problems related to anatomy and specific to the individual examples of surgical procedures sometimes used to treat sleep apnea include structural correction for nasal passage problems excessive amounts of tissue in the soft palate area or enlarged tonsils or adenoids that are blocking the passage of air when you sleep if surgery is determined to be an option the procedure done will be designed specifically to correct problems associated with that individual there is no general surgical procedure performed that is universally used to correct sleep apnea while anyone can have obstructive sleep apnea some conditions and characteristics make the condition more likely to develop the more common risk factors include the following being overweight as many as 50 of the people with obstructive sleep apnea are overweight fatty tissue deposits around the upper airway passages are thought to contribute to the problem having a larger waist size while this factor is unclear as to the direct relationship to obstructive sleep apnea other than being overweight it is considered a risk factor having a neck circumference greater than 17 inches in men and 16 inches in women is associated with developing obstructive sleep apnea being hypertensive or having high blood pressure having a narrowed airway in your throat this may be due to genetics or you may have enlarged tonsils or adenoids that are blocking the passage of air being diabetic people with diabetes are more likely to have obstructive sleep apnea being a man men are twice as likely as women to develop obstructive sleep apnea being black and under the age of 35 in this age group obstructive sleep apnea occurs more often in black people being between the ages of 18 and 60 while this disorder can occur in anyone at any age it is more common in people that are between the ages of 18 to 60 having a family history of obstructive sleep apnea places you at greater risk of developing the disorder being a smoker smoking puts you at higher risk of developing the disorder drinking alcohol alcohol use tends to cause the symptoms to worsen being a woman past menopause women who are past menopause have a higher risk of developing sleep apnea there are factors that increase your odds of developing central sleep apnea while anyone can develop central sleep apnea some factors clearly increase the risk some of the more common risk factors include the following males are more likely to develop this form of sleep apnea adults over the age of 65 develop central sleep apnea more frequently possibly due to other medical conditions or natural changes in sleep patterns cardiac problems including atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure are often linked to central sleep apnea brain tumors a history of stroke and conditions that involve the brainstem are associated with an increased risk of developing central sleep apnea sleeping at high altitudes may contribute to central sleep apnea this tends to resolve once you relocate to lower altitudes both obstructive and central sleep apnea can lead to complications with the possibility that some complications may develop even if you are treated it is not uncommon for some people to suffer from both forms of sleep apnea or have one type develop after the first has been identified the sudden changes in oxygen flow to the brain and other vital organs place a strain on the cardiovascular system consequently people may develop problems with high blood pressure which increases the risk of heart disease severe symptoms can lead to more serious consequences including coronary artery disease heart attack heart failure cardiac arrhythmias and stroke in people that already have a heart condition repeated episodes of low blood oxygen can cause a sudden cardiac event and possibly death daytime fatigue can be overwhelming and can cause problems with functioning due to the frequent awakenings your body is unable to establish the level of sleep needed called restorative sleep in order to be alert and well rested during the day people with obstructive or central sleep apnea are more likely to have problems with daytime concentration memory problems and mood changes some research has found a greater incidence of glaucoma in people that have obstructive sleep apnea another but very important matter is the disrupted sleep of your bed partner be sure your doctor or surgeon is aware of your condition in case you need a surgical procedure the use of anesthesia can sometimes worsen symptoms for a short time following the procedure let your doctor know of your problems depending on your situation some medications may need to be avoided that can cause further problems due to your sleep apnea 
query	73	prevent asthma asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the the lungs and airways that causes difficulty breathing as the airways narrow roughly 7 000 000 children are affected by asthma in the united states and it is the most common chronic respiratory disease among children of school age 1 asthma can be caused by many different environmental irritants known as triggers however the severity of asthma and its triggers vary widely from individual to individual though asthma itself cannot be prevented you can control certain factors to help reduce the severity and occurrence of symptoms and asthma attacks 2 determining your triggers avoiding your triggers living healthily with asthma identify your triggers keep an asthma diary monitor your breathing consult a doctor stay away from dust and mold avoid fragrances and other scents watch out for air pollution avoid all smoke fend off colds and flu treat your allergies have an asthma action plan in place manage your asthma monitor the severity of your asthma symptoms reduce your stress quit smoking or don t start maintain a healthy weight exercise many people with asthma can breathe run and exercise without trouble most of the time but certain triggers inside or outside your body can set off a cascade of symptoms that last from minutes to weeks when your asthma kicks in think about what environments you were recently exposed to and try to figure out what is setting you off this will help you know what to avoid in the future the most common triggers include air pollution smog and extreme changes in the weather can irritate and greatly increase the number of asthma attacks exposure to an allergen common allergens include grass trees pollen certain foods etc note that the combination of an allergic reaction along with an asthma attack can be very dangerous and should not be taken lightly cold air cold air can dry out airways and irritate the respiratory system causing an onset of asthmaillness a respiratory infection such as the common cold can dry out the airways and irritate the respiratory system causing the onset of your asthma irritants in the air any smoke from tobacco to wood smoke can trigger an asthma attack as can fragrances in the air like perfumes colognes and scented aerosols dust and mold your home environment can be the source of an asthma attack particularly if mold or dust are present stress and strong emotions if you are overwhelmed by stress or dealing with depression or anxiety then you may be more susceptible to an asthma attack physical activity exercise can trigger an asthma attack in some people foods that contain sulfites or other preservatives some people also have asthma attacks after consuming foods that contain sulfites or other preservatives such as shrimp beer wine and dried fruit if you are having trouble figuring out what causes your asthma to flare up keep track of your symptoms for several weeks in an asthma diary that details all the environmental physical and emotional factors you encountered grab your diary any time you experience a flareup and document your symptoms how you felt and what you did or were exposed to right before the attack look for a pattern if you suspect your asthma is triggered by bodily factors like the flu track your asthma and other illnesses over the course of a year and see if you can find a correlation be consistent the diary will be most useful if you fill it in as often as possible if you tend to be absent minded set an appointment on your phone or computer to remind you to update it if something eventful has happened bring your diary with you to checkups with your doctor as this can help your doctor craft a proper treatment regimen for you you should learn to recognize warning signs of an impending attack such as coughing wheezing shortness of breath or chest tightness it s also a good idea to regularly measure and record your peak airflow with a home peak flow meter since you may not be able to immediately register that your lung function is decreasing a peak expiratory flow meter is a small device that measures the maximum speed of expiration in order to monitor a person s ability to exhale air if the measurements range from 50 to 79 of your personal best this is indicative of an asthma flareup regularly measuring and logging your peak flow can help you determine what is normal and thus what is abnormal for you if your triggers still aren t clear your pulmonologist allergist or general practitioner can perform tests to help you discover what sets off your asthma allergy testing is not a tool used for general diagnosis of asthma but it is a useful technique for determining triggers a number of allergic symptoms can be associated with asthma the association of asthma with atopy is well documented atopy is defined as having ige antibodies to particular antigens which means you would have a genetic predisposition towards certain diseases including asthma rhinitis and eczema these are common asthma triggers and keeping a clean environment can go a long way in preventing asthma flareups make vacuuming and dusting part of your weekly cleaning routine to avoid triggering an asthma attack to avoid dust mites use mattress and pillow covers wash bedding often and avoid quilts that use down feathers mold is caused by humidity so use a hygrometer to check how humid your home environment is use a dehumidifier to keep the environment moisture and mold free regularly disinfect showers and other places where moisture can lead to mold growth if you suspect there is a significant mold problem in your home or work place get it professionally inspected and removed get a hepa or other type of air filter for your home you can also use fans and air conditioning to maintain good air circulation some people with asthma are highly sensitive to perfumes if that s you don t wear a lot of perfume and try to avoid being around people who wear a lot of perfume if you must use perfume use it lightly and try not to inhale it avoid using scented candles and air fresheners as well as scented products can irritate your nasal passages and breathing airways you can even opt for scent free laundry detergent studies have shown that cities with high levels of air pollution have much higher asthma rates especially among children smog car exhaust and other air pollutants can all contribute to asthma monitor your local air quality index and avoid exercising or spending too much time outside on bad days learn when air quality is best such as mornings in the summer and schedule outdoor activities for those times filter the air in your home through your air conditioner instead of opening windows avoid living by the highway or a busy intersection if you can move to a home that has fresh dry air whether from tobacco incense fireworks or anything else do your best to avoid inhaling smoke not only should you not smoke at all but you should make an effort to avoid being in the presence of other smokers or anything that elicits smoke and can cause your asthma to flare up research suggests a clear link between secondhand smoke and asthma especially in young people nearly 26 000 new diagnoses of asthma in children and teens may be due to secondhand smoke when your body is focused on dealing with an illness it has fewer resources to handle other types of diseases thus the combination of a cold flu with an asthma attack can be very dangerous when your asthma is triggered by other viruses minor sniffles can turn into weeks of wheezing and coughing take extra precautions to avoid getting sick get a seasonal influenza and pneumonia vaccination the flu isn t fun for anyone but people with asthma especially should be sure to get a flu shot every year consult your primary care physician for more information flu vaccines are typically offered from september until mid november each year avoid close contact with people who may be contagious don t share any food or drink with people who have a cold or the flu this increases your likelihood of getting sick wash your hands often especially during cold and flu season being mindful of germs and maintaining good hygiene can keep you from getting sick if you have allergies that hit your lungs or sinuses getting them treated can go a long way towards getting your asthma under control as well talk to your doctor or allergist about medications and strategies to treat your allergies decongestants and antihistamines can be purchased over the counter treat some allergy symptoms prescription nasal sprays and tablet medications can treat a variety of seasonal allergies immune therapy shots can reduce your allergies over the long term by helping your immune system build a tolerance to offending allergens if you re uncertain about whether you have allergies in the first place talk to your doctor about a possible allergy test this test will determine whether you demonstrate reactions to the most common allergic triggers which can also be unknown triggers for asthma once you are diagnosed with asthma create an asthma action plan with your allergist or physician this plan is basically a step by step process of what to do when you face an acute attack the plan should be written down and include emergency phone numbers as well as those of family and friends who can meet you at the hospital if needed having this plan and being in control of your own treatment can make you feel more in control over the illness you control your asthma it doesn t control you if you do have asthma there are a number of prescription drugs that can help you manage your asthma so that attacks become less frequent there are inhalers for both daily and quick relief use talk to your doctor about finding a medication that works for you there are two different type of rescue medications that you may have been prescribed a metered dose inhaler mdi or a dry powder inhaler dpi mdis the are most common inhalers they deliver asthma medication through a small aerosol canister equipped with a chemical propellant that pushes the medication into the lungs a dpi inhaler means of delivering dry powder asthma rescue medication without propellant a dpi requires you to breathe in quickly and deeply which makes them difficult to use during an asthma attack this makes them less popular than the standard mdis your doctor may also prescribe you a quick relief inhaler like albuterol which you are to use during emergencies and flareups watch yourself carefully for increasing use of this type of medication if you find yourself using it more and more often it means that your asthma is not under control seek medical advice from your doctor take your medication as prescribed just because your asthma seems to be improving doesn t mean that you should stop the medication consult your physician before making any changes asthma treatment is broken down into intermittent mild persistent moderate persistent and severe persistent disease the main diagnostic feature between these four categories include nocturnal awakenings the more severe and frequent the nocturnal awakenings are the more severe the asthma is categorized intermittent asthma usually occurs during the day with one or two episodes per week you experience two or less nocturnal awakenings per month mild persistent asthma presents with symptoms more than twice a week you may have three to four nocturnal awakenings per month moderate persistent asthma means you have daily symptoms with nocturnal awakenings more than once per week severe persistent asthma means you experience symptoms daily and nocturnal awakenings each night treatment for intermittent asthma includes a short acting

pain your doctor is trained to know which medication is likely to work best for the pain you re experiencing your doctor will also know what interactions must be avoided or otherwise handled many drugs can interfere with existing health issues they can also cause severe interactions and complications if used with other medications always consult with your healthcare professional before taking any medication for pain be aware that most drugs treat acute pain chronic pain is far more complex and to date there are no known drugs that cure chronic pain over the counter products are divided into two basic groups paracetamol acetaminophen based products and nsaids non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs while many of these are safe for temporary aches and pains you should only use them in accordance with the label directions consult with your doctor for long term medication plans talk to the pharmacist and or your doctor about using over the counter medications especially if you are already taking medications or you have a pre existing condition even otc pain relievers can cause severe complications for people with health issues such as heart disease high blood pressure kidney or liver disease or internal bleeding in the us paracetamol is known as acetaminophen paracetamol acetaminophen can be used to relieve fever headaches and other body aches and pains it does not reduce inflammation it has fewer side effects than other pain medications and is usually safe for children nsaids include aspirin ibuprofen and naproxen these can be used to relieve fever and pain they also relieve inflammation and swelling from mild injuries they are usually not recommended to be taken for more than 10 days when taken for a long time to manage chronic pain many nsaids can increase your risk of heart attack and stroke in some countries the mild opiate codeine is legal for purchase over the counter in many countries including the us medicines containing codeine are generally available only by prescription be careful not to overdose for example an overdose of acetaminophen can cause damage to your liver and even death since so many medications from headache pills to cough syrup contain acetaminophen it can be easy to take too much read the labels on otc medications carefully do not take several types of pain medications together they may have negative interactions and could cause damage topical pain relievers such as lotions creams and sprays are also available these may help relieve pain from arthritis or muscle pain you may want to look into nutritional supplements such as glucosamine which can ease joint pain in those suffering from arthritis if otc medications do not adequately manage your pain you can speak with your doctor about prescription painkillers it is important to consult with your doctor so that s he can prescribe a medication that takes into account any pre existing conditions your level of health the type of pain involved and other factors do not attempt to use prescription painkillers unless they have been prescribed specifically for you by your doctor common prescriptions for pain may include muscle relaxants prescription strength nsaids or opiate painkillers e g codeine percocet vicodin injections are a possibility for pain relief such as a local anesthetic a steroid injection anti inflammatory or a phenol injection a nerve block destroyer your doctor can help you decide whether this treatment is appropriate for you antidepressants are common and effective treatment for chronic pain even when depression is not present antidepressants may be used to treat pain from arthritis diabetes shingles nerve pain migraine back pain and more if you have persistent muscle pain trigger point injection may be helpful in this treatment a healthcare provider uses a small needle to inject a substance into a trigger point a knot of muscle that will not relax sometimes this substance is an anesthetic and or steroid other times it is a saline solution this type of treatment can be used to treat fibromyalgia and other chronic muscle pains it is usually used when other treatments have not worked this procedure must be done by a trained healthcare provider never attempt it yourself it is important to take any medication prescribed to you for pain relief this sounds straightforward but in reality many people either forget or forgo their medication for various reasons sometimes people may believe that the medicine is no longer helping other times people will stop taking a medication when they feel better even if the prescribed course is not complete not taking a medication as prescribed can cause complications and even other health issues for example say that you hurt the left side of your back without medication to take the pain away you will unconsciously favor that side in turn other muscles will compensate for this favoritism and even when your back is healed muscle memory will continue to overuse the right side an imbalance in your core muscle strength can in turn leave you with back problems leaving you back at square one and perhaps even worse than before not all complementary or integrative treatments are effective there are many treatments that make huge claims that aren t substantiated by scientific research before undergoing any complementary alternative or natural treatment for pain do your research and consult with your doctor the national center for complementary and integrative health which is a division of the national institutes of health has a free downloadable ebook about what to consider when thinking about complementary approaches to pain management consult with the licensing or certifying board of the practice you re considering for example make sure that your practitioner is licensed and or certified and that they have adequate training in their field natural does not necessarily mean safe always consult with your healthcare provider before undergoing any complementary treatment in many cases your doctor can help you can combine traditional medicine with complementary approaches for a better effect be suspicious of any treatment that claims to be a miracle cure or to treat many conditions at once these claims are almost always fraudulent acupuncture is not a magic bullet but several studies have shown that professional acupuncture can be effective in relieving pain especially lower back pain acupuncture uses very thin needles to stimulate sensitive points on your body it has long been a part of traditional chinese medicine and is now considered a viable pain relief technique by many medical doctors and researchers it s important to ask your doctor about alternative treatments including acupuncture all of your healthcare providers should work together in managing your pain not everyone responds to acupuncture its effects are usually visible within a few weeks if your pain does not improve after a few weeks of acupuncture treatment it may not work for you acupuncture has been shown by several studies to relieve back pain however it is often more effective when combined with other treatments such as pain medication the national certification commission for acupuncture and oriental medicine is the certifying board for acupuncturists in the united states they have a database of providers that may be helpful in searching for a reputable professional tens or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and dorsal column stimulation may help relieve pain these methods use a little machine that delivers small electrical impulses stimulating the nerves that carry touch sensations each approach has success with different kinds of pain but not all types for example the dorsal column stimulation seems to work best with nerve damage in legs but does little for back pain neither machine is a cure but they may be effective for some people some of the time to alleviate pain several studies have shown that regular massage by a trained massage therapist can reduce pain and disability massage can provide fairly quick pain relief especially for back and shoulder pain talk with your doctor about getting a referral for medical massage if you have a specific pain such as chronic neck pain your doctor may be able to give you a referral for targeted massage some health insurance companies will cover this type of massage but not other types however all massage by trained massage therapists has been shown to help relieve pain massage may also help reduce your reliance on pain medication these methods can be very helpful for pain especially related to muscle bone or joint pain they can also be helpful for neck or back pain an occupational therapist can work with you to learn to redirect pain so that it interferes less with your daily life taking your experience into account the occupational therapist may use visualization yoga meditation and gentle exercises to increase your stamina strength and ability to cope with pain physical therapy can help you manage pain by teaching strengthening and flexibility exercises manual therapy posture awareness and body mechanics instruction as well as assisting in discovering the root of your pain chiropractors are trained specialists who can manipulate your spinal area to improve your body s functioning and alignment it is a common treatment for lower back pain neck pain and frequent headaches this process is sometimes known as spine manipulation it has been shown to be effective for mild to moderate pain always have this procedure done by a licensed trained provider it is not a good option if you have nerve pain or damage consult with your doctor before visiting a chiropractor to make sure it is safe for you managing chronic pain with medication can cause your body to become tolerant of those medications tolerance requires you to take an ever increasing dose to experience any relief from the medication for individuals who suffer from chronic pain cognitive behavioral therapy cbt can be a useful complementary treatment performed with a trained therapist or psychologist cbt focuses on how you respond to experiences cbt teaches you to identify negative and unhelpful ways of responding to pain and replace them with helpful responses for example many studies have shown that ruminating on pain thinking the same thoughts over and over like a broken record e g i m in so much pain i can t stand it can make you experience pain more severely cbt will help you challenge those negative thoughts unlike medication you will not develop a tolerance for therapy and there are minimal side effects cbt has been demonstrated effective in managing many types of chronic pain including chronic lower back pain headaches arthritis and fibromyalgia cbt has also been used to treat pain from cancer cbt can be a good choice in treating chronic and recurring pain in children and adolescents biofeedback training relaxation training and

issues that require medical intervention you can find a directory of clinical biofeedback practitioners via the association for applied psychophysiology and biofeedback some jurisdictions have legalized the use of marijuana for medical purposes or even in general marijuana can help alleviate some types of pain especially general chronic pain it is important to consult with your doctor before using marijuana so that you understand its benefits and risks and make sure you know the legal status in your state some people should not use marijuana as it can interfere with pre existing health conditions medical marijuana has been shown to be effective for treating some nerve pain such as that caused by hiv or ms marijuana is natural but it also has risks it may irritate asthma or allergies it may also cause dizziness increased risk of bleeding or low blood pressure marijuana may be addictive women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not use marijuana teens who suffer from chronic pain should not use marijuana as it may cause psychosis impaired reactions and poor concentration you ll need a trained therapist for this approach and you need to be amenable to being hypnotized hypnosis for pain relief works by implanting suggestions that can take your mind off the pain however it tends to be short lived so it may not be the best long term solution it also tends

stress reduction mbsr because emotional and physical pain are strongly linked making yourself comfortable and using soothing techniques may help relieve your pain many studies have shown that a placebo is often as effective as medical treatment this may be because of your expectations if you expect a treatment to work it may be more likely to this is why things like chicken soup can actually help you feel better think of the things that caused you to feel better when you were sick as a child there may be certain foods and drinks that you link with comfort love and the easing of pain for some types of pain feeling too hot or too cold can exacerbate the feelings of pain keeping warm by adding a blanket a sweater a hot water bottle or taking a hot bath might help in some cases or if you re feeling too hot having a cool shower going for a swim sitting by a fan putting a wet cloth on your forehead etc might be ways to alleviate the pain a heating pad can be useful for the neck back and other strain type pains an ice pack is useful for sprains scratches bruises and cuts find a room or area that is away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and simply sit or lie down for a while on your own relaxing is a way to reduce your stress which can aggravate pain the american chronic pain association has a short five minute relaxation exercise that can help you control pain you can find it here theacpa org relaxation guide if clothing is constricting or pressing on a painful area of your body you won t feel relaxed and the pressure being applied can intensify the pain find clothes that do not constrict the area of pain even if this means wearing a larger size for a time if you don t have comfortable clothing you can get some from second hand stores thrift stores etc you don t need to spend a lot for comfort there are various ways in which breathing can both control the pain and help keep you relaxed controlled breathing the kind practiced by yogis and athletes can assist with pain relief this helps you to relax and focus often making the pain easier to handle some examples of this include inhale from the stomach slowly filling yourself with air up to the collarbones then exhale from the stomach repeating the same process in reverse make sure your exhalations are longer than your inhalations try to inhale to the count of four and exhale to six or if you can eight as you continue breathing try to make your inhalations and exhalations longer try inhaling for four seconds then exhale for six then hold with empty lungs and repeat this procedure this should help you to calm yourself and also distract you a little from the pain distraction is all about doing something else to take your mind off the pain it is often recommended by medical professionals to help control pain different things work for different people so you may need to try a range of things until you find something that helps you tolerate ongoing pain acute pain that feels unbearable requires fast distraction methods distraction won t remove the pain but it might provide you with the strength needed to handle it until its severity subsides creating minor pain and irritation can help to divert your mind s attention to major pain some quick distraction techniques include stroking rubbing or vibrating the skin above or around the painful area massaging the painful area clutching an ice cube in your hand or holding to a part of your body to provide an alternative shock of pain to distract from the real pain clapping your hands together tightly to change the focus to your hands clap harder to create minor temporary pain in the hand area to distract from the real pain gripping onto something such as a pole a stuffed toy a chair back etc swearing or cursing can help reduce pain research has shown that active distractions ones that require you to do something are more effective than passive distractions e g tv in controlling pain if your pain is acting up try playing a game doing a puzzle or doing some other activity that gets you involved this is useful for distracting and clearing the mind imagery works especially well when combined with pain medications try imagining the pain to be smaller for example if it s a headache then decide if the left or right side hurts worse does the front of that side or the back of that side hurt worse the upper of that side or the lower and so forth this can help to minimize the pain by making it seem smaller try picturing a beautiful relaxing place in your mind then imagine that the pain is an object that you can remove from that place for example your pain might be a rock that you throw far out into the ocean music can relieve stress and anxiety stress and anxiety often make our experience of physical pain worse listening to calm relaxing music can help you control emotional and physical pain classical music and other music that has approximately 70 beats per minute is best for relaxing you and relieving pain you should avoid listening to music that is too fast or driving as it could actually make you feel more pain relax in your favorite chair or resting spot ensure that you are as comfortable as you can be taking the type of pain you re suffering into account and then listen to the music for a good half hour or so find people who care about you and spend time in their company sometimes pain is amplified by feeling lonely and left out studies have shown that emotional and physical pain use the same brain pathways if you have good friends or supportive family members around whom you feel good and energized this can be a great way to distract yourself from the pain and to restore your sense of being connected and cared for the way you sit and the length of time you sit for can be a major source of pain if you have neck head shoulder torso upper and or lower back leg or arm pain and you sit a great deal consider whether that pain is either caused by or exacerbated by the sitting and lack of regular movement ensure that the ergonomics of your desk and chair have been professionally assessed and adjusted for your height and work style also make sure that your computer is at the right level for your height take regular breaks when working on computers machinery reading and other tasks that have you seated and locked into a single position for long periods of time the human body wasn t made for inactivity and getting up and moving about regularly can give your body the break it needs if you perform any sort of repetitive activity find ways to vary how you sit stand or move if you don t pain will be fairly inevitable result and in some cases may prove to be permanent some people find it helps to use a standing or a treadmill desk to ensure that they stay active while working with a computer or digital device if you are overweight the extra pounds increase the load you put on your joints and can lead to osteoarthritis pain as well as inflammation making changes to your diet and engaging in even light exercise like walking in a pool or lifting two pound weights helps reduce the strain on your body and can significantly reduce your pain though it may seem counterintuitive to exercise when your body is in pain it can lead to serious pain reduction in the long term start with small easy exercises and slowly build up your strength talk to you doctor about getting started and which kinds of exercise would be appropriate for you evaluate your diet and make sure you re eating a balanced healthy range of nutrient rich foods talk to your doctor or a nutritionist about getting on the right track what stresses you it is important to ask yourself that question and identify sources of stress in your life once you are clear on the triggers you can start to find ways to either reduce or avoid these which in turn will help to remove sources of pain aggravation stressors that can amplify pain include unhealthy eating smoking lack of sleep lack of exercise inappropriate environment procrastination and being around toxic people eat foods that give you the best nutritional returns while chocolate pastries fries and the like are tempting when you feel bad they provide little to no nutritional value and lessen the ability of your body to heal itself stick to foods that are nutritionally dense you might even like to spend some time researching on foods that are thought to heal the body get adequate rest being tired on top of feeling pain will always exacerbate the pain your body needs regular adequate sleep rest to run its standard restoration processes admittedly it can be a vicious cycle pain prevents sleep sleep lessens pain increases if this is happening to you get advice from your doctor get sufficient exercise exercise including a good long and steady walk around your neighborhood is an ideal way for relieving stress and ridding yourself of the pent up anxiety that can hamper sleep check your work or home environment an environment can come with its own stressors depending on your sensitivity for example a lot of noise a lack of privacy and crowded space can be sources of stress if you are constantly facing them and find them hard to deal with consider how you can reduce your exposure to such forms of stress such as wearing headphones shifting to a quieter space or getting outside often try to avoid procrastinating by getting your tasks chores work etc done on time you remove a source of stress find ways to work around or remove other sources of stress in your life that amplify the pain hate peak hour traffic rearrange your travel time to be outside of peak hours does networking cause you break out into a sweat and induce a migraine pinpoint one person worth talking to talk to that person then allow yourself to go for a walk outside until the next part of the event do family gatherings drive you to the point of despair smile a lot and simply say no thank you or pleased to know that instead of engaging in arguments and one upmanship save yourself the emotional exacerbation that can heighten pain if you have hurt yourself during sport physical activity or other actions it is important to rest the area that is injured so that it has a chance to heal for example if you hurt a leg keeping off that leg until it is stronger may be important for healing however don t become completely inactive as movement is usually a key part of recovery discuss finding the perfect balance with your doctor remember that pain is a warning if it hurts too much to use the harmed area during recovery do not push it the pain indicates that healing is still in process if you need to push past the pain signals for that part of your body to rebuild strength only do this under the supervision of a qualified health professional such as a physical therapist for those with muscle strains or sprains the best remedy is generally the rice model rest ice compression and elevation if you ve taken a fall on hard ground or your back is stiff however exercise can often be more beneficial than resting mild low impact exercise can relieve some types of chronic pain exercise that relieves anxiety will often relieve pain as well since anxiety can increase your perception of pain in some cases gentle stretching can help to alleviate the pain such as back pain it is a good idea to see a physiotherapist or similar professional who can advise you which exercises will benefit the area and relieve the pain be aware that doing the wrong exercises exercising in the wrong way or stretching too much can make the pain worse it could also lead to re injury if you aren t sure that the stretches are good ones to do don t do them until you have proper advice yoga and pilates are often a gentle way to stretch and relieve pain always use qualified instructors and be sure that your doctor or physical therapist has agreed to the exercise first several studies have shown that tai chi and yoga can help relieve pain some of this may be due to increased strength and flexibility developed by these exercises the emphasis on mindfulness and meditation in these practices may also help you manage pain tai chi is a gentle chinese martial art that incorporates meditation and fluid movements many gyms and community centers offer tai chi classes if you are pregnant have joint problems fractures or hernias consult your doctor before starting tai chi or yoga it is a process a journey it is likely that some moments times or days the pain will overwhelm you while other days you will feel more in control understanding that the struggle is likely to be ongoing can help you to be more accepting of the pain overall allowing you to start learning to live with it patience can be hard at times yet pain often teaches people patience especially for those who are used to doing everything and doing it quickly pain slows people down there is a need to take things more slowly during healing and recovery unfortunately this is often at odds with the fast paced world in which we live which can amplify pain if you pretend that you can cope when you can t realize that busyness will never go away allow yourself the time to recuperate and renew your strength going back to activities before you heal usually results in greater damage not a medal writing down your feelings and emotions can be both cathartic and revealing you don t have to share any of what you write with anyone so you can write down whatever you need to express reading back over the journal can reveal patterns of times when the pain is worse than other times allowing you to pinpoint actions or omissions that will help you to reduce the pain use your writing to explore your thinking how many negative thoughts are you experiencing is your thinking often negative or do you experience peaks and troughs of such thoughts while it is important to let your negative thoughts surface so that they can be experienced it is equally important to let go of them once you ve acknowledged their presence writing them down can help you to work through them then release them and this can help to alleviate pain too as you stop feeling so confused or bogged in negativity it is frequent to hear people dismiss pain in an attempt to act tough not be a wimp or tough it out pain is a very personal experience and there is no way that one person can assume that another s person pain isn t real severe or debilitating while each person suffering pain can seek and make use of methods that might relieve the pain the reality is that some pain cannot be easily treated and some pain no matter what is done does not go away do not judge yourself or allow others to judge you read all you can about your type of pain learn what others have to say about it and have done about it borrow the techniques and solutions that you think will work for you and see what happens of course keep it safe and sensible some people may dismiss pain as being all in your head as researchers learn more about the relationship between your mind and your body there is increasing evidence that shows that pain being all in your head doesn t mean it isn t also real realize that depression and anxiety are bed mates of those suffering chronic pain they need treating too so be sure to seek help asking for help from a therapist is a sign of strength and courage not of weakness you may find that if you can deal with these conditions the pain experience will lessen somewhat as your perception changes finding hope in your life is vital to pain recovery targeting pain relief as best you can requires a basic understanding of what pain is and how it is felt within your body and mind in a nutshell pain signals that there is danger distress or damage triggering a need to protect the area harmed pain is also a way of letting a damaged area heal sending out pain signals during the repair process allows your body to alert you that you need to take extra care of that part of your body physical pain is signaled through nociceptors pain receptors throughout your body the signals can be activated by cutting tearing inflammation irritation heat or other painful stimuli these pain receptors send signals via the myelinated sheathed nerves to the an area of the spinal cord called the dorsal horn the dorsal horn decides whether to dampen or amplify these signals before sending them to the brain nociceptors pain receptors are found in most of the body s tissues and there are more of them in sensitive zones pain is felt in the brain this is why referred pain is possible when one part of the body experiences the pain even though another part of the body is injured the brain s role also helps explain why we may experience pain even after our injuries have healed the brain may continue to send protective pain signals without a clear cause pain signals from the head and face area go directly to the brain stem pain signals from these areas may go to the thalamus a relay station that sends a variety of sense signals to different areas of your brain pain comes in two forms acute and chronic acute pain is immediate pain from an injury disease or damage for example if you break your ankle the pain from that injury is acute pain it has a clear and immediate cause and should dissipate as the injury heals chronic pain is ongoing and often embedded in a long lasting injury or damage pain is considered to have become chronic when it has continued more than three to six months after the damage or persists beyond the standard healing time expected for the injury in question chronic pain is often considered by medical professionals as a disease in itself much like diabetes or asthma chronic pain often involves psychological aspects as well as physiological aspects emotional responses such as anxiety anger and fear can exacerbate chronic pain treating it can be complex and difficult three common types of chronic pain are low back pain headache or migraine and neck pain fibromyalgia is a common diagnosis for sufferers of some chronic pain and or fatigue scientists do not yet know what causes fibromyalgia possible culprits include physical or emotional trauma differing brain responses to pain sleep disturbances or infection fibromyalgia most commonly affects women between the ages of 20 and 50 there are several theories about how your body processes pain responses one widely influential theory of pain is the gate control theory first proposed in the 1960s this theory suggests that pain is like an open gate that can be closed by non painful input essentially your brain becomes confused because it is getting two messages at once pain danger and touch or vibration not a threat this confusion may keep your brain from processing as much of the pain response for example if you hit your thumb with a hammer your first response may be to suck on it or shake it the gate control theory explains this response because the non painful response may suppress the pain sensation that is coming from your central nervous system the periaqueductal grey pag area of your brain is also involved in regulating pain this area operates through a process known as stimulation produced analgesia or spa stimulation of the pag inhibits neurons in your spine causing them to modulate i e reduce your pain at the spinal cord before it travels back to your brain conflicting messages can stimulate or turn on cells in the pag when opiates called endorphins are released these stimulated cells which have receptors for those endorphins receive them and reduce your pain this process may help explain why acupuncture can be effective in pain management some drugs for example morphine bind to the same receptors as endorphins the body s natural pain killers hurt feelings are more than an expression they re scientific fact research has shown that emotional pain stimulates the same areas of your brain as physical pain do not feel ashamed of feeling emotional or physical pain because pain is such a personal subjective experience managing or coping with that pain is too don t let anyone dictate how you ought to cope with your pain for example one study showed that feeling excluded from a social activity activated the brain s anterior cingulate cortex in participants this area is also activated during physical pain another study showed that a breakup can actively hurt when participants were shown a photograph of an ex as they thought about the breakup the same areas in their brain and body the secondary somatosensory cortex and dorsal posterior insula activated that are responsible for physical pain how you feel and think about pain can have a huge impact on how you continue to feel the pain your thoughts about it can increase or decrease the pain blocking messages from your brain the more anxious negative or depressed you re feeling the greater the pain is likely to feel getting psychological help such as therapy can help you manage physical pain as well as emotional pain in order to manage pain effectively you have to know what is causing it while there is a lot of information available to you that information can also make you worry excessively or misdiagnose your pain consulting with your doctor will help you get a proper diagnosis and understand how to treat your pain there are several categories of pain that can help you narrow down what may be causing your pain neuropathic this kind of pain is caused by damage to the nervous system this type of pain often causes symptoms such as burning or tinglingnumbness with the painstabbing painradicular this pain is caused by compression or irritation of nerves in your neck and spine you may experience shooting pains that radiate down your arm or leg somatic this pain is what we often associate with pain it happens when pain receptors in your body either on its surface or in musculoskeletal tissues are stimulated myofascial myofascial pain is a subtype of somatic pain that refers specifically to muscles this pain can involve a single muscle or a muscle group visceral this pain is related to your guts viscera heart lungs bladder and other internal organs this type of pain can feel very vague or nonspecific you may not know where the pain is originating you just know that you hurt not all causes of pain can be identified it is important to keep talking to your doctor specialist and or psychologist about what to do when you continue to feel pain but no identifiable cause can be found or appropriate solution given be as tenacious as the pain is to try to unearth what is really behind the pain in most cases doctors will rely on your description of your pain to help them understand how to treat you in addition to examinations and tests your doctor will likely interview you about your pain this is called taking a pain history the more specific you can be the better your doctor will be able to help you manage your pain for example doctors may ask whether your pain is sharp or dull constant or intermittent burning or aching other things about your pain to consider include whether the pain is concentrated in one area or is spread all over when you feel the pain is most severe what activities or movements make the pain worse or better how the pain affects your activities and daily life there are many terms that can help you describe how your pain feels thinking about words to describe your pain may help you communicate how you re feeling to

pretty much all there would be so we should use it or lose it as the saying goes your brain consists of four primary lobes convoluted structures found within the lobes left and right hemispheres intricate communication networks and more than 100 billion neural cells the good news is in recent years the scientific research community has discovered a process called neuroplasticity this means that the neuronal communication pathways and neural cells in the brain continue to grow throughout all the years of our lives the process slows as we age but it doesn t stop completely as was once believed stimulating the growth of new neural cells and pathways to improve your thinking skills and your overall brain function can be done exercising your brain exercising your body to improve your thinking skills stimulating your frontal lobe expanding your critical thinking ability using diet and supplements to improve your brain function grow new neurons try something new perform neurobic exercises improve whole brain blood flow try strategy based brain training boost your brain by using mental exercises perform math calculations in your head create pictures of words in your head participate in making music take a class learn a new language learn a new sport talk to people develop friendships with a diverse group participate in aerobic exercise integrate exercise with your study habits exercise to increase your bdnf levels start exercising now the younger the better get up and move improve your cognitive flexibility think of your frontal lobe as your central command play use your imagination avoid negative influences give a hug listen to music review the results from a rock music study accept the challenge make use of wasted time solve a problem each day focus your thoughts each week on one intellectual standard journal reshape your character face your own egocentric thinking adjust the way you see things recognize your emotional reactions review groups that influence your life think about how you think eat a healthy diet monitor your cholesterol prevent medical conditions that cause cognitive decline know the facts about supplements see your doctor as soon as you notice symptoms your brain is filled with literally billions of cells that contain a cell nucleus axons dendrites and synapses one proven way to grow new neurons is to learn the existing axons dendrites and synapses need to be maintained so don t get lazy continue to perform the things you already do including sports reading puzzles exercise crafts or music the key to growing new neurons is to teach yourself something different maybe even something that feels awkward at first neuroplasticity of the brain or the ability to grow new brain cells happens if you take charge and expose your brain to something different learn to juggle dance play a musical instrument or anything that is new to you even doing familiar things in a different way can help for example navigate your way through your home safely while walking backwards try anything you can think of that creates a challenge for your brain but it must be something that requires you to think neurobics are exercises designed to stimulate new growth in the brain the primary basis of neurobics involves using the senses to stimulate new brain pathways think of ways to challenge your brain by altering your sensory perceptions some basic examples follow get dressed in the morning with your eyes shut or a blind fold on wear headphones that suppress sound while trying to verbally communicate with a friend include speaking and trying to understand what they are saying by mouth movements and hand gestures if you play the piano try playing a simple and familiar piece with your eyes shut or with two fingers taped together try playing a simple piece using all fingers but play the bass clef using your right hand and above middle c and the treble clef with your left hand and below middle c use your non dominant hand for routine activities try brushing your teeth combing your hair and using a computer mouse using your non dominant hand write with your non dominant hand try writing several sentences from memory perhaps the first verse of a familiar poem or song making the letters upside down as a mirror image or from right to left on the page try playing your favorite sport using your non dominant hand break your routines put your shoes on in the opposite order mow the yard in the opposite direction think of other frequent routines and alter their order go for an early morning walk simply to identify smells around you try to identify the ingredients in a meal just from taste and smell a recent study used only strategy based brain training without introducing any elements of physical exercise to improve blood flow in the brain the results showed that whole brain blood flow was significantly increased by using only brain training exercises the point of the study was to increase whole brain blood flow using only mental exercises when blood flow to the brain slows down atrophy of brain tissues results atrophy in the brain means that cells degenerate important communicate pathways degrade and the brain tissue and important structures shrink away the study enrolled people of all ages that had suffered a traumatic brain injury with about 65 of the enrollees having suffered the brain injury at least 10 years prior part of the group was exposed to strategy based brain training and the others were exposed to general teaching materials for the same amount of time about how the brain works the group that received the strategy based training improved abstract thinking scores by more than 20 memory function measures improved by 30 and the whole brain blood flow showed a significant increase as compared to the control group many of the group participants also suffered from symptoms of depression and post traumatic stress disorder depressive symptoms were improved in the strategy based training group by 60 and post traumatic stress disorder symptoms improved by almost 40 strategy based brain training really works to increase whole brain blood flow and can help to prevent brain shrinkage this form of brain training is common and can be found all around you including in your daily newspaper strategy brain games are any games that you have to think about to solve do a crossword puzzle a word scramble puzzle complete a sudoku puzzle or put together an actual table top puzzle puzzle games that are not left to chance that require you to think about them to solve them are considered strategy based brain games play with another person games like chess go or even checkers involve thinking about your moves and anticipating the moves of the person you are playing against make a list of something you commonly do like a grocery list or things to do that day and memorize the list a few hours after you have completed the list or even the next day try to remember everything on it start simple and systematically as you get more comfortable with the easier problems work your way into harder math make it even more interesting by taking a walk while you do the calculations in your head visualize a word then create a way to challenge yourself using that word one way is to think of other words that start and end with the same letters or think of words that have more syllables than the first one but still rhyme the musical experience is a valuable one do something musical that you are not accustomed to doing if you already play an instrument learn to play a different one join a singing group even if you cannot sing well joining a choir or vocal group will significantly expand your brain function on several levels you will learn to understand organization of the music on the pages you will be singing timing and rhythm and organized singing plus you will be exposed socially to a new group of people which provides a wonderful opportunity to expand your brain even further as you learn about music try a cooking class auto mechanics wood working sewing or crafting taking a class in something that you do not know how to do but are interested in learning helps to develop new pathways in your brain this happens both by learning the new material and interacting with new people in a new environment this is a very good way to improve cognitive function and thinking ability new languages also help to expand your vocabulary which is associated with higher cognitive functioning plus hearing and speaking a new language develops new pathways in your brain try a sport that is new to you and consider one that involves at least one other player golf is a sport that you can basically play alone but it is more challenging when you play with someone this creates additional experiences for your brain to organize and react to and therefore the growth of new brain cells and pathways result the more conversations you have the more your brain has to work in order to compensate and process the new information if you have children have conversations with them the more conversations you have with your child the smarter they will be having conversations on topics with people that have very different opinions challenges your brain and your executive function abilities to determine how you respond to the same topic but in different groups the more diverse your friends are the more your brain is challenged to become creative both in conversation and in participation of different types of social interactions more and more research points to physical exercise as the most effective way to improve thinking skills and overall brain function create an exercise routine that includes one hour sessions three times a week and basic exercises like walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike stay with your exercise routine for at least 12 weeks in order to improve your brain fitness cognitive abilities and thinking skills a recent study done in sedentary people aged 57 to 75 years of age supports this level of exercise with scientific data the exercise group showed rapid improvement in circulating blood flow to areas of the brain significant improvement in both immediate and delayed areas of memory function improved cognitive abilities frontal lobe functioning visuospatial skills processing speed and overall improved cognition cardiovascular measures included as part of the study design were also notably improved the authors interpret the study results as further indication that any person at any age can take steps through the use of physical exercise to positively influences brain neuroplasticity recall of vocabulary words was significantly improved when exercise was included just before during or immediately after exposure to the vocabulary words two different studies one in female college students and one in male college students validated much improved recall of vocabulary words studied when associated with exercise the female students did the best when they were exposed to their vocabulary words for 30 minutes while they were also exercising the form of exercise in this study was riding a stationary bicycle for 30 minutes the male students were divided into groups that included no exercise moderate exercise or vigorous exercise the improvement was noted in the students that were exposed to their vocabulary words either immediately prior or immediately after vigorous exercise cognitive function and memory recall is improved when a substance called brain derived neurotrophic factor or bdnf is elevated exercise increases you levels of bdnf your bdnf levels fall back to normal ranges approximately 30 minutes after stopping your exercise routine so take advantage of that time tackle a difficult project from work or study for an exam as soon as you can following your exercise routine structures within our brain perform different functions and communicate through complex networks to keep our thinking skills sharp and memory function stable help make critical decisions strategize ways to solve problems process and organize incoming information keep our emotions in check and control how we respond to countless situations when structures in the brain lose volume or start to shrink our brain function declines along with the parts of the brain that are shrinking exercise helps to prevent shrinkage the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus structures in the brain that support memory function and higher level cognitive functions begin to shrink at a rate of about 1 to 2 each year for people over the age of 55 years research done in 2010 showed the first documented evidence that exercising early in life helps to prevent shrinkage in the brain in later years reducing the risk of cognitive decline the scientific community is still working to determine the best exercises to do and how long to do them in order to provide the greatest improvement in brain function while that question remains unanswered some things have become clear stretching and muscle tone exercises do very little to nothing to improve brain function whatever you do it needs to be something that requires active participation walking on a treadmill and riding a stationary bicycle count as actively participating this type of aerobic exercise helps not only to maintain brain abilities but can actually help to recover abilities that may be fading away even when the aging process medical conditions and even brain injury are working against you exercising is your proven way to fight back so get up and move walk using a treadmill or a calculated and safe path ride a stationary bicycle or a regular one if safety permits and possibly even participate in competitive sports like tennis competitive and active sports such as tennis may provide even greater benefit since other areas of the brain are engaged the additional parts of brain exposure involve socializing problem solving visuospatial reaction anticipation and reaction times cognitive flexibility allows us to think about more than one thing at the same time to rapidly switch your activity and your thoughts from one topic to another and to quickly adapt to changing situations active and persistent exercise specifically running has been associated with significant improvements in cognitive flexibility your frontal lobe is the largest of the four lobes and is the area responsible for higher level cognitive function the frontal lobe is the center of your executive function and also integrates communication throughout the rest of your brain in order to carry out your executive function decisions executive function abilities are needed for organizing the information that is coming into the brain and to regulate how your respond examples include time management attention processes multi tasking and switching focus being detail oriented when needed controlling what you say and do and making decisions based on you own prior experiences both physical play as exercise and gentle play with a child friend or family member helps to strengthen the frontal cortex and the processes involved with executive function physical play helps to sharpen your executive function skills as you anticipate and react to constantly changing situations imaginative play helps to strengthen executive function ability as your brain works to strategize your reaction to the unknown circumstances and situations you are creating in your mind think of positive scenarios and develop them into stories or chapters within a story find images in the clouds imagine a conversation between ducks and fish create a painting in your head of your favorite song or do anything that engages your imagination using your imagination stimulates your brain to release chemicals that are rewarding and engaging firing brain neurons along axons dendrites and synapses that are seldom used is key in growing new ones while it is important to address situations that are difficult try to avoid allowing the negativity to persuade the way you think and feel some people and situations can be very dramatic keep a positive and problem solving attitude when faced with negative circumstances forms of physical contact such as giving and receiving hugs and other physical gestures of support and friendship provide a calming effect on the brain positive social interactions are healthy and can help to develop new pathways in your brain when you are in an unfamiliar yet positive situation social interaction is important to creating new brain pathways your brain is constantly learning and utilizing executive function skills as you interact with other people formulate your response to situations and consider possible reactions of the other person and react accordingly music has been clearly shown to cause changes both positive and negative in the frontal lobe of the brain exposure to music has been proven as an aid to improve your iq and enhance the ability to learn reading and literacy skills improve spatial temporal reasoning is enhanced and mathematical abilities are improved some styles of music has been tied to bad outcomes including unhealthy lifestyle choices criminal activity and even suicidal behavior other styles of music are linked to early development of visuospatial abilities better math performance improved ability to learn a foreign language and an overall healthy lifestyle the study used three groups of mice exposed to different music styles the group exposed to rock music including disharmonic beats behaved in a disorganized confused and lost manner that group forgot their way to food in a maze they had already located two other groups one exposed to only classical music and one to no music at all were able to find their way through the maze to the food actually performing even faster with further study the scientists found frontal lobe shrinkage and hippocampal damage in the group exposed to the rock music with disharmonic beats while several studies suggest that rock music or possibly the binaural beats within rock music has a negative influence other research supports music of choice including rock music as a good way to engage your brain and develop additional neuronal pathways improving your critical thinking skills is a commitment to yourself this is a process that takes time critical thinking is a method of analyzing evaluating and making decisions most people take thinking for granted and overlook the need to evaluate thinking habits and develop new and positive ways to critically evaluate and react to daily circumstances realize that it takes both time to evaluate change and develop critical thinking skills and practice to arrive at the level you want just as a professional athlete or musician continues to sharpen their talents and abilities you can work to sharpen your thinking skills improving your critical thinking ability requires approaching information and decision making by avoiding prejudice over generalization common fallacies or pre determined beliefs deception and rigidity and narrowness in your thinking doing things that are concrete helps to bring your thinking processes to light and helps you to make changes that improve your critical thinking any one step can be helpful but actively and routinely practicing changes over time improves your thinking ability avoid flipping through channels getting frustrated while sitting in traffic worrying unproductively and jumping from one activity or diversion to another without enjoying anything use that valuable time to ask yourself questions that can improve your approach to the next day ask questions that help you evaluate what you did well that day or not so well consider your strengths and weaknesses of the day so far if possible record your answers so you can develop your thoughts in those areas even further set aside problems that are out of your control and focus on the tools you need and the steps to take to solve problems within your control avoid becoming overwhelmed or emotional and work through the problem in an organized logical and thoughtful manner consider factors like short term solutions as opposed to long term solutions the advantages and disadvantages of the solutions you are considering and develop a workable strategy to solve the problem accepted intellectual standards include clarity of thought precision accuracy relevance depth breadth logical factors and significance for example during the week you focus on clarity you may want to think about how clearly you communicated something during a meeting or in a conversation with your spouse or a friend think about ways you might have improved on your clarity also consider how clear others have communicated information to you or to a group clarity in writing is just as important evaluate your own written communications those of others and in published literature follow a pattern to your journaling and make several entries each week write about situations in which you were involved how you responded your analysis of things apparent and hidden in the situation and an assessment of what you learned about yourself in the process focus on one intellectual trait each month including perseverance autonomy empathy courage humility and any other traits you may admire in others but find lacking in yourself think about each trait and develop a strategy to improve that trait in yourself possibly include your progress in your journal keep your focus on your selected trait throughout the month continually evaluate your performance noting improvement setbacks and additional work needed placing bias on yourself is a natural way of thinking ask yourself questions to help identify situations where you may have placed too much emphasis on your own opinion include questions that help you evaluate any actions you may have taken based on irritability over unimportant or small things saying or doing things irrationally to push things your way or situations where you imposed your own will or opinion on others once you recognize your egocentric reactions take steps to modify your thinking to correct those behaviors practice seeing the good in difficult or negative situations every situation has the potential to be positive or negative seeing the positive in a situation leads one to feel more rewarded less frustrated and overall happier take the opportunity to turn mistakes into opportunities and dead ends into beginnings evaluate situations or thoughts that cause you to feel angry sad frustrated or upset take the opportunity to explore what is causing your negative emotion and find a way to turn that into a positive reaction groups have a way of suggesting certain beliefs or behaviors that are better than others analyze the groups in your own life that influence your decisions and your actions consider pressures placed on you by the group and evaluate those pressures as being positive or negative consider how you can adjust your own reaction to negative pressures without damaging relationships or altering the group dynamic practice your thinking skills and develop your critical thinking ability develop and implement strategies that use your personal experiences in order to further influence and develop your critical thinking skills a recent article evaluated the diet in 550 seniors the study authors were only looking for evidence of a link between diet and brain function the researchers found more than what they were looking for the study revealed that eating a healthy diet actually improves executive functioning in the frontal lobe the results also strongly suggest that eating a healthy diet can shield the brain against aging processes that lead to dementia and alzheimer s disease study participants that had the best scores also were more interested in physical activity and in avoiding habits like smoking while cholesterol levels have not been directly tied to brain function people with lower cholesterol levels have stable blood flow which allows the oxygen in the blood to be effectively carried to the brain for optimal function talk to your doctor about your cholesterol levels there may be ways to effectively address any levels that are not within the normal range interventions recommended by your doctor can include both prescription medications as well as non medication options some study participants showed results as high as 66 reduction in the odds of developing poor executive function based solely on healthy levels of saturated fat intake which contributes to lower cholesterol levels beyond the brain function values researchers concluded that maintaining a healthy diet can prevent conditions that lead to slower thinking cognitive decline and lower executive functioning abilities some medical conditions known to contribute to an overall decline in brain function include cardiovascular disease diabetes vascular disease and obesity according to information provided by the national institute of health s center for complementary and integrative health many products are claiming benefits that do not exist scientific evaluations of supplements that claim benefit in improving brain function preventing memory loss improving memory function treating dementia or slowing alzheimer s disease reveal those claims to be unsubstantiated to date there is no evidence to support the claims of efficacy that any dietary or herbal supplement can prevent decline in functioning or improve problems in memory function this includes products such as ginkgo omega 3 fatty acids fish oil vitamins b and e asian ginseng grape seed extract and curcumin while there is no evidence to support any claims of efficacy of these products scientists are continuing to study some of these agents to determine if there is any possible benefit research involving mindfulness techniques and music therapy is ongoing with preliminary results showing some promise in these areas do not delay in seeing your doctor while you attempt to try other approaches while some approaches may be helpful to your condition your physician can provide a tremendous amount of information that may direct your care in a manner that has proven results many complementary approaches that include herbal medicines and some vitamin products can seriously interact with prescription strength medications talk to your doctor before you try any products to treat symptoms of decline in cognitive abilities or evidence of memory loss 
query	76	treat carpal tunnel syndrome carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by nerve compression is within the tunnel which is composed of the carpal bones but also the transverse carpal ligament this compression causes pain numbness tingling and or weakness in the wrist and hand 1 repetitive strains sprains unusual wrist anatomy old fractures and other health issues increase the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome the goal of treatment is to create more space for a main nerve into the hand so it doesn t get irritated or inflamed home treatments can be helpful but sometimes professional help including surgery is needed to relieve the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome dealing with carpal tunnel syndrome at home changing your habits getting treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome avoid irritating your median nerves stretch your wrists take over the counter otc anti inflammatories use cold therapy wear a wrist splint change your sleeping position alter your work station make an appointment with your doctor ask about corticosteroid injections consider surgery as a last resort be patient with recovery the carpal tunnel within your wrist is a narrow passageway made up of small carpal bones and ligaments the tunnel protects nerves blood vessels and tendons that go into your hand the main nerve that innervates your hand is called the median nerve avoid activities that compress and irritate the median nerve such as repetitively flexing your wrist lifting heavy weights with your hands sleeping with bent wrists and punching solid objects wearing tight bracelets and watches may be a risk factor also so make sure to leave ample space in many cases of carpal tunnel syndrome a single cause is difficult to identify often it involves a combination of factors such as arthritis or diabetes combined with repetitive strain in the wrist the wrist anatomy of people can make a difference some have naturally smaller passageways in their wrists or have carpal bones that are positioned oddly stretching your wrists on a regular basis can be effective at reducing or minimizing carpal tunnel symptoms in particular wrist extensions can help make more room for the median nerve in the carpal tunnel by stretching the ligaments that attach to the carpal bones the easiest way to extend and stretch both wrists at the same time is the prayer pose with your palms together put your palms together in front of your chest and raise your elbows until you feel a nice stretch in your wrists hold for 30 seconds and repeat 3 5x daily you can also grab the fingers of the affected hand and pull backwards until you feel a stretch at the front of your wrist you may feel more temporary tingling in your hand with this stretch but don t stop unless you feel pain in addition to hand tingling other symptoms commonly associated with carpal tunnel syndrome are numbness throbbing pain muscle weakness and color changes too pale or too red the only part of the wrist hand typically spared symptoms is the little finger it s not innervated by the median nerve the symptoms of carpal tunnel are often related to having inflammation swelling in the wrist which either directly irritates the median nerve or crowds pinches it as such taking otc non steroidal anti inflammatories nsaids such as ibuprofen motrin advil or naproxen aleve can be very helpful to reduce symptoms short term painkillers such as acetaminophen tylenol paracetamol can be used for carpal tunnel also but they don t impact swelling only the pain anti inflammatories and analgesics should be considered short term strategies for pain control there isn t any evidence that these drugs improve carpal tunnel syndrome in the long term taking too many nsaids or taking them for too long significantly increases your risk of stomach irritation ulcers and kidney failure taking too much acetaminophen or taking it for too can cause liver damage as an alternative rub an ointment that contains a natural pain reliever into your sore wrist hand menthol camphor arnica and capsaicin are all helpful for relieving mild to moderate pain if your wrist is sore and looks or feels swollen then apply a small bag of crushed ice or something cold to it in order to reduce inflammation and numb the pain doing so may also reduce hand symptoms cold therapy is most effective for soft tissue injuries that involve some sort of swelling because it reduces blood flow apply the crushed ice to your wrist for about 5 10 minutes 3 5x daily until the symptoms subside compressing the ice against your wrist with a stretchy tensor or ace bandage is even more effective for fighting inflammation always wrap ice in a thin cloth before applying it skin it prevents skin irritation or frostbite if crushed ice isn t available use a large ice cube frozen gel pack or small bag of frozen veggies instead in some cases cold therapy may aggravate the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome avoid ice if that s the case with you wearing a rigid brace or splint that holds your wrist in a neutral position during the day may reduce the compression or irritation of the median nerve and help with carpal tunnel symptoms splints or wrist braces can also be worn during activities that aggravate symptoms such as working at the computer bowling or carrying groceries wearing splints while you sleep can help relieve nighttime symptoms of tingling and numbness in your hands especially if you have a habit of curling your wrists you may need to wear a splint for several weeks day and night to get significant relief from carpal tunnel symptoms for some sufferers splints and braces provide negligible benefit splinting at night can be a good idea if you re pregnant and have carpal tunnel syndrome because pregnancy tends to increase swelling edema in the hands and feet wrist splints and braces can be purchased at most pharmacies and medical supply stores some sleeping postures can aggravate the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome sleeping with your fists clenched and wrists tucked in flexed is the worst position but having your arms extended above your head is not great either instead sleep on your back or side with your arms at your sides and try to keep your hands open and your wrists in a neutral position wearing a wrist splint or brace is very helpful in this regard although it takes a little getting used to don t sleep on your stomach with your hands wrists compressed under your pillow people who do this frequently wake up with numb and tingly hands most wrist splints and braces are made of nylon and fasten with velcro which can irritate other parts of your body consider covering your splint with a sock or thin cloth to reduce irritating other body parts your carpal tunnel problem may be caused or aggravated by a poorly designed work station if your computer keyboard mouse desk and or chair isn t positioned properly for your height and body proportions it can put strain on your wrists shoulders neck and mid back make sure your keyboard is low enough so that your wrists are not constantly bent upwards while typing consider getting an ergonomic keyboard and mouse designed to take the stress off your wrists and hands putting cushioned pads underneath your keyboard and mouse can lessen the impact on your hands and wrists have an occupational therapist review your body positions while performing your job people who work on computers for many hours each day are at higher risk of carpal tunnel syndrome if you are feeling any carpal tunnel symptoms in your wrist and hand that persist for more than a few weeks then see your doctor for an examination your doctor may take x rays and blood tests to rule out other causes of wrist hand pain such as rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis advanced diabetes hairline fractures or vascular problems electrodiagnostic studies emg and nerve conduction are usually done to confirm the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome your doctor will see if you can perform certain tasks that are difficult with carpal tunnel syndrome such as making a tight fist pinching your thumb and forefinger together and manipulating small objects with precision your doctor may ask about your profession as certain jobs are at high risk carpenters cashiers assembly line workers musicians auto mechanics and people who work on computers for long hours your doctor may recommend injecting the carpal tunnel area of your wrist with corticosteroid medication such as cortisone to relieve the pain inflammation and other symptoms corticosteroids are strong and fast acting anti inflammatories that can quickly decrease swelling in your wrist which relieves pressure on the median nerve taking oral corticosteroids by mouth is another option but these drugs are not considered as effective as injections and they come with significant side effects other common corticosteroid medications used for carpal tunnel syndrome are prednisolone dexamethasone and triamcinolone potential complications of corticosteroid injections include local infection bleeding tendon weakening local muscle atrophy and nerve irritation damage as such injections are limited to 2 per year if corticosteroid injections fail to significantly reduce the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome then surgery should be considered if all other remedies and treatments fail to give you relief then your doctor will likely recommend carpal tunnel surgery surgery should be considered as a last resort although it can completely relieve your symptoms for good with minimal risk so it should not be considered as a long shot the goal of surgery is to relieve pressure on the median nerve by cutting the ligament pressing on it however carpal tunnel surgery can be performed in two different ways endoscopic or open surgery endoscopic surgery involves uses a telescope like device with a tiny camera on the end endoscope which is inserted through a small incision in your wrist or hand the endoscope can see inside the carpal tunnel and cut the problematic ligament endoscopic surgery typically results in the least amount of pain and the quickest recovery open surgery involves making a larger incision in the palm of your hand and over your wrist in order to cut through the problematic ligament which frees the nerve surgery risks include nerve damage infection and scar tissue formation following the surgery it s done on an outpatient basis you ll be asked to often elevate your hand above your heart and move your fingers which reduces swelling and prevents stiffness mild pain swelling and stiffness in the palm and wrist can be expected post surgery for up to 6 months and complete recovery may take a year for the first 2 4 weeks you may be required to wear a splint or brace although using your hand is encouraged most people s symptoms get much better after surgery but recovery is often slow and gradual on average hand strength returns to normal 2 months after surgery carpal tunnel syndrome can occasionally recur about 10 of the time and may require additional surgery 
query	77	test dog dna and analyze parentage testing your dog s dna can help you keep track of your dog as well as figure out ancestry and parentage if you have a new dog it is a good idea to get a dna profile the dna profile will help determine identity in the event that your dog is lost if you have a mixed breed dog and have always wondered about its ancestry a dna test can help you figure this out and if you want to figure out who is the father or mother of your dog a dna paternity test will be useful ordering a dna test collecting the sample interpreting the results look for a reputable laboratory weigh the cost select a type of test order a dog dna profile collect a sample of your dog s dna for the ancestry test collect the dna samples for the parentage test ask your veterinarian to collect a sample of your dog s dna send the sample of your dog s dna to the laboratory review the results of the parentage analysis review your results of the ancestry analysis talk to the laboratory about the results start by asking your veterinarian about the most appropriate laboratory to obtain the test you want two of the bigger companies that offer dna testing are wisdom panel and dna my dog consider asking your veterinarian which laboratories are the most reputable and whether there are significant differences in price ask them what is the best laboratory to test my dog s dna how many laboratories offer these tests in our region what are the cost differences between the competing laboratories are there any major differences in customer service between the laboratories dna tests can vary in cost depending on what you re testing for and where you re having the test done if you are shopping around consider both the price of the actual dna test and any additional costs involved in transporting the dna sample and following up with a veterinarian at the lab if the price difference between laboratories is small you should also consider whether or not it is worth spending a little more and whether there are any associated differences in expertise or service if you are a dog owner or a breeder you may want to determine the parentage of your dog and you may also want to figure out the ancestry of your dog ask your veterinarian to order the particular type of test that you d like alternately visit a laboratory in person or online to order the test directly from a laboratory that specializes in dog dna for a dna parentage test a lab will charge a fee per sample so you will be paying more or less depending on how many samples you need tested you will need to have access to your dog as well as the mother and father dogs that you want tested for parentage the test will tell you whether there is a match between your dog and the possible mother and father dogs you can also order a dna parentage test for an entire litter of dogs if you are managing a lot of dogs this will give you confidence that all of the puppies belong to the same parents laboratories sometimes offer a dna test to determine if there is any wolf or coyote dna in your dog this is often a separate test ask your veterinarian to help you order a dna profile for your dog getting a dna profile of your dog is a highly secure way of identifying your dog in the event of loss or illness if your dog is ever lost the profile will be invaluable as a way of ensuring any dog you find is actually your dog in the event of illness your dog s dna profile will also be crucial for determining that the correct sample is being used to test your dog for particular diseases you can order dna profiles from a variety of laboratories which your veterinarian will know in addition to the dna profile it is worthwhile microchipping your dog although your dog s dna profile is the most fool proof way of identifying your dog in the event of loss the microchip will be the faster method ask your veterinarian to insert a microchip between your dog s collarbones once you have figured out your dog s dna profile you should get it stored at the laboratory and at your veterinary office if your dog gets sick or lost the dna profile will be very useful you can collect the sample yourself using the dna test kit the swab will come in a collection tube using the swab included in your dna test take a swab from inside your dog s cheek rub it on the inside of your dog s cheek and underneath their tongue for sixty seconds take it out and put it in the collection tube you can collect the sample yourself but it will help to have your veterinarian direct the process you will need to use a swab to collect dna samples from the puppy mother and father if the puppy has been feeding from the mother you will need to separate them for a few minutes before taking the swab to avoid sending milk to the lab you should collect one sample at a time and write the names of the dogs on the sample tubes if you feel unsure about how to collect a sample of your dog s dna you could ask your veterinarian tell them you want to collect your dog s dna for a laboratory test to determine parentage ancestry or dna profile if you ordered a test you should bring the entire test kit to the veterinarian so they will have all of the details using the address given to you by the company mail your dna sample back to the laboratory once the company receives your dog s dna sample it will probably take them a few weeks to analyze it phone them to find out the processing time for your sample you can also get your veterinarian to send the sample to the laboratory review the details of the parentage profile summary including with relation to dna markers matches and inclusion or exclusion of possible parents figure out whether the test has positively identified specific parents as a dna match and whether any dogs have been excluded as possible parents if you are testing for multiple fathers you will probably find a complete dna match for only one father this will ensure you know the correct father or sire of the dog if neither parent is a match you will have to do another dna test look at the results of your dog s dna test analysis depending on the dna test you ordered these results may include information on the specific breeds in your dog s ancestry as well as information on types of breeds and fitness levels reflect on the relationship between the laboratory analysis and what you thought your dog s ancestry might be consider whether you are surprised or whether the results confirmed your suspicions with regards to the specific breeds in your dog s ancestry to further understand your

even be that your friend is carrying a diaper bag wherever they go even though they have no infants following them your first thought might be an urge to cure your friend searching the internet to do so instead of doing so have a second thought about your motivation is it because you think diapers gross you out or because you want to help your friend is most likely wearing diapers for a reason it is best to assume that doctors and experts have already tried their best if your friend has worn diapers for years your friend is most likely accustomed to wearing diapers and accepted themselves as someone who needs to wear diapers as part of their daily ritual again sharing the secret with you is a big step and is not the occasion for you to suggest a cure you found on the internet your friend most likely has tried it already and consulted experts unable to help diets and other easy cures are most likely not working and cause more stress than relief if your friend is comfortable with their life you are there to support as a friend leaving her his doctor to be in charge of any possible cure the answer to these questions could surprise you in how much you honestly care for your friend would you mind talking about your own underwear with this person if not you might be better off just going along waiting for your friend to start this conversation constantly talking about urine diapers or putting on songs relating to wet pants incontinence water or having your friends ring tone be one of those songs is not a good subtle way to get her him to start the conversation please respect if s he does not want to initiate the talk what is the goal of the conversation is it to have the person cut back on their diaper usage or completely rid themselves of their diapers or is it some other goal covered that deals with their diaper use do you want to be supportive and if so how much think honestly how much support you can give as diaper wearers and handling them will take a lot of psychological and physical help from friends and can be anywhere from helping them change their diaper to covering up their lie that they might not want exposed to others to shield the wearer from obvious psychological damage if they spread it to others who spread it even further turn off your phone to show you care about a private conversation let there be room for your friend to tell a sad story cry and confide in you without disturbances or other appointments coming up your friend might have had this conversation before and be confident about wearing diapers but it might also be the first time they have this conversation outside of close family read the rest of this guide consider the intimacy of the help you want to provide where your limits are as well as bring up situations where you have doubts on how to handle it express your friendship to and with them let your friend know that you like her him because of certain reasons including their personality and that wearing diapers does not change your viewpoints of your friendship with them in any way ask what word they would prefer you d use some prefer calling these absorbent pants diapers while others don t like the connotations these words give and prefer pads briefs or absorbent underwear sometimes however the wearer might not even like any of those terms to be used and would like another piece of clothing name to refer to it as find a word that suits you and your friend s level of discretion try on one of their diapers to see how your friend feels when wearing them if you can stomach the idea that you are wearing one and can be assumed to be able to take it off confidently without a fuss if you are a inquisitive person you might ask your friend if you can borrow a diaper to try it on yourself which can open the conversation to let your friend show their expertise and advice on their ability to wear a diaper and make them feel accepted and on equal footing with the remainder of the people in the world use the guide in how to wear a diaper to find out how you can wear a diaper like them ensure their diaper use isn t done due to other medical issues such as prostate problems or stress incontinence have their family talk to them and have their family bring them to a doctor who can treat and evaluate why they might even need their diapers to ensure theirs no other drastic reason that is curable but if left untreated can become quite a problem down the line in time many wearers may feel ashamed that their diapers will get exposed in public and that if not taken seriously the problem may get out of hand make sure they can count on you to help them handle life s emergencies while wearing it in public from shielding other s view of them to other issues about their use nan like underwear diapers have a tendency to show in the lower back after bending down to pick something up or when the person is just stretching this is enhanced by diapers having a higher waist and a plastic like back panel that can make it easy for shirts to slide up and uncover their diaper your friend most likely will not be aware of the diaper showing and just like a laundry instruction tag showing it is considered polite to tell your friend so the wardrobe malfunctioncan be adjusted use a code word to represent when this occurs to your friend your friend might appreciate if you don t say your diaper is showing out loud but you may agree on another more inconspicuous word that is less detrimental to their health like socks pants or some other term you could devise with them diapers can be tucked in the top rim of the diapers are made of plastic that will help to seal in the urine while they are lying down once tucked under and into the diaper itself it can become less conspicuous but that may create skin contact with the plastic which can result in itching and skin irritation to the wearer to decrease the height of the diaper rim it is better to bend this top part outwards letting the wearer s other clothing keep the diaper in a better place on their body offer to carry your friend s diaper bag although your friend may say on occasion that they can do it just being ready and caring can definitely mean a lot for your continued friendship to evolve it can be annoying always having to carry a bag with spare diapers and the supplies that go along with their diaper use and changing including carrying wet wipes and ointment offering to carry their bag eases not only the physical but also the psychological burden of carrying diapers your friend might say no but it at least is a nice gesture showing acceptance and willingness to help out although certain types of diapers have different absorbency rates and times that they tend to be most often worn towards between changes there is a difference between wet and dirty or just being wet or just being dirty and they all need to be changed some adult diapers are made to be worn comfortably for several hours including about a typical lifestyle of one to three hours for the thinly padded ones to ten to fourteen hours for the thickest padded ones a change is advised when the diaper is so wet it might leakafter soiling accidentswhen the diaper smells nobody nearby likes the emanating smell waterproof plastic pants can limit smell before starting a long trip with no access to restroomsbefore going for a bicycle ride your friend might not notice when they wet themselves having a friend to keep notice of their diapers problems is of great comfort during the ride you might also get to pick up on small subtle changes that your friend might not be aware of or has gotten used to as time has worn on while they wear their diapers it is not uncommon to get a bit grumpy when the diaper is soaked as the wetness is subconsciously felt and irritates but your friend might not feel that the diaper is wet as they are concentrating with the road ahead when cycling however back off from constant interrogation with them if they so desire it can feel rather intimidating disempowering and embarrassing to be confronted with your friend having wet the diaper and needing a change you need to have an agreement with your friend to know that it is okay with you to comment on their need to have their diaper changed by you and that you won t mention anything to anybody else what goes on in the room stays in the room having a code word might ease the situation i can smell your socks is less likely to attract attention than mentioning wet diapers or asking your friend if their diaper needs to be changed alternatively you can agree on a non verbal hint like a poke or tap on their body to tell your friend that you can smell their diaper without drawing attention from anyone else sometimes diaper wearers feel like they can t make it to the restroom in time so they wear their diaper if you can show them that they can make it in time you can get your friend to use the toilet and might even be able to save the diaper from even being used altogether if your friend invites you to shopping clothes together they will most likely want your input if her his diaper is showing or if the clothing actively hides the diaper and how visible it is you can use code words for this in order to keep it privately in the shop however before shopping be careful to check for their diaper being wet to ensure other clothes that you hadn t bought yet don t become wet and you ll be forced to purchase those pieces if you are comfortable talking about and buying menstrual pads or tampons with your friend it should also be possible to talk about buying plastic pants together otherwise let it be up to your friend to start that conversation plastic or rubber pants will decrease the smell sound risk of leaking and keep the diaper tight to the body making it less visible it is on the other hand a rather intimate thing for them to buy more so than buying regular underwear it is a piece of clothing only you and your friend s closest peers will see but it is also a garment that romantic partners or people looking up a skirt will see and hence is a crucial fashion accessory if plastic pants are worn it is also most likely that the leg gathers of these pants will show at the lower back when picking something up or stretching are all places where semi public nudity is expected and accepted leading to your friend having to be extra considerate of having their diaper showing talk with your friend about this before planning or paying these activities suggest the activity to your friend and listen to the reply one possibility might be for your friend to visit the toilet quite often before during and after the activity and wearing no or a very thin diaper this puts increased stress on your friend as s he has to be aware of the placement of the nearest toilet possibly wait in line and suddenly rush away to avoid accidents while biking usually does not include semi public nudity it does involve putting a lot of pressure on the diaper as well as bending the diaper out of the cup shape that is naturally forming while walking additionally bikes makes it harder to wear skirts an otherwise good female garment for making diapers less noticeable in case your friend suffers from fecal incontinence s he will have to wear a special swim diaper if you go to a swimming pool and as these garments are quite noticeable your friend will have to accept to show publicly that s he is wearing a diaper swim diapers should also be used on the beach although other references in pop and rock music both mention incontinence has become more common and is no longer taboo to wear diapers but it does not necessarily mean that your friend is ready to have it as public knowledge a talk among a group of friends can naturally turn this topic into something more irrational and cause great psychological pain for the wearer to get through and want them to wear diapers even more or even longer than originally planned depending on your friend they might get embarrassed about the topic and it is an option for you as their friend to steer the conversation towards another topic slipping into something more comfortable is common when the wearer gets home or is in a place that they are confident that the friend won t mention to others as the wearer is a frequent guest of with you finding out that they wear diapers this might also lead to the request of wearing thicker more comfortable diapers while you are the only one around because it gives better protection from leaks while resting or sitting down in one solitary spot or limiting movement another issue is heat and skin contact with plastic while plastic pants might be preferable in public they are hot and tight elastic bands can irritate the skin spending extended time with your friend at home s he most likely would prefer not to wear plastic pants leading to an increased risk of smell noise and leaks where the increased risk of leaking is mitigated by wearing a thicker diaper during the summer heat is a challenge as diapers act as extra insulation on the body where you can wear a thin pair of shorts or a skirt your friend still needs their diaper during parts of the summer where you want to wear as little clothing as possible to cool down your friend might request to wear nothing but a diaper if your friend requests for that let him her do it and see it as a good sign that s he is not embarrassed about wearing diapers a lot of kids are only in diapers on hot summer days as long as both of you don t mind that an occasional accident might happen your friend can avoid wearing the diaper altogether make sure your friend only sits on chairs with plastic covered seats and be prepared to remove any stains that occur from their nonuse of the diaper utilize how to remove urine odors and stains permanently to find out these steps while disposable diapers are most convenient thinner easier to change no dirty laundry to bring home they are a possibility in the privacy of the home cloth diapers absorb the urine in another way allowing the skin to breathe differently but may also make the wearer feel more wet and can absorb more particularly while sitting and lying on the side leading them to be less likely to leak offering a greater sense of security cloth diapers do tend to be more cumbersome to handle and as the plastic pants are in direct contact with the urine they need to either be reused after being dried off with paper towels or hand washed after they are replaced by a new pair diapers ointments wet wipes plastic pants take up a lot of space especially for extended stays as a typical day might require anywhere from three to five diaper changes if your friend comes to visit a lot it might be convenient if they can have a stash of diapers at your place so they don t have to carry a large diaper bag each and every time they visit you running out of diapers is a psychological burden leading your friend to most likely bring more diapers than needed in the diaper bag by having a stash somewhere in your house where only both of you have access to both of you know that they can stay longer and that you can have unplanned events without your friend suddenly needing to leave because a diaper change is required and having to travel home in a soaked diaper may risk a leak because no clean diapers were available when they were needed most if multiple people are attending talk with your friend about their her his preferences of wearing diapers all the time or just during the night of the sleepover and if they want the invitees to the party to know about their problem prepare a list of attendants and let your friend know who has rsvped and to make sure they know who is coming is coming diapers are put on differently when lying down than standing up going to sleep and turning around while sleeping requires a tighter fit around the legs when the wearer walks with one on the diaper forms a natural cup to keep in place the urine to the body while giving the legs the much needed room to move freely lying down while changing into a night diaper during the sleepover lets your friend put the diaper on much tighter as their thigh muscles are not flexed this brings up the situation where your friend might want to borrow your bed and have the room for themselves while changing into their night diaper you might want to bring up this issue with them in advance of the sleepover to have a talk about it in private and letting your friend know if they can or can not use your bed for your diaper change during the times of their sleepover while your bladder is full you may head to the toilet but your friend may feel differently when they wear their diaper and they feel the need to go due to peer pressure they may choose not to go and take it out on the diaper more quickly some embarrassing moments may be created when their diaper shows the leak on both their bed and any surround area as well as the stench of their urine in their diaper and the need for them to get out of their bed wearing their diaper and showing off the potential of the diaper use comfort your friend and have a talk about using larger diapers plastic or rubber pants another possibility is to get disposable mats or plastic rubber bedsheets to protect the bed next time removing the stain can be done by consulting how to remove urine odors and stains a lot of liquid is consumed during breakfast and the gravitational pull of standing up also creates an increased need to urinate this results in more urine during the first hour after having slept it is therefore an option to keep the night diaper on during breakfast and change afterwards to have a nice clean diaper for the rest of the day the alternative is to change right after having woken up and taken a shower but then the diaper is more likely to get as wet but not soaked during breakfast starting the day and leaving the house with a diaper that is already wet a lot of persons suffering from fecal incontinence will also experience a soiling accident within the first hour after getting up and letting them stay in their night diapers until the big accident occurs might be a good idea personal hygiene is important especially if your friend has slept for several hours and eaten breakfast wearing a wet diaper leading to your friend spending extra time in the shower it feels great getting clean in the morning and starting the day with a dry diaper not just a physical cleaning but a spiritual one feeling fresh and smelling good for the day to come this extra time needs to be taken into consideration when planning for the following morning and is not the time to talk about saving on the energy bill and the environment

attention to chronic constipation know that you re at risk if you re pregnant try to keep your weight at a healthy level consider whether your job could be the culprit understand how doctors diagnose hernias recognize an inguinal hernia this is the most common type of hernia and happens when the intestines or bladder push the lower abdominal wall into the groin and inguinal canal suspect a hiatal hernia in people over 50 look for umbilical hernias in babies be careful of incisional hernia after surgery recognize a femoral hernia in women report acute pain immediately if the hernia s symptoms come on suddenly the first thing the doctor will do is try to manage your pain consider getting elective surgery be aware of potential outcomes although hernias can happen to anyone certain factors might put you at a higher risk for herniation these may be chronic conditions or they may pass with time for example if you have a bad cough risk factors for hernias include increased abdominal pressurecoughingheavy liftingconstipationpregnancyobesityadvancing agesmokingsteroid use a hernia is an imperfection in the muscular container of an organ because of this imperfection the organ is pushed through an opening resulting in a hernia as the organ comes through the opening it will create a swollen area or bulge in the skin a hernia often gets bigger when you are standing or when you are straining the site of the swollen area may vary depending on what kind hernia you have the terms for different hernia types refer either to the location or the cause of the hernia inguinal these are hernias occurring in the inguinal region between the hip bone and crotch or groin umbilical occur around the belly buttonfemoral occur along the inner thighsincisional occur when incisions from prior surgeries create weak points in an organ s muscular containerdiaphragmatic or hiatal occur when there s a congenital defect in the diaphragm if the hernia affects your intestine it can change or even block the flow of food through your digestive system this can cause an intestinal back up that results in nausea and vomiting if the intestine is not completely blocked you may just see milder symptoms like nausea without vomiting or decreased appetite you may experience constipation if you suffer from an inguinal or femoral hernia low in the body constipation is in essence the exact opposite of vomiting when the flow of feces is blocked you may experience constipation instead of it all coming out it stays in needless to say this symptom necessitates immediate surgical intervention hernias can be very serious when they interfere with the functions your body needs in order to survive if you are experiencing any constipation see your doctor immediately many people with hernias don t have any complaints of pain or severe or significant noticeable symptoms but they may have a feeling of heaviness or fullness in the affected area especially in the abdomen you might chalk this up to complaints of bloating if nothing else you ll feel keenly aware of your abdominal area whether it s feeling full weak or just has a mysterious pressure you can relieve the bloating from hernias by resting in a reclined position though it s not always present pain is a sign of hernia especially if there are complications inflammation can cause a burning sensation or sharp pain pressure build up can result in a tearing pain that suggests the hernia is directly touching the muscle walls here s how pain affects hernias in different stages irreducible hernia the hernia cannot return to a normal state but instead gets larger you may feel occasional pain strangulated hernia the bulging organ is losing its blood supply and could be dead soon without medical attention you ll feel significant pain in this case along with nausea vomiting fever trouble moving your bowels this condition requires emergency surgery hiatal hernia the stomach bulges out of its cavity causing chest pains this also affects the flow of food causing acid reflux and making it hard to swallow untreated hernia hernias are usually painless and symptomless but if left untreated may cause pain and other health problems all hernias have the potential to become dangerous if you suspect you have one you need to see a doctor for evaluation as soon as possible he or she will determine whether you actually have one and also discuss its severity and your treatment options if you know you have a hernia and feel sudden throbbing or pain in the area go to the emergency room immediately the hernia could become strangulated and cut off blood supply which is highly dangerous according to studies even if a hernia that is present at birth which is common in newborn babies most of them are in male babies the same is true throughout adult life men s greater risk can be explained through a hernia s connection to having undescended testicles this is because a man s testicles descend through the inguinal canal shortly before birth a male s inguinal canal which holds the chords that connect with the testicles usually closes after birth in some cases though it does not close properly making hernias more likely some hereditary disorders affect connective tissues and muscles and leave you vulnerable to hernia keep in mind that this genetic likelihood only applies to hereditary defects in general there s no known genetic pattern for hernias if you have a history of hernias yourself you re at higher risk of having another one in the future cystic fibrosis a life threatening lung condition fills the lungs with thick mucus plugs patients with this condition develop a chronic cough as the body attempts to clear away the mucus plugs this increased pressure from coughing is a risk factor of having hernias this kind of cough puts so much pressure and force on your lungs that it damages the muscle walls patients feel pain and discomfort when coughing smokers are also at high risk for developing a chronic cough and are also more likely to develop hernias constipation forces you to strain your abdominal muscles when moving your bowels if you have weak abdominal muscles and are constantly forcing pressure against them you re more likely to develop a hernia weak muscles are caused by poor diet lack of exercise and old age straining when urinating can also put you at risk of having a hernia growing a baby in your uterus creates a lot of increased pressure inside your abdomen you re also increasing your abdominal weight which is a factor of developing hernias premature babies are also at risk of hernias because their muscles and tissues have not yet fully developed and strengthened genital defects in babies can stress the areas most likely to develop hernias these include abnormal position of the urethra fluid in the testicles and ambiguous genitalia the baby has genital characteristics of each sex obese or overweight people are more likely to develop hernias just like with pregnant women a larger belly increases abdominal pressure which can affect weak muscles if you re overweight it s advisable to start a weight loss plan now beware that large sudden weight loss from crash dieting weakens the muscles and causes hernias too if you lose weight lose it healthily and gradually you are at risk of herniation if your job demands long stretches of standing and a lot of physical strength some people vulnerable to work induced hernias include construction workers salesmen and women carpenters etc if this describes your current job talk to your employer you may be able to arrange a different situation that s less conducive to hernias during a physical examination for a hernia the doctor should always have you stand up while the he or she gently probes the swollen area you ll be asked to cough strain or perform a movement to the best of your ability the doctor will evaluate the flexibility and movement in the area where a hernia is suspected after assessment he or she will be able to diagnose whether you have one and what type of hernia you may have in men this canal holds chords that connect to the testicles and hernias are usually caused by a natural weakness in the canal in women the canal holds ligaments that keep the uterus in place there are two types of inguinal hernia direct and more commonly indirect direct inguinal hernia place your finger on the inguinal canal the crease along the pelvis where it meets the legs you will feel a bulge that pops out toward the front of the body and coughing will make the larger indirect inguinal hernia when you touch the inguinal canal you will feel a bulge going from outside towards the center of your body lateral to medial this bulge may also move down towards the scrotum hiatal hernias happen when the upper part of your stomach pushes through the opening of the diaphragm and into the chest this type of hernia usually happens in people over 50 years old though if a child has a hiatal hernia it s likely because of a birth defect the diaphragm is a thin sheet of muscle that helps you breathe it s also the muscle responsible for separating the organs in the abdomen and in the chest this kind of hernia causes burning sensations in the stomach chest pain and difficulty swallowing though they can occur later in life umbilical hernias commonly occur in newborns or babies less than 6 months old they happen when intestines push out in the abdominal wall near the belly button or the navel the bulge is especially noticeable when the child is crying with umbilical hernias you will see a bulge at the umbilicus or belly button umbilical hernias usually go away on their own but if it lasts until the child is 5 to 6 years old is very large or is causing symptoms the hernia may need surgery take note of the size small umbilical hernias around half an inch 1 25cm can go away on their own large umbilical hernias require surgery the incisions cuts performed during surgery take time to heal and scar over properly it also takes time for the surrounding muscles to regain their strength if organ tissue pushes out through the incision scar before it s healed an incisional hernia occurs it s most common in elderly and overweight patients place gentle but firm pressure near the surgical site with your fingers you should feel a bulge somewhere in the area while femoral hernias can happen to both men and women the vast majority of cases occur in women because of their wider pelvic shape in the pelvis there s a canal that carries arteries veins and nerves into the upper inner thigh this canal is normally a tight space but it often becomes larger if the woman is pregnant or obese when it stretches out it becomes weak and thus vulnerable to potential hernias in the case of an incarcerated hernia the doctor may first try to physically push the hernia back into its original position this can reduce the acute inflammation and swelling and provide more time to allow for an elective surgical repair strangulated hernias need immediate surgery to avoid tissue cell death and organ tissue puncture even if the hernia is not terribly dangerous your doctor may recommend elective surgery to repair it before it progresses to a more dangerous state studies have shown that preemptive elective surgery lower morbidity and mortality significantly depending on the type of hernia and the individual patient there s a wide range in the likelihood of a hernia recurring groin pediatric these hernias have a low recurrence rate of 3 after surgical treatment they can sometimes heal spontaneously on their own in infants groin adult depending on the experience level of the surgeon operating on this hernia the recurrence rate after surgery can be anywhere from 0 10 incisional about 3 5 of patients will have a hernia recurrence after their first surgery if the incisional hernias are larger patients may see rates of up to 20 60 umbilical pediatric these types of hernias can usually resolve on their own spontaneously umbilical adult there is a higher recurrence of umbilical hernias in adults usually a patient can expect up to 11 recurrence rate after surgery

antibiotics used for kidney infection include ciprofloxacin and a combination of amoxycillin and clavulanic which is called augmentin if you are taking antibiotics for a kidney infection you should rest as much as possible take work or school off and rest so that your body can heal itself do not do any heavy lifting and try to stay put in a bed or on the couch getting rest will speed up your recovery process and help the antibiotic medication to do its job the more hydrated you are the more urine your body will produce if the kidney stone you are dealing with is small enough filling your body with water and other fluids could flush the stone out with your urine drink upwards of 10 glasses of water a day to really hydrate yourself and see if you can flush the stone out if you get bored drinking water add some fruit juice like lemon to the water to give it some flavor you could also drink hydration sports drinks like gatorade or powerade coconut water is also a good option for hydration there are some medications that can enter your system and break down your kidney stone one of these medications is allopurinol which can break down uric acid stones if your kidney stones are too large for medication to have much of an effect your doctor may also suggest extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy eswl to break up the kidneys during this procedure high energy sound waves are sent through the spot where your kidney stone is the kidney stone will get broken up but the rest of your body will remain unharmed if you have a horseshoe kidney it s a good idea to set up regular appointments with your doctor to make sure that you do not have any tumors developing doctors use ultrasounds to check out your kidney and make sure that it is tumor free you may want to consider setting appointments up for every six months or so just to be on the safe side talk to your doctor about the amount of visits he or she thinks is necessary based on your medical history your doctor will take your age health and medical history into consideration when determining the best way to fight the cancer the two most common forms of treatment are chemotherapy and radiation your doctor may also choose to do a combination of both therapies surgery should only be considered as a last resort if you are suffering from several conditions due to your horseshoe kidney the risk of the surgery done to separate the two kidneys is actually very high so it is only done in very severe cases for the most part surgery is done to fix conditions caused by horseshoe kidney and is done less often to actually separate the kidneys the surgery to separate a horseshoe kidney involves three separate surgeries in which a surgeon will work to separate repair damage and reconstruct your kidneys if you suffer from frequent kidney stones and choose to have your kidneys surgically separated the surgeon will remove your kidney stones at the same time again having surgery done to separate kidneys is risky so you should consider getting the kidney stones removed via medication and safer surgical practices see method 2 for more information if a kidney tumor particularly a cancerous tumor is found it will have to be removed surgically to make sure that it does not cause your kidney further complications talk to your doctor about the different procedures available and what would work best for you based on your medical history during a kidney tumor removal the tumor will be dissected and the surrounding tissue will be removed ureteropelvic junction upj obstruction can occur in people who have horseshoe kidney because your kidneys are joined your ureter the duct that carries urine from your kidney to your bladder can be in a position where it becomes bent or kinked surgery will be done to correct this so that your urine can flow in a normal way through your body it is important to get surgery if you have upj obstruction because it can cause your kidney to dilate open up and can lead to cause abdominal pains nausea side back pain weakness and severe colic you may also see blood in your urine it can also lead to a series of kidney infections 
query	81	solve equations with variables on both sides when beginning to study algebra you will see equations that have a variable on one side but later on you will often see equations that have variables on both sides the most important thing to remember when solving such equations is that whatever you do to one side of the equation you must do to the other side using this rule it is easy to move variables around so that you can isolate them and use basic operations to find their value solving equations with one variable on both sides solving system equations with two variables solving example problems apply the distributive property if necessary cancel the variable on one side of the equation keep the equation balanced simplify the equation by combining like terms move the constants to one side of the equation if necessary cancel the variable s coefficient check your work isolate a variable in one equation substitute the value of the isolated variable into the other equation solve for the variable solve for the remaining variable try this problem using the distributive property with one variable 5 x 4 6x 5 displaystyle 5 x 4 6x 5 try this problem involving a

states that a b c ab ac displaystyle a b c ab ac this rule allows you to cancel out parentheses by multiplying each term in the parentheses by the number outside the parentheses for example if your equation is 2 10 2x 4 2x 2 displaystyle 2 10 2x 4 2x 2 use the distributive property to multiply the terms in parentheses by the number outside the parentheses 2 10 2x 4 2x 2 displaystyle 2 10 2x 4 2x 2 20 4x 8x 8 displaystyle 20 4x 8x 8 to cancel the variable complete the opposite operation as stated in the equation for example if the term is subtracted in the equation cancel it by adding if the term is added in the equation cancel it by subtracting it is usually easiest to cancel the variable with the smaller coefficient for example in the equation 20 4x 8x 8 displaystyle 20 4x 8x 8 cancel the term 4x displaystyle 4x by adding 4x displaystyle 4x 20 4x 4x 8x 8 displaystyle 20 4x 4x 8x 8 whatever you do to one side of the equation you must do to the other side as well so if you add or subtract to cancel the variable on one side of the equation you must add or subtract to the other side as well for example if you added 4x displaystyle 4x on one side of the equation to cancel the variable you must also add 4x displaystyle 4x to the other side of the equation 20 4x 4x 8x 8 4x displaystyle 20 4x 4x 8x 8 4x you should now have the variable on one side of the equation for example 20 4x 4x 8x 8 4x displaystyle 20 4x 4x 8x 8 4x 20 12x 8 displaystyle 20 12x 8 you want the variable term on one side and the constant on the other side to move the constant to one side add or subtract from each side of the equation to cancel the term on one side for example to cancel the 8 displaystyle 8 constant on the variable side subtract 8 from both sides of the equation 20 12x 8 displaystyle 20 12x 8 20 8 12x 8 8 displaystyle 20 8 12x 8 8 12 12x displaystyle 12 12x to do this perform the operation opposite from the one denoted in the equation usually this will mean dividing to cancel a coefficient being multiplied by a variable remember that whatever you do to one side of the equation you must do to the other side of the equation as well for example to cancel out the coefficient 12 from the equation you would divide each side of the equation by 12 12 12x displaystyle 12 12x 1212 12x12 displaystyle frac 12 12 frac 12x 12 1 x displaystyle 1 x to make sure your answer is correct

already be done if not use the rules of algebra to isolate the variable on one side of the equation remember that whatever you do to one side of the equation you must do to the other side for example for the equation y 1 x 1 displaystyle y 1 x 1 to isolate the y displaystyle y variable you would subtract 1 from both sides y 1 x 1 displaystyle y 1 x 1 y 1 1 x 1 1 displaystyle y 1 1 x 1 1 y x 2 displaystyle y x 2 make sure you substitute the entire expression for the variable this will give you an equation with only one variable allowing you to solve for the variable for example if your first equation is 2x 20 2y displaystyle 2x 20 2y and you determined y x 2 displaystyle y x 2 in the second equation you would substitute x 2 displaystyle x 2 for y displaystyle y in the first equation 2x 20 2y displaystyle 2x 20 2y 2x 20 2 x 2 displaystyle 2x 20 2 x 2 to do this move the variable to one side of the equation then move the constants to one side of the equation then isolate the

4x 24 displaystyle 4x 24 4x4 244 displaystyle frac 4x 4 frac 24 4 x 6 displaystyle x 6 to do this plug the value of the variable you already solved into one of the equations this will give you an equation with only one variable solve for the variable using the rules of algebra you can use either equation to solve for the remaining variable for example if you found that x 6 displaystyle x 6 you can substitute 6 for x displaystyle x in the second equation y x 2 displaystyle y x 2 y 6 2 displaystyle y 6 2 y 4 displaystyle y 4 plug the values for both variables into one of the equations if the

query	82	know if you have laryngitis laryngitis is when your voice box or larynx is inflamed 1 in laryngitis the voice box is irritated and your voice may become hoarse or even disappear 2 in many cases laryngitis is a minor temporary condition caused by a recent cold or illness however laryngitis may also be a chronic condition that is a sign of more serious medical conditions 3 know the risk factors and symptoms of laryngitis to determine whether your larynx may be inflamed recognizing the symptoms knowing the risk factors of acute laryngitis knowing the risk factors of chronic laryngitis seeking a laryngitis diagnosis pay attention to the quality of your voice take note of a dry cough notice a throat that is dry sore or full feeling take your temperature consider whether you have recently experienced cold or flu symptoms notice any breathing difficulty feel your throat for lumps consider how well you are swallowing mark how long you are feeling hoarse on a calendar know what acute laryngitis is recognize that a viral infection is the most common cause be aware that bacterial infections may cause acute laryngitis consider whether you have recently overused your voice know what chronic laryngitis is recognize that airborne irritants can lead to chronic laryngitis be aware that gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd can cause laryngitis watch your alcohol consumption recognize that voice overuse can lead to chronic laryngitis make an appointment with a physician provide a full medical history say aaaaaah submit to more invasive tests follow your doctor s treatment recommendations having a voice that is hoarse scratchy or weak is the first sign that you have laryngitis your voice becomes rough hoarse or gravelly sounding or sometimes too soft or quiet in acute laryngitis there is a swelling of vocal cords that impairs the normal vibration ask yourself do you notice any scratching or vocal fry when you speak does your voice sound more gravelly than usual does your voice give out or soften when you don t want it to has your voice changed pitch is it higher or lower than usual is it hard to raise your voice above a whisper be aware that a change in your voice may also occur after a stroke when the vocal cords are paralyzed you may find that you re unable to speak at all however there will be other symptoms such as deviation of angle of mouth weakness of limbs drooling and difficulty in swallowing etc irritation of the vocal cords will provoke the desire to cough however a cough caused by laryngitis will be dry instead of wet this is because a laryngitis cough is restricted to the upper airway but not the lower airway where sputum is produced if your cough is wet and produces sputum you most likely do not have a case of laryngitis you might have a cold or other virus however these viruses have the potential to turn into laryngitis after a while laryngitis can also cause painful or uncomfortable symptoms in the throat you may feel a fullness or rawness in your throat because of the swelling of the walls of the nasopharynx the junction between your airway and the food passage or throat ask yourself does my throat hurt when i swallow or eat do i feel the urge to clear my throat constantly does my throat feel tickly or scratchy does my throat feel dry or raw some cases of laryngitis are caused by an infection in this case you might also experience a low or moderate grade fever take your temperature to see if you are running a fever if so then you might be experiencing a viral laryngitis your fever will likely resolve itself in a few days though your throat symptoms will likely last longer than thatif the fever persists or gets worse you should seek medical attention promptly because it may be a sign of pneumonia you should also contact a doctor immediately if your temperature hits 103 degrees fahrenheit or higher laryngitis symptoms often last for several days or weeks after you have recovered from a cold flu or other virus if you have current throat symptoms and also had viral symptoms within the last two weeks that is a signal that you have laryngitis such symptoms include a runny noseheadachefeverfatiguebody aches and pains breathing difficulty can occur during laryngitis especially in young children if you or your child is short of breath cannot breathe normally while lying down or makes a high pitched sound while breathing in stridor this is a sign of laryngitis this is also an emergency situation that will require immediate medical attention call your doctor immediately chronic laryngitis can sometimes be accompanied by the development of lumps polyps or nodules in or near your vocal cords if you feel as if there is a lump blocking your throat that is a sign that you have laryngitis and should see a doctor right away in many cases this feeling of having a lump in your throat is due to chronic laryngitis caused by acid reflux disease the sensation may provoke a desire to clear the throat if you do have this urge try to resist it clearing your throat aggravates the condition the more severe cases of laryngitis can cause a difficulty in swallowing other more serious medical conditions associated with laryngitis might also lead to difficulty swallowing for example if there is a large tumor or lump inside the larynx it may compress the food tube esophagus and lead to difficulty in swallowing this is a symptom that requires immediate medical attention in laryngitis due to gastroesophageal reflux disease there will be chronic irritation of the esophagus by stomach acid consequently there may be ulcers in the esophagus that lead to swallowing difficulty many people experience hoarseness every now and again however if the laryngitis is a chronic condition it will last for more than two weeks take note of how long you are feeling hoarse on a calendar share with your doctor how long your symptoms persist this will allow your doctor to determine whether your laryngitis is acute or chronic voice hoarseness is characterized by a low raspy voice which tires easily there are other causes of chronic hoarseness besides laryngitis a tumor in the chest or neck may compress the nerves leading to hoarseness other symptoms of a tumor include long term cough bloody sputum weight loss appetite loss swelling of the face and arms etc consult a doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms alongside your laryngitis this is the most common type of laryngitis it is sudden in onset and reaches its peak severity within one to two days the condition usually starts to subside after a few days and you will feel much better at the end of the week most people experience acute laryngitis at some point in their lives usually laryngitis is preceded by a respiratory infection such as the common cold flu or sinusitis acute laryngitis can continue for many days after the other symptoms of the infection subside you may infect other people by spreading droplets with coughing or sneezing practice proper hygiene to avoid infecting others while rarer than viral causes certain bacterial infections may also cause laryngitis these include bacterial pneumonia bronchitis or diphtheria in this case you might require antibiotics in order to shake your laryngitis another cause of acute laryngitis is the sudden overuse of your vocal cords shouting singing or speaking at length may cause fatigue and swelling of the vocal cords those who use their voices often for work or in their hobbies might be at risk of developing chronic laryngitis from voice overuse however sometimes voice overuse can lead to temporary laryngitis as well some common causes of acute laryngitis from voice overuse include yelling to be heard at a barcheering at a sporting eventsinging loudly without proper trainingtalking or singing loudly in a location filled with smoke or other irritants if the inflammation persists more than two three weeks then it is called chronic laryngitis usually the voice change develops gradually over a period of few weeks the condition often gets worse with prolonged use of the voice box in some cases chronic laryngitis is an indicator of more serious medical conditions long term inhalation of irritant substances like chemical fumes smoke and allergens are all reported causes of chronic laryngitis smokers firefighters and those who work with chemicals are at particular risk for chronic laryngitis you should also avoid exposure to allergens when your body experiences an allergic reaction all the tissues will suffer inflammation including the larynx if you know you are allergic to a substance try to avoid having that substance in your home to ensure that you do not experience chronic laryngitis the most common cause of chronic laryngitis is gerd or acid reflux disease gerd patients experience a backflow of stomach acids into the esophagus and mouth as a gerd patient breathes the liquid content may be aspirated inadvertently which irritates the larynx chronic irritation causes swelling of the vocal cords that may change your voice gerd is a condition that is treatable with dietary changes and medication consult your doctor if you have chronic laryngitis caused by acid reflux disease consuming alcohol relaxes the muscles in your larynx making your voice hoarse prolonged alcohol intake can irritate the mucous membrane of the larynx causing laryngitis alcohol overconsumption might also exacerbate acid reflux disease and is a risk factor for certain throat cancers these conditions might also lead to chronic laryngitis those who are singers teachers bartenders or public speakers are at particular risk of developing chronic laryngitis overusing your voice can cause fatigue and thickening of vocal cords misusing your voice might also lead to the development of a polyp or an unusual growth of tissue on a mucous membrane when polyps develop on the vocal cords they can irritate the voice box causing laryngitis if you are in a profession that is at a high risk of chronic laryngitis consider taking special speech therapy or voice lessons to train yourself to speak in a way that is easy on your vocal cords it is also wise for you to rest your voice on days when it is not absolutely necessary for you to talk yell or sing if your laryngitis symptoms persist or if you experience any particularly worrying symptoms such as having difficulty breathing or swallowing you should call your doctor right away depending on the severity of your condition you might see your regular physician or you might be referred to an ear nose and throat specialist the first step in a diagnosis will be to take your full medical history your doctor will likely ask about the demands of your profession allergies medications other symptoms you experience and about any recent infections you have had this is the first step in determining whether or not you have laryngitis and whether your case is acute or chronic your doctor will likely ask about symptoms of common medical ailments that lead to chronic laryngitis such as acid reflux alcohol use and chronic allergies your doctor will have to examine your throat and vocal cords visually with the aid of a mirror by opening your mouth and saying aaaaaah your doctor will have a better view of these organs your doctor will be on the lookout for abnormal bumps lesions polyps swelling and colors that can help lead her to a diagnosis if your doctor suspects a bacterial cause for your laryngitis you might also have to provide a throat culture your doctor will lightly swab the back of your throat and send it to the lab for testing this leads to an unpleasant but very brief sensation in the throat most likely your laryngitis is acute and will not require any further testing however if your doctor is concerned about the possibility of chronic laryngitis cancer or other serious conditions you might have to undergo more serious tests to determine the severity of your condition these include a laryngoscopy in this procedure your doctor will use a light and mirror to examine how your vocal cords move your doctor may also insert a small thin cable with a camera into your nose or mouth to get a better visual of your vocal cords while you speak a biopsy if your doctor suspects that you have precancerous or cancerous cells she might perform a biopsy of your vocal cords she will remove a sample of cells from the suspicious area and examine them under a microscope to determine whether they are healthy or unhealthy cells a chest x ray this is most commonly done for children who have severe laryngitis symptoms a chest x ray can help determine whether there is any concerning swelling or blockages depending on the cause and severity of your laryngitis your doctor may have different recommendations for how to treat your condition in many cases your doctor will recommend the following rest your voice avoid loud talking or singing until your laryngitis has resolved do not whisper whispering is harsher on your vocal cords than regular talking speak softly but resist the urge to whisper do not clear your throat even when your throat feels dry full or scratchy resist the urge to clear it that just puts more pressure on your vocal cords stay hydrated keep yourself well hydrated by drinking plenty of water and herbal tea this will also help lubricate and soothe your sore throat use a humidifier or vaporizer inject moisture into the air in order to ease your symptoms and help your vocal cords to repair themselves using a humidifier or vaporizer overnight while you sleep is an excellent step to take you can also take frequent hot showers in order to breathe in the steam avoid alcohol alcohol is acidic and puts unneeded pressure on vocal cords stay away from alcoholic beverages while you are experiencing laryngitis reducing your alcohol intake can also help prevent future bouts of laryngitis avoid decongestants decongestants can help when you have a wet cough caused by a cold however they exacerbate the dry cough characteristic of laryngitis never take a decongestant if you suspect you have laryngitis quit smoking smoking is one of the leading causes of chronic laryngitis and it can lead to much more serious conditions such as throat cancer quit smoking as soon as you can in order to prevent vocal cord damage soothe your throat herbal teas honey salt water gargles and throat lozenges are all excellent ways to soothe a throat that is sore due to laryngitis seek acid reflux treatment if your laryngitis is caused by acid reflux your doctor will likely provide dietary recommendations and medications to ease your symptoms for example you should eat smaller meals avoid eating before bedtime and avoid acidic foods and beverages such as alcohol chocolate tomatoes or coffee take voice lessons if you need your voice for your profession you may be able to take lessons in order to learn how to use your voice properly many singers for example require lessons in order to learn how to project their voices without putting undue strain on their vocal cords take prescription medication if your laryngitis is caused by bacteria you might require antibiotics if your vocal cords are severely swollen in a way that impacts your ability to eat or breathe you might require steroids to reduce the inflammation

query	84	read guitar tabs guitarists have their own special system of music notation called guitar tablature or guitar tabs for short using guitar tabs a guitarist can play a wide variety of music without ever having to learn how to read standard sheet music though guitar tabs aren t a perfect way of describing music they ve allowed newer generations of guitarists to quickly and easily share information about how to play songs across the globe via the internet every guitarist should have at least a basic understanding of how to read tablature it s the de facto shorthand for much of the guitar music you ll find written out online using tabs to fret notes and chords reading special symbols reading an example tab view tab notation as a representation of the guitar s strings use the numbers on the tab to fret spaces on the neck play vertically stacked numbers at the same time proceed from left to right look for lyrics or chord changes look for additional symbols in the tab learn the symbol for hammer ons learn the symbol for pull offs learn the symbol for string bends learn the symbols for slide techniques learn the symbols for tremolo bar techniques learn the symbol for vibrato learn the symbols for muting techniques learn the symbol for tapping learn the symbols for harmonic techniques learn the symbol for trills learn the symbol for tremolo picking glance over the tab below start with the chord at the far left proceed to the next two chords play the individual notes at the right put it all together a tab is usually written using six horizontal lines each corresponding with a string on the guitar the bottom line represents the lowest thickest string while the top string represents the highest thinnest string for standard tunings this means that the lines will represent from the bottom up the low e a d g b and high e strings e thinnest string b g d a e thickest string unlike normal musical notation guitar tabs don t tell you which notes to play instead they tell you where to put your fingers numbers on the lines correspond to frets on the fretboard each number represents a specific fret on the line it s written on for instance a 1 on the bottom line means to fret the first fret of the lowest string and play that note if the number is greater than 0 1 2 3 4 etc then press your finger on that fret when you play with 1 being the fret closest to the stock and fret numbers increasing as you move towards the guitar s body if the number is 0 then pluck the open string without fretting any notes when reading tabs many times you ll come across numbers that are aligned vertically these are chords fret every note in the chord as written then play the notes all at the same time you ll get a fuller sound than you might see the chord name written as well see example 2 below tabs are read like sentences in a book read them from left to right across the page dropping down to the next line only when you ve reached the end of the previous play the notes and chords in sequence as you read them from left to right note that most but not all tabs don t display the rhythm with which you should play the notes in the tab they may break the tab into measures usually signified by vertical lines in the tab between measures but they won t tell you the rhythm of the notes within the measures in this case it s best to listen to the song while you read the tab to find the beat some advanced tabs do count out the beat for you this is usually done by including rhythmic markings along the top of the tab notation each marking is vertically aligned with a note or a rest to give a sense of how long the note or rest lasts typical rhythmic markings include w whole note h half note q quarter note e eighth note s sixteenth note sometimes markings are included to show that a note or rest lies on the and of a certain beat a dot after the rhythm marking means the corresponding note or rest is dotted for instance q dotted quarter note for rhythm basics see how to read music many songs have guitar parts made up solely or mostly of chords this is especially true for rhythm guitar parts in this case the tab may forgo typical tab notation in favor of a simplified list of chord changes these chords are almost always written in standard chord notation amin a minor e7 e dominant 7 etc simply play the chords in the order that they re listed if it s not noted otherwise try playing one chord per measure but if the changes don t sound right listen to the song for the strumming pattern sometimes these chord changes are printed above the lyrics of the song to give you a sense of when these chords are played as in this snippet from a tab for the beatles twist and shout a7 d g a well shake it up baby now shake it up baby as you can see in the example above many tabs aren t just collections of lines and notes tabs use a wide variety of special symbols to tell you how to play the notes in the tab most symbols refer to specific playing techniques to make a song sound as much like the recording as possible pay attention to these special markings in a tab an h inserted between two notes e g 7h9 means to perform a hammer on to hammer on play the first note normally then use a finger on your fretting hand to tap down on the second note without using your strumming hand to pluck the note sometimes is used instead e g 7 9 a p inserted between two notes e g 9p7 means to perform a pull off which is essentially the opposite of a hammer on pluck the first note while using another finger to fret the second note then quickly lift the finger fretting the first note the second note will sound as with hammer ons sometimes is used instead e g 9 7 in this case know to perform a pull off if the second note is lower and a hammer on if the second note is higher if a b is inserted between two fret numbers e g 7b9 fret the first note and bend it up until it sounds like the second sometimes the second number is in parentheses and occasionally the b is omitted altogether if there is an r it denotes what the note should be released to e g 7b9r7 perform a basic slide by striking a note moving your finger up or down a string without releasing it from the fretboard then striking another note an ascending slide is marked by a forward slash and a descending slide is marked by a backwards slash e g 7 9 7 a lowercase s usually means to perform a legato slide this is like a normal slide but you only strike the first note with your pick let your target note sound simply from the motion in your fret hand there is debate among guitarists over whether a light pick strike is appropriate for the target note the most important thing is to remember to leave no gap between notes shift slides are signified by an uppercase s in this case strike the target note without striking the initial note of the slide if your guitar has a tremolo bar also known as a whammy bar or vibrato bar follow these symbols to achieve some remarkably out there effects if you see a n where n some number perform a tremolo bar dip quickly hit and release the bar to dip the note s pitch the number between the slashes gives an indication of the pitch you should dip to dip the pitch by n semitones a semitone is the same as the pitch between two adjacent frets for instance 5 means to drop the pitch by 5 semitones which will be the same tone as 5 frets below the original note if you see a n where n some number fret note n then strike it and depress the tremolo bar deeply to dramatically drop the pitch if you see n raise the tremolo bar up after striking note n to raise the pitch on some guitars you can also put your bar in inverted position first so that hitting the bar raises the pitch rather than lowers it if you see n perform a tremolo bar inverted dip by first depressing the tremolo bar then raising it as above this also works in inverted position look for or v if you see these symbols perform vibrato on the preceding note strike the note then use your fretting hand to rapidly bend and unbend the string vibrating the pitch of the note several tab symbols indicate different methods for giving notes a muted sound if you see an x or a dot below the number mute the string lay your fretting hand finger s across the designated strings so that when you strike them they produce a dull clicking sound several x in a row on adjacent strings indicates a rake just mute more than one string at once if you see pm play using palm muting for standard right handed guitar playing gently lay the edge of your right palm across the strings near the guitar s bridge when you strike the notes with the same hand as is providing the mute you should hear the tone of the note but with a subdued dead quality move your hand slightly up the strings toward the neck to deaden the notes more tapping is usually represented by a t if you see a t in a string of notes e g 2h5t12p5p2 use one of the fingers on your picking hand usually your right hand to tap down hard on the indicated fret this is a useful technique for making very rapid fast changes in pitch guitar tabs differentiate between several different techniques for playing harmonics bell like tones created by special fretting techniques for natural harmonics the fret is surrounded by e g 7 if you see this lay a fretting finger across the metal line at the right of the fret not the middle of the fret then strike the string for a clear bell tone pinch harmonics are signified by surrounding the fret number in brackets e g to perform a pinch harmonic strike the note with your pick hand while your pick hand thumb is also touching the note use vibrato from your fret hand to add sustain to the tone pinch harmonics are difficult it requires lots of practice note these are best performed on an electric guitar with distortion using a bridge pickup tapped harmonics are signified by two notes the second enclosed in parentheses e g n n tapped harmonics are like natural harmonics but shifted around the neck fret the first note then use a finger on your pick hand to slap or strike the string at the second fret position when you see a tr written in or above the tab it s usually between or above two notes often it s accompanied by a string of tildes s this simply means to strike the first note then rapidly hammer on to the second note and pull off to the first note again and again tp means you should tremolo pick the note essentially pick the single note over and over as rapidly as you can sometimes a tp symbol is followed by a string of tildes or dashes to give you a sense of how long to tremolo pick notice that it shows several three note chords as well as some individual notes descending on the higher strings in the following steps we ll walk through this tab beat by beat e 3 0 b 3 0 g 7 7 7 2 0 d 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 a 2 5 5 5 7 7 7 e 0 5 5 5 in this case first you would play a power chord in e middle finger finger 2 on the second fret on the a string ring finger finger 3 on the second fret on the d string and no finger on the low e string strumming those first 3 strings e a d once play the chord highlighted with parentheses below e 3 0 b 3 0 g 777 2 0 d 2 777 777 a 2 555 777 e 0 555 the next chord you would play would be a power chord on the fifth fret of a three times so you would play with your index finger on the fifth fret of a your middle finger on the seventh fret of d and your ring finger on the seventh fret of g then simply shift this finger shape down one string so that your index finger is on the fifth fret of the e string with your other fingers on the seventh frets of the a and d strings play the chords in the sequence that they re highlighted with parentheses below e 3 0 b 3 0 g 7 77 2 0 d 2 7 77 777 a 2 5 55

finger on the third fret of the high e string pluck once then play the open high e string and so on through the six descending notes play the notes below in the order they re highlighted in parentheses e 3 0 b 3 0 g 7 7 7 2 0 d 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 a 2 5 5 5 7 7 7 e 0 5 5 5 e 3 0 b 3 0 g 7 7 7 2 0 d 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 a 2 5 5 5 7 7 7 e 0 5 5 5 e 3 0 b 3 0 g 7 7 7 2 0 d 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 a 2 5 5 5 7 7 7

query	85	spot distributive shock symptoms distributive shock is when an abnormality of the small blood vessels leads to an improper distribution of blood throughout the body this can cause life threatening signs of shock and an impaired delivery of oxygen to the body s vital organs to spot distributive shock you will need to know the general signs and symptoms of shock to look out for you will also need to know what specifically can cause distributive shock as opposed to other forms of shock determining the underlying cause of distributive shock is key to effectively managing it and to having the best chances of saving the person s life if you are worried that you or someone else is showing signs of distributive shock proceed to the emergency room immediately assessing the symptoms assessing the patient s medical history performing diagnostic tests check for an elevated heart rate all types of shock including distributive shock typically present with a faster than normal heart rate over 100 beats per minute observe an increased respiratory rate in addition to an elevated heart rate all types of shock also typically present with rapid respiration feel for warm extremities in distributive shock specifically which includes septic shock a person s extremities hands and feet will typically be warmer than usual notice decreased urination in shock because the body perceives a lack of effective blood flow and oxygenation it will seek to conserve fluids evaluate for a fever because infection sepsis is the number one cause of distributive shock it is key to test for the presence of a fever look for signs of confusion shock typically presents with confusion and often with a decreased level of consciousness measure blood pressure in shock the blood pressure is lower than normal take note of an infection preceding the onset of shock the number one reason for someone to go into distributive shock is due to an infection that gets worse and spreads to the bloodstream called sepsis consider the possibility of anaphylaxis another reason for someone to go into distributive shock is due to anaphylaxis a systemic allergic reaction which may occur in response to a bee sting or other allergy assess for other common causes of distributive shock other common causes of distributive shock include sirs systemic inflammatory response syndrome pancreatitis kidney problems called addisonian crisis burns toxic shock syndrome most common in women who are menstruating who have left a tampon in for too long and neurogenic shock a subtype of distributive shock caused by a spinal cord injury that results in decreased blood vessel tone test for lactic acidosis a blood test for lactate can indicate the presence of lactic acidosis evaluate white blood cell counts measuring white blood cells via a blood test is also very helpful in assessing for the presence of an infection which is the leading cause of distributive shock assess vital organ function opt for other diagnostic tests as needed to determine the underlying cause begin treatment you can take someone s pulse or listen to their heart with a stethoscope to determine their heart rate in distributive shock when you feel the pulse at the person s extremities wrists and or ankles you are likely to feel a bounding pulse a bounding pulse is a stronger more forceful pulse than normal it is due to the increased total blood volume in distributive shock from the vasodilatory effects that occur in sepsis or anaphylaxis among other things the bounding pulse may be felt early but as the shock progresses the pulse will become weak or absent in the extremities this is because the fundamental problem in shock is lack of oxygen delivery to the body s vital organs therefore the body tries to compensate for the lack of oxygen by breathing more rapidly greater than 20 breaths per minute is considered an elevated respiratory rate this is because distributive shock perhaps counter intuitively presents with more blood than normal in the circulatory system however the blood is distributed inappropriately throughout the body leading to inadequate circulation to the vital organs and excess blood flow to the extremities and to areas of the body that do not need it as a result urine output will decrease leading to infrequent urination a temperature greater than 38 degrees celsius 100 4 degrees fahrenheit may be indicative of an infection a temperature less than 36 degrees celsius 96 8 degrees fahrenheit is also of concern as sometimes the body can present with a reduced temperature rather than with a fever this is due to the decreased effectiveness of blood flow and oxygenation throughout the body in more severe cases the person may even be unconscious it is typically below 90 mm hg systolic and it may even be undetectable in distributive shock even though more blood than normal is shunted to the extremities the arms and legs the blood vessels have dilated and as such the blood pressure reading still tends to be low therefore if you are trying to recognize distributive shock ask about and assess for any recent or current infections the most common infections that can lead to shock include pneumonias genitourinary infections and abdominal infections people often carry an epipen epinephrine pen if they have been diagnosed with allergies that may lead to anaphylaxis and or distributive shock inquire if there was exposure to a triggering allergen before the onset of shock nan lactic acidosis is an indication that the body s vital organs are not getting enough blood flow and oxygen which if not resolved could lead to multi organ failure the degree of lactic acidosis therefore is a way to measure the severity of shock symptoms white blood cells can also be elevated in other inflammatory conditions that may underlie distributive shock if an infection septic shock is suspected as the cause of distributive shock blood cultures can also be taken a blood culture can grow the bacteria or other microbe that is causing the infection allowing doctors to choose an appropriate antibiotic or other antimicrobial agent depending upon the cause of the infection for treatment because the consequence of shock that is trying to be avoided is vital organ failure it is key to assess the function of vital organs organs to test include kidney functionliver functionheart functionpancreas function as pancreatitis can actually be a cause of distributive shock if distributive shock or any other form of shock is suspected or diagnosed clinically it is key to identify the underlying cause so that it can be resolved additional diagnostic tests that may be of use include a chest x ray and or a ct scan among other things further tests will be ordered depending on the suspected etiology for example if pneumonia is suspected a sputum culture and gram stain may be ordered as well if shock is confirmed the patient must be treated in the intensive care unit icu of a hospital the underlying cause must be treated as the patient is stabilized with oxygen vital signs and fluid intake and outtake should be measure hourly 
query	86	take care of your skin skin care involves more than just cleaning it and using lotion it also involves having a healthy diet getting enough sleep and exercise and managing stress levels your unique skin type may also determine any additional treatments as well such as using exfoliating scrubs or moisturizing masks caring for your specific skin type making additional changes to your routine look for evenness take barely visible pores as a sign of normal skin check for a radiant glow wash with a gentle cleanser twice daily use a toner twice daily after cleansing apply a lightweight antioxidant serum slather on a light moisturizer with spf follow up the serum with a night cream rely on a consistent beauty routine use skincare products designed for in between normal skin have any changes in the skin checked out notice shiny skin see if your skin feels slick take note of breakouts look for large pores cleanse your face often follow up the cleanser with a toner opt for a lightweight moisturizer intended for oily skin exfoliate gently several times a week add primer and powder makeup to your beauty routine get a facial with an extraction once a month minimize the appearance of pores with steam use oil free products target blackheads with a clay mask get rid of pimples with an acne fighting serum look for flaky areas notice if your skin feels tight or itchy take note a dull red complexion use lukewarm water when bathing showering or cleaning your face choose a moisturizing body or face wash with natural oils apply a rich hydrating facial moisturizer after cleansing address chalky skin with an emollient body cream finish off with liquid or cream based makeup run a humidifier to address dryness limit your use of harsh products change out products that dry out your skin see a doctor for especially dry itchy skin look for an oily t zone notice if your skin is dry or normal elsewhere see if you have dandruff wash your skin with a mild cleanser use lightweight gels and liquids apply masks to target oiliness and dryness once a week moisturize with jojoba oil after showering use products with retinol or alpha or beta hydroxy acid for large pores apply acne spot treatments only where necessary wash with a dandruff shampoo notice any redness see if your skin is itchy or feels like it s burning keep track of dryness do a patch test switch to a non drying cleanser use an antioxidant serum daily apply sunscreen every day read product labels carefully to avoid irritation use fragrance free products avoid any known triggers eat lots of fruits and vegetables include healthy fats in your diet avoid skin damaging foods enjoy dark chocolate in moderation stay hydrated apply sunscreen sleep for 7 to 9 hours each night reduce your stress levels get a few hours of exercise each week don t smoke keep your hair out of your face when you re sleeping maintain a clean makeup routine see a dermatologist set realistic healthy expectations choose products that have vitamins for antioxidant protection use products that contain retinoids choose a night cream with hyaluronic acid try a more invasive approach if you re comfortable with it normal skin is picture perfect it typically doesn t get flaky oily or dry patches it s usually balanced and is not too sensitive or easily irritated you won t see too many imperfections with normal skin so you re usually less prone to acne breakouts visible pores typically accompany oily or combination skin and tight pores go with dry skin normal skin usually means your pores are barely visible and don t make your skin feel tight normal skin usually means a radiant complexion while your skin isn t shiny with oil it isn t dull and dehydrated either instead it has a healthy glow without requiring any makeup with normal skin you should cleanse your face once in the morning and once in the evening be sure to choose a cleanser free of damaging sulfates a gel or foaming cleanser is often a good option for normal skin avoid bar soaps which can strip even normal skin of moisture normal skin can benefit from the hydrating properties of a gentle non irritating toner toners can help close up pores and moisturize your skin giving you a healthy glow and a refreshing feel look for a toner with antioxidants such vitamin c vitamin e or green tea stay away from toners that contain alcohol they can dry out normal skin most toners are liquids apply it to a cotton pad or ball and smooth it over your face without rinsing it off if your toner comes in a spray bottle mist it over the face and wait for it to be absorbed before moving on with your skincare routine antioxidants can help protect the skin from environmental stressors calm the skin and give it a more youthful appearance use a lightweight serum to deliver powerful antioxidants without bogging it down some antioxidants to look for in your serum are vitamin c vitamin e resveratrol retinol and or green tea a serum is the best way to deliver antioxidants to your skin because they can actually provide up to 70 active ingredients check the instructions for your serum regarding how often to use it in many cases once a day is sufficient and you should usually use the serum at night you may not want to slather on sunscreen every day but you should wear sun protection daily kill two birds with one stone by applying a moisturizer with built in spf to keep your skin looking its best opt for a moisturizer with a spf 30 for daily use ideally the night cream will be the moisturizing and firming kind and include beneficial stem cells the latter can stimulate the production of collagen and thus increase skin elasticity luckily normal skin typically doesn t have many problems maintaining a skincare routine will keep your skin healthy and glowing and can also prevent visible skin changes that occur due to age such as spots or wrinkles most importantly be sure to always cleanse your face at the end of the day if you wear makeup even normal skin can suffer from clogged pores if you go to bed with heavy foundation powder and concealer on it if you re too tired to wash use makeup removing cloths to quickly cleanse your skin if you sometimes get a dry patch or some oiliness here and there you may not have 100 normal skin if that s the case use beauty products that are aimed for normal dry or normal oily to keep it balanced you should also stay away from abrasive or irritating products including those with alcohol they ll do your skin no good especially if your skin is between two types because normal skin doesn t usually experience many problems it s important to take note of any changes that do occur if you notice discolorations bumps or textural changes in your skin visit a doctor to ensure that they re not serious oily skin typically a shine to it due to the overproduction of oil which may get worse with stress or humidity if that s the case you likely have oily skin as shine is not associated with other skin types an easy way to tell if you have oily skin is to wash your face if your skin gets shiny and greasy within an hour of cleansing you likely have oily skin the increase in hormones during puberty often leads to oily skin so teenagers usually have this skin type if you have oily skin your skin will feel greasy when you touch it you may even have an oily residue on your fingers afterward having to use blotting papers or sheets continually throughout the day can be an indication of oily skin if you have oily skin you re probably used to acne even if you re an adult your hair follicles become clogged with oil and attract bacteria that leads to inflammation which can manifest itself as pimples whiteheads and blackheads oily skin can experience wide spread breakouts all over the face or just suffer acne in the oiliest areas of the face such as the forehead nose and chin because excess oil can clog the pores they typically have an enlarged appearance when you have oily skin if you notice these it s very likely that you have oily skin you will usually notice enlarged pores on the nose and cheeks but you can have them anywhere that there s excess oil on your skin the key to caring for oily skin is to clean it frequently to remove excess oil dirt and bacteria ideally cleanse your face at least twice a day once in the morning once at night you should also wash your face after working out choose a gentle water soluble foam or gel cleanser so you don t strip your skin completely of oil be sure to choose an oil free formula as well avoid cleansers with fragrances because they may irritate your skin and cause breakouts a gentle effective toner can remove any lingering dirt and oil after you wash your face and help diminish the appearance of enlarged pores they can also lightly moisturize the skin so you don t need a separate moisturizer choose an alcohol free toner that contains antioxidants such as green tea or retinol for oily skin most toners are liquids apply it to a cotton pad or ball and smooth it over your face without rinsing it off if your toner comes in a spray bottle mist it over the face and wait for it to be absorbed before moving on with your skincare routine a lightly hydrating product is all oily skin needs if it has salicylic acid which can clean your pores from the inside out all the better apply your moisturizer after cleansing and toning your skin select an oil free moisturizer to ensure that it won t clog your pores a gel based or serum moisturizer is often a good option for oily skinsun protection is important for oily skin so you can use a lightweight moisturizer with spf30 or use a dedicated sunscreen with spf30 because it will deliver some moisture choose a sunscreen with a matte finish though so your skin doesn t look greasy while your pores are here to stay you can help minimize their appearance with regular exfoliation instead of a harsh scrub though use a gentle exfoliator with salicylic acid which can exfoliation the surface of the skin as well as the lining of the pores unlike scrubs which are manual exfoliants salicylic acid is a chemical exfoliant so you usually leave it on the skin to slough off the dead cells for oily skin a liquid salicylic acid product is usually the best method of exfoliation a good oil control foundation primer will keep your makeup looking great and won t dry out your skin powder makeup is absorbent and can soak up any excess oil that remains after you clean your face make sure you re using oil free makeup it won t clog your pores and any acne medication you use will still be effective it s also important to look for makeup products that are non comedogenic which means that they do not clog your pores it s also a good idea to carry blotting papers with you when you re wearing makeup they can soak up excess oil from your skin so you don t have to add another layer of powder which may make you look cakey if this is within your means try to get extraction facials monthly a licensed professional will massage your skin to remove the gunk that s clogging up your pores to leave your skin feeling fresh and clean for a few weeks heat up some water and put your face over it taking care not to burn yourself do this before you cleanse your skin or apply any product so the steam can soften your skin and prep it for any subsequent treatment drape a towel over your head when you re steaming your face that will trap the steam so it s more concentrated on your skin you can also use a steam room or sauna for steaming your face alternatively you can also use low level led light therapy to correct damage made to the surface of your skin including your pores it may take a while for you to see results never pick at your pores it can lead to scars and possible cause an infection you don t want to add more oil to your skin than is necessary so incorporate oil free sunscreens cleansers lotions makeup and hair products in your routine that can help prevent your clogged pores and breakouts when oil and dead skin cells combine they form little dark spots on your skin a clay mask with kaolin a drying mineral can help clean out your pores and absorb oil if used regularly in most cases using a clay mask once a week is sufficient to keep oily skin in check to fight breakouts look for a serum containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid these ingredients will penetrate your pores and target your pimples to help get rid of them quickly don t pop or pick at your pimples you can cause additional inflammation infection and even scarring dry skin often results in flaky or peeling bits of skin if you notice these on your face or in some parts of your body like elbows or knees you likely have dry skin the skin will usually have a rough texture that you can feel when you touch it with dry skin you ll typically notice small pores that make your skin feel tight or rough your skin can often crack if it s dry which can in turn lead to irritation and itchiness dry skin is more likely to feel tight and itchy in cold dry weather dull and red skin are usually indicators of dryness these may get worse depending on the weather how long you shower or the ingredients your skin products include cold winter weather usually makes dry skin more dull and red hot water can be relaxing but it also strips your skin of its natural oils leaving dry skin even more dehydrated and irritated lukewarm water will be comfortable for bathing but still leave your skin with its natural moisture it s also a good idea to bathe less frequently if you have dry skin don t scrub your skin when you re bathing because it may irritate your skin and make the dryness worse for dry skin you want a cleanser that will replenish moisture as it cleans look for a rich moisturizing body or face wash with natural oils that won t strip your skin look for creamy cleansers that contain beneficial natural oils such as argan avocado jojoba almond coconut or olive oil stay away from irritating ingredients such as sulfates or alcohol bar soaps are usually too drying for both dry skin on your face and body immediately after washing your skin apply a thick rich moisturizer while your skin is still damp your skin will be better able absorb and lock in the moisturizing ingredients when it s still wet you can gently pat your face dry with a clean towel after cleansing your face isn t dripping when you apply the moisturizer however don t dry it completely choose a moisturizer that has natural plant oils such as argan avocado or olive as well as antioxidants such as vitamin c or green tea to help soothe your skin look for a moisturizer with at least an spf30 or a separate spf30 sunscreen to apply after your moisturizer to ensure that your skin is protected from sun damage if your skin is sahara dry it s time to break out the heavy moisturizing creams after patting dry creams with heavy emollients mean you won t have to re apply moisturizing lotions every few hours apply your body cream liberally twice a day some emollient ingredients to look for in your body cream include plant oils shea butter mineral oil petrolatum cocoa butter and fatty acids if you wear makeup opt for the kind that will hydrate your skin the last thing you want is makeup that s going to cake or flake during the day you might choose to just wear tinted moisturizer foundation should be liquid or cream avoid powder products which will sit on your dry patches and bring attention to them foundations that are marketed as hydrating or moisturizing are best for dry skin look for makeup that has a dewy or radiant finish that can help perk up dull dry skin it s best to apply foundation to dry skin with a sponge or clean fingers using a brush can actually accentuate flaky areas and make the makeup cling to them very dry air can damage your skin so if your skin is particularly dry a humidifier can help it add moisture to the room you re in so you can run the humidifier during the day and at night as you sleep to replenish any lost moisture a humidifier is especially helpful in cold weather when you have the heating turned on in your home and the air is usually drier perfume antiperspirant and harsh soaps can all dry out your skin try to limit your use of perfume replace harsh soaps with mild cleansers and opt for deodorants without antiperspirant you may think you have naturally dry skin but if you get regular breakouts it s unlikely that you do the products you re using may be the cause of instead stop using them for a couple of weeks to see if there are any improvements for example acne spot treatments are often very drying and may create flaky dehydrated patches certain health problems such as kidney disease or diabetes can cause dry skin for skin that won t respond to moisturizing treatments it s best to see a doctor and rule out any medical causes particularly if you have other risk factors for these conditions even if there is no medical cause for your dry skin your doctor may be able to recommend an effective moisturizer particularly if you have thinner skin your t zone is the area of your forehead extending down your nose to your chin if you have combination skin this area will typically be oily pay attention to any breakouts in these areas they indicate that you have clogged pores in the t zone which is often a sign of combination skin you may have enlarged pores and acne in your t zone as well combination skin means you have a blend of oily dry and normal skin types while your forehead and nose may be oily your cheeks may feel dry or cause you no issues in addition to your cheeks the sides of your face may show signs of dry or normal skin not all people with combination skin have dandruff but it s a common condition if you have a mix of dry and oily skin examine your scalp to see if you notice any white flakes for combination skin a gentle water soluble cleanser is your best bet wash your face twice a day to remove excess oil and soothe any dry flaky patches a lotion or gel based cleanser usually works best for combination skin if you need an extra bit of cleansing in your t zone you can use a soft bristled cleansing brush in those areas don t follow up your cleansing with a moisturizer meant for normal skin instead use a moisturizing lotion with ingredients that are mattifying such as silica and hydrating such glycerin these will target both your oily and dry zones you may prefer to use two different moisturizers use an lightweight oil free formula for the t zone and a richer lotion for the dry spots your t zone will benefit from a clay mask with oil absorbing ingredients and your dry areas will soak up the ingredients in a moisturizing mask if you get both dry patches and breakouts the masks can help keep your skin in line in most cases using each type of mask once a week is enough to maintain healthy skin because the aim with combination skin is to achieve a balance between oiliness and dryness jojoba oil is ideal it is an oil so it hydrated the skin but it is very similar to the natural oil in the skin so it isn t as likely to clog the pores opt for 100 pure jojoba oil for the best results you can use jojoba oil on both your face and body massage it into the skin until it is fully absorbed if you have larger pores than you d like use products with exfoliating ingredients to keep your pores unclogged keep in mind however that no product has actually been proven to shrink pores they just minimize their appearance temporarily if you are experiencing breakouts don t apply your acne treatment product with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide all over your face or it may irritate the dry patches dab the product only on affected areas so you treat the acne without damaging the rest of your complexion some people with combination skin have patches of dry flaky skin on their head target dandruff by using a shampoo designed specifically for the condition use the product according to packaging instructions some dandruff shampoos require daily use while others recommend bi weekly treatment apply light to medium pressure while brushing your fingers across your cheek if your skin turns red then it s likely sensitive you may also notice your skin turn red when you apply cleansers moisturizers serums and other skincare products if you notice that you re flushing and blushing without reason you may have rosacea which is usually sensitive as well bumps and pimples may also be a telltale sign of rosacea so consult your doctor if you re concerned your skin is sensitive if most products you apply cause a burning or stinging sensation you may be using products that are too harsh and are irritating your skin for example you may be washing with a cleanser that s too drying or using too many anti aging products as is the case with dry skin flaky patches on your skin are often a telltale sign of sensitive skin if your skin has a rough uneven texture it can also be a sign of sensitivity you don t want to unnecessarily aggravate your skin so test out any new products on a small inconspicuous area before slathering them on wait 24 hours to determine whether your skin will react negatively to the product the inside of your wrist or elbow as well as behind your ear are good place to test products for a possible reaction your cleanser should not contain ammonium laureth sulfate or sodium lauryl sulfate these ingredients break down the lipids in your skin and allow irritants to get in opt for a gentle water soluble cleanser that is fragrance free if your skin still reacts negatively to washing use your cleanser only once a day use your fingers not a scrubbing mitt to slowly apply the cleanser to your skin use warm rather than very cold or hot water to wash your face extreme temperatures can irritate your skin when moisture escapes your skin it leaves it unprotected and ripe for cracks and flakiness a nutrient rich serum can replenish your skin s damaged protective barrier so it s less likely to be irritated choose a serum that was specifically designed for sensitive skin and has vitamin c to maximize the benefits sensitive skin is especially at risk for inflammation due to uv rays if you experience redness sunscreen can prevent it from getting any worse sensitive skin usually responds best to physical sunscreen rather than chemical sunscreens that means you should avoid ingredients such as avobenzone octinoxate and oxybenzone in favor of natural minerals such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide be sure to use a sunscreen with spf30 or higher it s important to learn what ingredients to avoid when you have sensitive skin check all of your products labels to make sure that you are using a potentially irritating products some ingredients for sensitive skin to avoid include parabens phthalates propylene glycol and sodium lauryl sulfate keep in mind that paraben doesn t always appear by itself it usually is part of a longer ingredient such as methylparaben propylparaben and butylparaben many skincare products use menthol alcohol or fragrances in their ingredients to give them a pleasant scent however these can easily irritate sensitive skin and cause itchy red flare ups so you avoid them it s also a good idea to avoid harsh skin exfoliators such as aluminum oxide crystals or pumice sensitive skin can have many triggers from allergic skin reactions to environmental factors try to avoid these as much as possible and seek treatment if you have a condition that leads to skin sensitivity for example if you have atopic dermatitis or eczema talk to your doctor about a corticosteroid cream or ointment prescription to treat the condition if you notice that your skin gets extra sensitive if you spend the afternoon in the sun try to limit your sun exposure stay in the shade wear protective clothing and slather on natural sunscreen made specifically for sensitive skin not only are they good for your body but they are great for your skin because they re full of vitamins and antioxidants incorporate as many fresh fruit and veggies in your diet as possible apricots blueberries and yellow bell peppers contain antioxidants which can help keep you looking youthful avocados can help hydrate your skin carrots can help brighten your complexionpumpkin and kiwi can help keep your skin soft smooth and supple spinach kale and other dark green leafy vegetables contain antioxidants that help protect your skin from environmental factors tomatoes can help protect your skin against sun damage fats aren t necessarily unhealthy if you eat the right kind monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats can actually help keep your skin healthy and youthful incorporate foods with healthy fats in your diet in moderation olive oil contains monounsaturated fatty acids which are good for you salmon sardines and mackerel contain omega fatty acids which are part of a healthy diet grass fed beef contains omega 6 fatty acids which can help keep your skin taut and youthful if you re a vegetarian or vegan try walnuts instead they also contain healthy fatty acids processed or refined carbohydrates as well as unhealthy trans and saturated fats can be potentially damaging for your skin avoid consuming too much sugar too as it can cause breakouts in acne prone skin chocolate is often thought to be being unhealthy but it actually contains antioxidants which can hydrate soothe and protect the skin stick to 1 ounce 15 gram portions you can get all its benefits without packing on weight chocolate can also help improve skin texture and appearance and prevent acne and premature aging chocolate also has some cardiovascular benefits though the extent of these is still debated for the healthiest option choose dark chocolate if your skin starts to look a little dry and dull it may mean you re not drinking enough water drink at least 8 8 ounce 240 milliliter glasses of water daily to rid your skin of toxins drinking so much water may sound like a hassle but it can leave your skin looking youthful bright and glowing drinking plenty of water may also help reduce acne and keep your skin looking clear being in the sun is good it boosts your vitamin d levels and keeps your bones in tip top shape however the sun s rays can be very harmful choose sunscreen with a minimum spf30 for daily use and reapply every two hours wear sunscreen every day even during the darker colder winter months avoid the sun between 10am and 4pm as this is when its rays are most harmful if you don t like wearing sunscreen consider using a moisturizer or foundation that already has sunscreen in it if you swim or sweat a lot you may need to reapply sunscreen more often avoid tanning beds they contribute to skin cell damage and all too often lead to skin cancer not getting enough sleep can make your skin appear dull and sallow and result in bags or shadows under your eyes getting enough sleep will reduce wrinkles and under eye puffiness and give you a healthy glowing complexion teens need about 9 hours of sleep a night stress can not only wreak havoc on your mind and sleep but your skin as well it can lead to acne breakouts and other skin problems set realistic goals and limits for yourself and leave time each week to do things that you enjoy take a walk around the block to work off your stress the fresh air may also help calm your mind try some breathing exercises they will force your mind to focus on the exercise and help you forget whatever it is that is stressing you out meditate it is an ancient practice that has been around for centuries and for good reason many people find that it helps them clear their minds and relax exercise increases blood flow to your skin and supplies it with oxygen and nutrients the sweat can also help flush out the toxins in your skin so aim to get at least 1 hour of physical activity every day smoking depletes oxygen and nutrient levels in your skin it also damages collagen and elastin which results in wrinkles smoking often leads to premature aging such as fine lines around the mouth hair has natural oils that can wreck havoc on your skin especially if it s very sensitive to prevent damage use a silk or satin pillowcase or hair scarf that will also help prevent creases and wrinkles on your face clean your makeup brushes regularly to prevent the build up and spread of acne causing bacteria avoid going to sleep with the night s makeup still on it will clog your pores and lead to breakouts if you find that you re often too tired to wash your face at the end of the day keep makeup removing wipes in your bedside table so you can quickly remove most of the residue before you go to sleep consulting a doctor who s trained in identifying and treating skin problems is your best bet for pursuing anti aging care if you re worried about wrinkles easy bruising or potentially concerning moles or birthmarks check with a qualified professional rather than jump on the latest fad talk to your doctor about having any bothersome age spots or tags removed aging is natural and there s no clinically proven way to look 15 years younger from one day to the next using sunscreen applying moisturizer regularly and living a healthy lifestyle will get you the farthest beware of health scams you can spend thousands of dollars on face creams and treatments and see no results if it sounds too good to be true it probably is vitamin c prompts the production of collagen vitamin b3 helps with cell regeneration and may improve the elasticity of skin and vitamin e has anti inflammatory properties retinol in particular is made from vitamin a and signals to your skin that it should produce more collagen and elastic fibers it can also reduce the signs of early skin aging including loss of elasticity and wrinkles retinaldehyde and tretinoin are derivatives of vitamin a and can also promote skin healing to see results you ll need to use a retinoid product for a few months some people experience sensitivity and irritation with retinoids start out applying the product every other night to minimize the possible dryness redness and flaking it helps draw water into the skin to plump it up and smooth out wrinkles a moisturizing night cream with hyaluronic acid can help give you a more youthful appearance if you use it regularly chemical peels lasers and dermal fillers won t necessarily put a stop to the aging process but they may offer a temporary solution to your concerns you can also talk to your doctor about hormone replacement therapy though you can t expect an anti aging result speak to your doctor if you re interested in these procedures they re not appropriate for everyone and your dermatologist can advise you whether they re right for you 
query	87	give an acceptance speech giving an acceptance speech can be a daunting task when you re naturally humble especially if you ve been working so hard earning the accolades that you haven t brushed up on your public speaking skills luckily with the right planning and execution an acceptance speech can be an opportunity to shine rather than something that must be suffered through by following a few basic rules of thumb during the writing and polishing stages of your preparation process and knowing basic standards of speech giving etiquette ahead of time you can make your acceptance speech as painless as possible fun even writing a great speech polishing your speech to perfection delivering your speech with dignity don t plan to wing it for any public speaking event planning and preparation is key know your audience start your speech by introducing yourself state a clear defined goal early in your speech explain how the honor you re receiving has personal meaning wrap up with a concise powerful ending be sure to thank anyone who helped you succeed look for inspiration from the greats keep things simple aim to have at least the basic gist of your speech memorized make your speech your own keep any humor short and dignified practice practice practice proofread for technical errors manage your anxiety with stress fighting techniques know what to avoid speak slowly and clearly make eye contact remember that everyone in the room is a human being even if the speech you ve been asked to give is only a minute long preparing and organizing your thoughts beforehand can make the difference between a tepid response and a warm one always devote some time to developing your speech before you step up to the podium don t rely on your natural charisma or your ability to think on your feet once you re staring out at the dozens or hundreds of expectant faces in the audience you may find that your ability to be charming and profound come less naturally to you than you thought like talented authors good speechwriters know to adjust the content of their speech to fit the needs of their audience serious or formal occasions with important guests will require speeches that are similarly formal while more light hearted affairs may call for a less serious tone when in doubt err on the side of formality it s usually less embarrassing to deliver a formal speech at a casual event than vice versa as a general rule the smaller your audience and the more intimately you know its members the more casual your speech may be unless you re sure that everyone in the audience will be perfectly aware of your importance you ll probably want to start your speech with a few brief words about yourself just to give the audience an idea of who you are this will probably involve briefly listing your position some important work you ve done and your connection to the honor or award that you re receiving keep these remarks short and humble your goal isn t to build yourself up or brag but to introduce yourself to people who are unfamiliar with you additionally you may want to be prepared to skip some of your opening remarks if the person who welcomes you to the podium gives you a lengthy introduction for instance if you re accepting an employee of the year award at the tech firm you work for assuming that your audience contains people who don t know you you may want to begin with an introduction along these lines hello thank you for honoring me this evening as you ve just heard my name is jane smith i joined this company in 2009 and since then i ve worked with the marketing content and analytics departments in varying capacities earlier this year i had the honor of collaborating with my boss john q public on a new data processing system which is why we re here today all speeches should have some sort of purpose or point otherwise why would anyone bother listening after you ve introduced yourself don t waste time moving to the meat of your speech try to tell the audience why they should listen and what you hope for them to take away from your speech fairly early on to give them a sense of direction and prepare them for what you have to say since you re presumably accepting some sort of award or honor a good theme to center your speech around is gratitude centering at least part of your speech around thanking those who helped you get to where you are makes you appear humble and deserving of the praise you re receiving rather than haughty or conceited in addition to this you may also want to consider offering advice to your audience or giving some sort of call to action whatever you choose be sure to briefly make your speech s purpose clear in the beginning for instance you might want to say i m here today to offer my sincerest gratitude to the dozens of people without whom this experience wouldn t have been possible i d also like to briefly discuss the role that the idea of going the extra mile has played in setting this company apart from the others in the tech field as you offer your thanks and advice to the audience try to explain just how important the honor you re receiving is to you for instance you may want to mention that the honor is important to you because it s a sign you ve earned the respect of the people who are most important in your life doing this proves your sincerity and gives the audience an appreciation of the honor being bestowed it s not just a trophy or a plaque it has a symbolic importance that goes beyond this one good trick is to call attention to the fact that the honor you re receiving while important to you is less meaningful than the continued honor of simply getting to do what you love this sort of acknowledgement makes you look humble passionate and supremely deserving of your honor for instance if you re receiving a lifetime achievement award for your decades of work as a teacher you might want to say something like as much as i appreciate this award and as grateful as i am for it the greatest reward i ve ever been given is the simple opportunity to help generations of kids learn how to think critically about the world around them the ending of a speech is one of the hardest parts to perfect but it s also one of the most important because it s the part everyone will have the easiest time remembering try to give your ending a serious emotional wallop or a rousing call to action you re looking to go out with a bang not a whimper try to use words and imagery that have strong emotional resonance for your last sentence try to end with a witty observation or a powerful statement of truth for instance in the teacher example above we might end like this as we leave here today i d like to ask the members of the audience to take a moment to think about the importance of educating the children of this generation tomorrow s problems demand bright hard working individuals to solve them and the only way we can create these individuals is by acting as a community to support our schools our teachers and the countless people that they depend on for their continued strength this is an absolute must for acceptance speeches somewhere in your speech you need to thank the people who helped you succeed even if in your opinion their help wasn t that essential forgetting to graciously thank the people who contributed to your achievement can potentially lead to hurt feelings and embarrassment for you this is easily avoided by devoting some of your speech to personally thanking as many people who worked with you or supported you as possible preferably near the beginning or end of your speech so that this is well remembered when you re thanking people it s a wise idea to end with something along the lines of and finally i d like to thank everyone else who supported me during my work there are too many people to list but i want to thank you all personally this covers your bases in case you forget anyone who played a minor role in your success if you re having a hard time penning your speech consider turning to famous acceptance speeches for ideas on how and how not to proceed modern history is full of examples of great and terrible acceptance speeches that can be used as inspiration just a few notable examples are listed below as a positive example consider jimmy valvano s phenomenal acceptance speech at the 1993 espy awards just eight weeks before his premature death from cancer the famed college basketball coach delivered an immensely moving speech to an ecstatic standing ovation from the crowd as an example of what not to do consider hilary swank s oscar acceptance speech for boys don t cry in 2000 swank accepted her award gratefully doling out thanks to all of her supporters with the major exception of her husband whom the cameras famously caught crying tears of joy during swank s speech as an oddball example consider joe pesci s oscar acceptance speech after taking the podium at the 1991 oscars for his work in goodfellas pesci said simply it s my privilege thank you pesci was both praised and lampooned for his five word speech unlike written text oral speech can t be re read once you say something it s been said and your speech continues whether your audience understood it or not to minimize the chance for misunderstanding and keep your audience s attention throughout your speech keep your words simple use clear concrete language don t make your sentences or the entire speech any longer than it needs to be to communicate the points you re trying to get across people are much more likely to have a favorable impression of a short simple powerful speech than they are of a long winded complicated and meandering one for long speeches it may be impractical or even impossible to have every word of your speech memorized however even in these cases where having an outline or a copy of the speech handy is a virtual necessity you ll still want to have all of the main points you intend to address in your speech ready in your head before you begin speaking be sure to know what the main points of your speech are what order they come in and any key transitions or examples you use knowing the outline of your speech ahead of time is useful for multiple reasons for instance not only will this prevent certain technical snafus for instance a breeze carrying your speech away from derailing your speech but it can also help you deliver your speech more confidently after all if you know basically what you need to say ahead of time what need is there to worry mediocre speeches are a dime a dozen make your speech memorable by making it something only you could deliver craft your speech into a product of your own personality give your audience opportunities not just to remember the speech itself but also the person giving it one easy way to do this is to include brief memorable personal anecdotes in your speech that are pertinent to the honor you re receiving or the themes you re addressing in your speech include these as you please but don t forget to exercise restraint remember short and simple speeches are blessings to most people in the audience humor has a place in some acceptance speeches a witty remark is a great way to break the ice at the beginning of a speech and a few jokes peppered throughout can help keep the audience s attention however keep the amount and type of humor you use under control don t rely too excessively on constant joking and don t include lewd offensive or controversial jokes unless you re a professional entertainer your audience probably expects a pleasant dignified speech rather than a raunchy joke filled tirade so give it what it wants also don t forget that there may be people in the audience who were in the running for the honor you ended up receiving because of this you won t want to demean the organization that s honoring you or jokingly imply that you were a bad choice maintain respect for yourself the organization honoring you and the audience as you accept your award like writing singing or acting speech giving is an art form the more you do it the better you become though it s impossible to replicate the experience of standing in front of your audience and giving your speech for real before you actually have to do it practicing alone or in front of a smaller audience can help you memorize the main points of your speech and get enough experience delivering it that it becomes familiar to you in addition practice can also help you pin down problems ahead of time for instance if there s part of your speech that your test audience doesn t react as well to as you thought it would you may take this as a sign that it should be removed or edited before the actual speech as you practice time yourself you may be surprised how much longer or shorter your speech is than you thought it would be if you have a hard time limit for your speech use the results of your timed practice to edit your speech as necessary if you re using a written copy of your speech or an outline to keep you on track be sure to edit this aid both for its factual accuracy and for proper conventions of grammar spelling and sentence flow one of the absolute most embarrassing places you can discover an error in your speech is on the podium while you re delivering it so avoid this awkward situation by thoroughly proofreading your first draft at least once or twice before your speech when you re waiting for your turn to speak at the podium calm quiet relaxation will probably be the last thing on your mind however knowing how to calm your nerves ahead of time can make an otherwise stressful speech a relative breeze below are just a few patented techniques to help minimize problems caused by a case of the jitters during your speech rapid heartbeat breathe deeply and slowly concentrate on someone in the room you re comfortable around like a friend or family member start delivering the words of your speech you ll naturally relax once you start talking racing panicked thoughts take deep breaths look out into the audience and see the humor in their blank expressionless faces alternatively imagine that the members of the audience are somehow unimportant or laughable e g that they re all in their underwear etc dry mouth bring a bottle of water with you onstage to drink as you need it consider also chewing gum before but not during your speech mimicking the process of eating can have a calming effect on the emotions in addition it can stimulate saliva production preventing a dry mouth trembling breathe deeply and slowly if necessary try slowly tensing and releasing the muscles in the trembling body part to work out the excess energy from your adrenaline high above all relax you ve prepared so you have no reason to worry about how the speech will turn out worrying will only make it harder to deliver the great speech that you re perfectly capable of giving even people who otherwise have no tics or neuroses sometimes develop strange repetitive behaviors when put under pressure in public the best cure for nearly any sort of tic is to relax with the techniques listed above however in addition making a mental list of common speech giving tics ahead of time can allow you to catch them if you notice them appear while you re delivering your speech below are just a few of the most common problems you ll probably want to avoid hurrying or rushing through your speech mumblingfidgeting or messing with something in your handsswaying from side to side coughing sniffling excessively as noted above one of the most common problems that inexperienced speakers have is that they can tend to rush or mumble through their speech unintentionally the way you speak when you re giving a speech shouldn t be the same way you talk to people you re close to in a casual setting you want to speak slower more clearly and somewhat louder than you normally would this doesn t necessarily mean you have to dwell on every word and take long pauses between your sentences just that you should make an effort to ensure that even the hard of hearing in the audience can understand you when you give an acceptance speech you re addressing the audience so you ll want to look at the audience for most of your speech just as you d look at the person you re addressing if you were talking to only one person it s ok to give the notes or the outline you have with you a quick look to keep your speech on track try to limit this to short glances no longer than a few seconds or so long the rest of the time hold your head high and speak directly to the audience in front of you if you can remember to do so try to gradually move your gaze from side to side as you look at your audience sweeping your eyes back and forth gives the members of the audience the impression that you re addressing them all individually if this sweeping motion is tricky for you try randomly picking individuals in the audience to look at for a few seconds at a time as you talk to someone who s nervous about giving a speech the audience can seem like one big scary imposing entity that must be confronted and appeased in fact the audience is anything but this it s actually made up of many different individuals all of which have their own internal motives and preoccupations just like you some of the people in the audience may be thinking about their own problems or simply daydreaming while you give your speech others may be practically or literally asleep some may not even be intelligent enough to understand your speech on the other hand some may find your speech interesting or important few however are likely to find it as important as you do so don t be scared by your audience thinking of your audience as a collection of real imperfect people rather than as a faceless monolithic crowd is a sure fire way to make it easier to relax

person s quality of life because they lose strength and mobility which can make it difficult to perform basic tasks people with atrophied muscles are also at an increased risk for falling or injuring themselves since the heart is also a muscle that can break down individuals experiencing muscle atrophy face the risk of heart problems muscles can atrophy from disuse or when they are not used regularly at an appreciable level of exertion this disuse causes the muscle tissue to break down shorten in length and waste away this typically occurs as a result of an injury sedentary lifestyle or medical condition that prevents a person from exercising his muscles disuse muscle atrophy can also result from severe malnourishment for example prisoners of war and people suffering from eating disorders such as anorexia may experience muscle loss and the wasting away of muscle tissue people with jobs that require them to be seated for major portions of each work day or people who are not physically active can also experience this type of muscle atrophy severe injuries such as those to the spinal cord or brain may leave someone bedridden and result in atrophied muscles even common injuries such as broken bones or sprains that restrict your ability to move around can also cause disuse muscle atrophy medical conditions that limit a person s ability to exercise or be physically active include rheumatoid arthritis which causes joint inflammation and osteoarthritis which weakens the bones these conditions can make it uncomfortable painful or even impossible to exercise leading to atrophied muscles in many cases of disuse muscle atrophy the loss of muscle tissue can be reversed by increasing physical exercise neurogenic muscle atrophy is caused by a disease or injury to the nerves attached to the muscles it is less common than disuse muscle atrophy but harder to treat because nerve regeneration usually requires more than increased exercise some of the diseases that often lead to neurogenic atrophy include polio a viral disease that can cause paralysis muscular dystrophy a hereditary disease that weakens the muscles amyotrophic lateral sclerosis which is also known as als or lou gehrig s disease attacks the nerve cells that communicate with and control muscles guillain barre syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that causes your body s immune system to attack your

area the symptoms of neurogenic muscle atrophy can be harder for someone without a medical background to recognize but some of the more visible symptoms include a stooped posture a rigid spine and a limited ability to move the neck if you suspect that you are experiencing muscle atrophy it s a good idea to talk with your doctor or a medical professional as soon as possible they will be able to properly diagnose your condition and provide treatment for the underlying causes if the reason for muscle deterioration is an illness your doctor may be able to prescribe medications that will help you maintain your muscle mass or reverse some damage of muscle atrophy anti inflammatory medicines such as corticosteroids are sometimes given to patients with muscle atrophy which helps to reduce inflammation and compression of the affected muscle nerves this can make exercise and daily activities more comfortable to diagnose muscle atrophy doctors often use blood tests x rays ct scans emg scans mri scans and muscle or nerve biopsies they may also measure muscle tone and reflexes a doctor will also be able to talk with you about whether any kinds of exercise can stop the loss of muscle tissues or if you need to undergo surgeries and other kinds of treatments depending on what is causing the muscle atrophy your doctor might recommend you work with a physical therapist nutritionist or a personal trainer who can improve your condition with targeted exercise diet and lifestyle changes even if the doctor did not find that your muscle atrophy is caused by a specific disease it s a good

qualified trainer or physical therapist though you can do some physical activities on your own to reverse muscle atrophy s effects it is always best to have a qualified instructor or trainer to ensure that you are on the right track she will start out by assessing your capabilities and guide you through specific exercises to build muscle in the atrophied areas she can also gauge your progress and adjust the exercise routine as needed since many people with atrophied muscles are beginning exercise again after a long break from physical activity it s important to start slowly remember your body is not as strong as it was prior to atrophy swimming and water exercises are often recommended for patients who are trying to recover from muscle atrophy because this form of exercise can dull muscle pain quickly tone atrophied muscles rebuild muscle memory and relax sore muscles while it s best to work with an expert here are a few basic steps to get you started with water at hip to waist height try walking around the pool for 10 minutes this workout is low risk and helps develop the muscles in the lower part of your body as you progress increase the time interval and the depth of the water you can also use paddles or water barbells for more resistance these tools will help work your core and upper body try a knee lift by positioning your back against the pool wall and placing both feet flat on the bottom of the pool then lift a knee up as if you are marching in place when your knee is at hip height extend it outward keep doing this for ten repetitions before switching to the other leg as you progress try doing additional sets for each leg face the pool wall with your arms resting on the deck of the pool and shoulder width apart use your hands to raise your body up out of the water so you are about halfway out of the pool hold the position for a few seconds and then slowly lower yourself back in the pool for an easier version place your hands on the pool deck so they are shoulder width apart as you bend your elbows lean your chest toward the wall of the pool if you feel proficient doing exercises in the water add some body weight exercises while on dry land a beginner can start with eight to twelve repetitions of the exercise moves mentioned below these exercises target the major muscle groups perform this routine three times per week to build up atrophied muscles to perform a squat stand straight and put both hands forward slowly and carefully bend your knees as if sitting in an imaginary chair hold this position for a few seconds before going back to the starting position keep your weight on your heels and do not allow your knees to go past your toes to perform lunges stand up straight with your hands on your hips pull your abdominal muscles in take a large step forward with your right foot keep your back straight while moving forward your heel should be raised while the tip of the toe is pressing against the floor bend both knees at the same time until they both form a 90 degree angle you can check your position at the mirror to know if you are doing it right put your heel down and push upwards to stand return to the starting position and do all of the above with the left leg remember that your body should not be slouching forward to do a triceps dip prepare a strong bench or a secured chair sit on the bench or chair and place your hands shoulder width apart along the edge slowly slide your butt off the seat with your legs extended in front of you straighten your arms to keep tension on the triceps bend your elbows carefully while keeping your back close to the bench upon completing this part press down on the bench to straighten your arms for a basic ab crunch lie on your back on a mat or a carpeted surface bend your knees and make sure that your feet are flat on the floor you can cross your arms in front of your chest or place your hands behind your neck or head try to pull your shoulders towards the ceiling by making use of the force from your abdominal muscles hold the crunched position for a few seconds then lie back down and repeat make use of resistance tools such as resistance bands or weight machines to help you with your form you should only move on to these exercises once you can successfully perform the body weight exercises indicated above it s also a good idea to research specific resistance exercises that target the affected area bench presses can be done with resistance bands lay down on a bench and push forward while gripping the bands like you are lifting barbells start with lighter weight bands if you feel comfortable with the current weight fold it lengthwise to increase the resistance once you feel comfortable you can move on to heavier weight bands in addition to the other exercises described in this article cardio exercise is a good way to build up atrophied muscles try establishing a regular walking or cardio routine start with ten to fifteen minutes of continuous walking per day gradually increase your speed and try to take a 30 minute walk or jog daily after each workout stretch your muscles to increase their range of motion do five to ten minutes of stretching after each workout you can also perform a separate stretching session make sure to perform stretches that target all of the major muscles and hold each stretch for 15 to 30 seconds begin with stretching your back and your upper body next move on to stretches for your neck forearms wrists and triceps do not forget your chest buttocks and groin area before moving to your thighs lastly perform stretches for instep and hamstrings here are some specific stretching exercises for different parts of the body neck stretching incline your head forward then stretch your neck to the left right back and forward do not roll your head from side to side as this practice is dangerous shoulder stretching place your left arm on your chest grab the forearm with the opposite arm pull it until you feel that your shoulder is being stretched push the arm you are stretching in the opposite direction to contract the muscles do the same steps for the right arm triceps stretching start with raising your right arm bend the right elbow and reach down behind your head and between the shoulder blades make use of the left arm to reach and grab the right elbow lastly pull your elbow toward your head wrist stretching simply hold your arm out and slightly pull back your hand with the opposite hand do this repetitively hamstrings stretching start in a cross legged sitting position put one leg out attempt to reach and hold the foot for a few seconds go back to the starting position and do the same thing with the other leg lower back stretch lie down on your back bring one leg up to chest level do the same with the other leg leg stretching lie down on your back and extend both legs in the air grab the back of your thighs and pull the legs toward your face a constant supply of protein is necessary for muscle growth see the basic guidelines below for daily recommended protein intake based on your age and gender adult men should eat about 56 grams of protein per day adult women should eat about 46 grams per day women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should eat at least 71 grams of protein per day teenaged boys should eat about 52 grams a day teenaged girls should eat about 46 grams per day foods rich in protein include turkey breast fish cheese pork loin tofu lean beef beans eggs yogurt dairy products and nuts a nutritionist personal trainer or dietician might suggest something other than the recommended dose based on your condition weight and activity level if you don t eat sufficient carbohydrates to fuel your body it will start breaking down muscles instead this can further aggravate the muscle atrophy in the affected area to build atrophied muscle your carbohydrate intake should be at least 45 to 65 percent of your total calorie intake try to select carbohydrates that are also full of fiber and do not have a lot of added sugars these include fruits and vegetables whole grains plain yogurt and milk these good fats stop the breakdown of muscle by interfering with the inflammatory process foods rich in omega 3 fatty acids include sardines salmon soybeans flax seeds walnuts tofu brussels sprouts cauliflower shrimp and winter squash the recommended dose for omega 3 fatty acids is 1 to 2 grams daily when the body experiences stress it prepares to respond this preparation is known as the fight or flight response in this response many hormone levels shoot up including the stress hormone known as cortisol which can break down muscle tissue during periods of prolonged stress since stress cannot be completely eliminated in our lives take steps to minimize identifying the source of your stress can help you prevent it from occurring you can also try stress control techniques such as meditation or yoga for specific suggestions talk with a therapist counselor or mental health professional about the stressors in your life when we sleep our body builds and repairs muscles so this is an important step to combat muscle atrophy try to get seven to nine hours of sleep per day 
query	89	get more testosterone testosterone is a hormone that is produced in large amounts by males and a little bit in females in the testes and adrenal glands high testosterone levels are associated with sexual performance reproductive function muscle mass hair growth aggressive competitive behaviors and other such manly things testosterone levels tend to peak at the age of 40 and slowly decline from there luckily there are many things you can do to increase testosterone so if you feel like your t levels could use a boost you ve come to the right place eating right getting physical making lifestyle changes alter your eating habits get some nuts eat oysters and other zinc rich foods start the day with oatmeal gobble eggs eat cabbage reduce your sugar intake take vitamin d3 stay away from supplements that aren t backed up by scientific evidence develop an exercise plan and stick to it start lifting weights try high intensity interval training do some cardio allow your body to recover between workouts get enough sleep avoid stress cut back on the booze reduce your caffeine intake indulge in things you enjoy address high blood pressure levels avoid xenoestrogens see your doctor how much testosterone your body produces has a lot to do with diet so it s important to become aware of exactly what you re eating a good testosterone friendly diet includes plenty of healthy fats green leafy vegetables protein and cholesterol it s not all bad low fat diets should be avoided when trying to boost testosterone for example minerals such as zinc and magnesium help to get testosterone production started while a healthy level of cholesterol allows your leydig cells to actually make testosterone in addition veggies such as broccoli cauliflower and cabbage work to lower the levels of estrogen a female hormone in your body thus boosting testosterone levels incorporating a handful or two of walnuts or almonds into your daily diet is a great easy way to increase testosterone levels also try branching out to brazil nuts cashews peanuts and other nuts high in monounsaturated fats as men who regularly consume these fats have higher testosterone levels than men who don t seeds such as sunflower and sesame seeds also provide high levels of monounsaturated fats in addition to protein vitamin e and zinc all of which boost testosterone for the healthiest option go for the unflavored unsalted versions of nuts and seeds zinc is one of the most important minerals your body needs for the production of testosterone in fact increasing your zinc intake can significantly raise testosterone levels in as little as six weeks if you re looking for a quick fix six oysters is all the boost your body needs to produce more testosterone as oysters contain loads of zinc but if shellfish isn t your thing you can also increase your zinc intake by eating protein rich meats and fish along with raw dairy products such as milk and cheese all of which contain high levels of zinc if you re finding it difficult to increase your zinc intake through diet alone especially as a vegan or vegetarian you can help the process along by taking a zinc supplement the recommended intake for adults is no more than 40 mg per day the health benefits of oatmeal are well known it is high in fiber and low in fat but now there is one more reason to start your day with a bowl of oats a 2012 study has shown that oatmeal is linked with increased levels of testosterone the study found evidence that compounds in oats called avenacosides can limit the level of sex hormone binding globulins in the system thus increasing testosterone levels oatmeal has also been shown to improve sexual performance it loaded with l arginine an amino acid that reacts with nitric oxide to relax blood vessels when those blood vessels expand blood flow is increased mightily eggs are basically a testosterone producing superfood their yolks contain high levels of hdl a k a the good type of cholesterol which forms the building blocks of testosterone production in addition eggs are high in protein and loaded with zinc two more testosterone producing essentials don t worry about your arteries eating good cholesterol will not raise your blood cholesterol levels unlike bad cholesterol such as triglycerides so you can eat up to three whole eggs a day without compromising your health cabbage along with other leafy green veg such as spinach and kale can do wonders for your testosterone levels it contains a phytochemical called indole 3 carbinol ic3 which has the dual effect of increasing male hormones while decreasing female ones specifically a study conducted at rockefeller university hospital showed that estrogen levels were reduced by up to 50 in men who took 500 mg of ic3 a week thus making existing testosterone levels much more effective the most effective way to increase your ic3 levels at home is to eat plenty of cabbage so try making cabbage soup cabbage rolls cabbage juice or good old cabbage and potatoes scientists have found that obese men are 2 4 times more likely to have low testosterone than their counterparts so it s important that you attempt to shed any extra pounds in order to increase testosterone the fastest way to do this is to cut as much processed sugar from your diet as possible if you are an avid soda drinker that should be the first thing to go sodas are filled with processed sugars and empty calories which lead to insulin resistance and weight gain just by cutting your daily can of soda from your diet you could be eliminating a ton of calories fructose is a type of sugar found in processed foods and fruit juices it is believed to be one of the major factors behind modern day obesity to decrease your fructose intake cut out processed food and drinks along with refined carbohydrates found in breakfast cereals bagels pretzels waffles etc it s technically a hormone but a really important one at that studies show that people who regularly take d3 supplements actually have higher testosterone levels while they may be in vogue they certainly don t help your little helpers produce more t these are the things you should stay away from vitamin c unless you have diabetes you won t benefit much from taking this supplement to boost your testosterone while it may be beneficial in boosting t in diabetic rats that s about the extent of the scientific evidence you re most likely getting enough vitamin c from your diet zma zma is a supplement blend of zinc magnesium and vitamin b6 recent studies have found that zma has absolutely no effect on the production of testosterone in men unless you know you have deficiencies in any one of these categories steer clear do your research research supplements that claim to help raise testosterone levels if you re unsure be your own advocate and make an informed decision just because it s out there on the internet does not make it true if you re hoping to increase your testosterone levels diet isn t the only thing to consider exercise is an equally important part of increasing testosterone levels which is why you should come up with an effective yet sustainable fitness plan designed to maximize testosterone production specific types of exercise such as weightlifting actually cause the body to produce more testosterone exercising decreases your chances of being overweight and as discussed above being overweight can negatively impact testosterone levels if you re not sure where to begin it may be a good idea to enlist the services of a personal trainer who can develop an exercise plan specifically tailored to your current fitness level along with your desired outcome if you want to boost testosterone you should begin to lift weights as weight lifting is the most effective form of exercise for increasing testosterone production however for best results you will need to lift heavier weights with fewer repetitions and it s probably best to avoid the weight machines altogether stick with free weights and follow the advice below lift large muscle groups studies show that lifting larger muscle groups which require complex compound movements is much more effective for producing testosterone than working just one or two smaller muscles for this reason you should stick with weight exercises such as bench presses squats deadlifts and shoulder presses try to work out with high volume the type of exercises you perform will mean nothing if you don t have enough volume you should be doing at least 3 to 4 sets of each compound exercise using a weight you can only lift 5 times per set the volume of your workout is determined by this formula reps x sets x weight volume however when it comes down to a choice between more repetitions or more sets you should choose more sets every time focus on high intensity push yourself hard in the gym only by pushing yourself to your physical limit will you maximize your testosterone production increase intensity by performing each exercise more slowly and by resting for no longer than two minutes between sets high intensity interval training or hiit is another form of exercise which can actively increase testosterone levels in addition to improving fitness and speeding up the metabolism hiit involves performing an exercise in a short intense burst then following it up with an easier recovery exercise this process is then repeated several times throughout the workout this type of exercising can be adapted for most types of exercise you can perform hiit on the treadmill the elliptical in the swimming pool etc just use the following formula perform the high intensity exercise for approximately 30 seconds then follow it up with approximately 90 seconds of slower recovery exercise repeat this 7 more times for best results even 20 minutes of this type of exercise can reap huge rewards so there s no excuse for not finding the time while cardio exercise won t have a huge impact on testosterone production it can still have a positive impact on overall testosterone levels as a result you should try to incorporate some running swimming spinning or other aerobic exercise into your fitness plan cardio is one of the best ways to burn fat so incorporating a little running or swimming into your weekly exercise plan will help you to shed any extra pounds this is good news as being overweight can negatively impact testosterone when you re stressed your body releases a chemical called cortisol which amongst other things inhibits testosterone production cardio exercise is also a great form of stress relief so it can reduce your body s cortisol production thus increasing testosterone however cardio should be practiced in moderation there s no need to become a long distance runner in fact a study conducted by the university of british columbia found that male runners who ran more than 40 miles 64 km per weeks had lower levels of testosterone than short distance runners despite the importance of exercise it is imperative that you give your body the time it needs to recover between workouts otherwise your exercise regime may be having a negative effect on your testosterone levels a study conducted by the university of north carolina found that over training can decrease men s testosterone levels by up to 40 therefore it is very important that you take at least two days off from intense exercise per week and that you avoid working the same muscle groups in two consecutive training sessions on days when you re not exercising intensely just try to be more more active than usual take the stairs instead of the elevator walk or bike to work use a standing desk instead of sitting down all day these small changes help to keep your body moving which is good news for testosterone levels sleep is a very important factor when it comes to testosterone levels this is because your body uses the time you re asleep to produce more testosterone therefore you should do your very best to get at least 7 to 8 hours sleep a night a study conducted at the university of chicago found that men who spent less than 5 hours sleeping for 7 consecutive nights produced 10 to 15 less testosterone compared to when they were fully rested in addition to decreased testosterone production being sleep deprived also increases the amount of cortisol the stress hormone in your system and high levels of cortisol negatively impact testosterone levels not getting enough sleep also interferes with your growth hormones which can prevent you from building muscle when you work out you should also try to improve the quality of your sleep by turning off all computers and electronics an hour before bed avoiding caffeinated drinks late in the evening and having a hot shower before bed many experts believe that stress is one of the major contributing factors in the widespread fall in testosterone levels in modern day men this is because the hormone which causes stress cortisol has been found to have an inverse relationship with testosterone in other words when cortisol levels are high testosterone levels are low and vice versa it is believed that cortisol which puts your body in fight or flight survival mode conflicts with testosterone related behaviors such as aggression competition and mating this is why the two cannot co exist harmoniously in order to maximize testosterone levels it is important to minimize stress in any way you can consider trying deep breathing techniques meditation yoga or visualization alcohol can have a negative impact on your testosterone production binge drinking can negatively affect the endocrine system which in turn prevents the testes from producing testosterone in addition alcohol raises cortisol levels and inhibits growth hormones bad news for testosterone unfortunately beer is the worst type of alcohol when it comes to healthy testosterone this is because the hops used to make beer are full of estrogen the female hormone so you might switch to drinking liquor instead or nothing at all when drinking it s best to cut yourself off after two three drinks as this will limit the damage to your testosterone levels caffeine needs to be taken in moderation otherwise it can produce cortisol which negatively impacts testosterone levels in addition consuming too much caffeine late in the day can disrupt sleeping patterns and less sleep means less testosterone however recent studies have shown that consuming caffeine before a workout can actually boost your performance so if you re really craving a cup of coffee have one before you pump iron luckily increasing your testosterone levels doesn t have to be all work and no play there are several enjoyable things you can do to boost your t watch more sports researchers at the university of utah have found that the testosterone levels of sports fans are linked with their favorite team s performance the testosterone levels of the research subjects increased by up to 20 when their team won but decreased by the same percentage when their team lost therefore you should feel completely justified in watching more sports as long as you re sure your team will win have more sex you probably know that testosterone is what fuels men s sex drive but did you know that it also works the other way around that s right having sex can actually increase your testosterone levels and not only that just the fact of having an erection or getting turned on by an attractive woman is enough to boost testosterone enjoy the great outdoors getting outside and enjoying the sunshine can be hugely beneficial to testosterone in fact exposing yourself to those vitamin d filled rays for just 15 to 20 minutes a day can increase t levels by a whopping 120 if you can sunbathe naked the results are even higher just don t get caught studies have found that men with high blood pressure are 1 8 times likelier to have low testosterone than their counterparts there are specific diets than you can start on such as the dash diet in order to decrease your high blood pressure and improve your testosterone levels other factors such as reducing stress cutting out booze and alcohol and maintaining a healthy weight can all help to reduce blood pressure and if all else fails blood pressure medication can help to keep your hypertension under control see your doctor to figure out the best course of action for you xenoestrogens are chemicals that mimic the effects of estrogen in the body which is bad news for your testosterone levels unfortunately xenoestrogens like other endocrine disruptors have infiltrated almost every part of daily lives and are impossible to avoid completely here are some ways you can limit your exposure avoid heating food in plastic containers if you re heating up leftovers make sure to transfer your food to a plate before popping in the microwave most plastic containers contain phthalates a type of xenoestrogen which can be transferred to your food when the plastic is heated if possible store your food in glass containers instead limit exposure to pesticides and gasoline both of these contain xenoestrogens so try to limit your exposure as much as possible if you come in contact with either wash your hands thoroughly afterwards eat organic produce non organic foods are often sprayed with pesticides and pumped with hormones which mimic the effects of estrogen in the body choose organic product when possible or at least wash fruit and veg thoroughly before eating and avoid meat and dairy products which come from cows that have been treated with hormones use natural grooming products items such as shampoos soaps toothpastes and deodorants can introduce xenoestrogens to the body so consider making the switch to more natural versions of these products if you believe you may be suffering from a condition called low t consult with your doctor your doctor will be able to prescribe medicine that will help your body produce more of its super hormone 
query	90	keep a healthy thyroid the thyroid gland is a small gland that sits in front of the windpipe and that works with pituitary gland to know how much hormone needs to be secreted to keep you healthy the thyroid gland takes iodine found in many foods and iodized salt and converts it to thyroid hormones 1 there are two conditions that can affect the thyroid gland one is hypothyroidism which is when you have an underactive thyroid 2 the second condition is hyperthyroidism which is when you have an overactive thyroid and produce too much thyroid hormone 3 having a healthy thyroid is important and treating conditions of the thyroid is important for it to return to being healthy there are lifestyle changes and medications you can use to get and keep a healthy thyroid making lifestyle changes seeking medical help using medical treatments for thyroid health eat the right vegetables and fruits cut out processed and refined foods avoid alcohol and tobacco products find sources of iodine increase your selenium intake take vitamin a supplements get more aerobic exercise see your doctor learn about thyroid conditions recognize symptoms of hyperthyroidism learn the causes of hyperthyroidism recognize the symptoms of hypothyroidism consider the causes of hypothyroidism get a diagnosis if you think you might have hypothyroidism know the side effects of hypothyroidism take synthetic hormones for hypothyroidism ask about radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism take other medications for hyperthyroidism consider surgery for hyperthyroidism eating fresh vegetables and fruits will help you maintain thyroid and overall health you should also eat vegetables and fruits high in antioxidants such bell pepper cherries tomatoes blueberries and squash however when you are working toward thyroid health you need to know which kind of thyroid issue you suffer from because some vegetables can be more harmful than helpful for example if you suffer from hypothyroidism you should avoid anything in the cabbage family such as kale spinach brussels sprouts broccoli and cabbage these foods interfere with thyroid function if you are taking certain medications for thyroid health you should also avoid soy beans until you talk to your doctor processed and refined foods are not good for thyroid health white breads pastas sugar cookies cakes fast foods and prepackaged foods are all processed and bad for your thyroid health instead make meals with fresh ingredients and use as little premade or processed components as possible try switching out certain prepackaged things for fresh ingredients for example don t eat instant oatmeal in the morning instead use steel cut oatmeal and add nuts and spices to it avoid canned vegetables and make them fresh these small steps will help you cut down on processed foods and help your thyroid health caffeine and alcohol can impact the health of your thyroid if you have hyperthyroidism you should ask your doctor before using caffeinated beverages like soft drinks coffee and tea however you should always ask your doctor before you increase your caffeine intake no matter what kind of thyroid condition you have since you need iodine to combat thyroid problems you need to make sure you get enough of it in your diet iodine is eaten in dietary forms of iodine by eating foods grown in soil with the appropriate iodine content such as mushrooms onions and garlic you can also get iodine naturally by eating meat from organic grass fed animals some animal feed adds in potassium iodate which also adds iodine to the meat you eat table salt is also a source of iodine because it has been supplemented with it you may suffer from a lack of iodine or iodine deficiency when you don t eat enough table salt because this is the primary source of iodine you get on a daily basis this can occur in diets comprised of foods that are not cooked at home the amount of selenium you get through supplementation has an impact on your thyroid health the link between selenium deficiency was only recently established in the 1990 s in relation to graves disease an autoimmune thyroid disease selenium supplementation provided a quicker return to healthy thyroid states than other methods incorporate more foods that contain high selenium levels such as brazil nuts tuna shrimp oysters liver chicken and turkey taking vitamin a as supplements has been found to regulate thyroid metabolism and was associated with decreased thyroid hormone levels in obese and non obese patients studied a dosage of 25 000 iu a day is recommended to maintain healthy thyroid function you can also incorporate more vitamin a into your diet with foods such as sweet potatoes carrots and squash intense aerobic activity has been shown to help with higher levels of circulating thyroid hormones aerobic exercise is any exercise which increases your target heart rate for a period of 30 minutes incorporate more exercises such as jogging running dancing cycling and aerobics you should work out for 30 minutes a day at least five times a week your target heart rate is calculated by subtracting your age from 220 and multiplying by 0 7 for example if you are 35 years old your target heart rate is 220 35 185 then 185x0 7 129 5 if you suspect that you have a thyroid problem then the first thing you should do is see your primary care physician for a physical exam and tests your doctor can easily determine if you have a thyroid problem by interviewing you performing a physical exam and ordering some simple blood tests depending on your symptoms lab tests may include a thyroid stimulating hormone concentration tsh test total thyroxine t4 test total triiodothyronine t3 test an or a free t4 concentration test depending on the results of your bloodwork you may also have to have imaging such as an ultrasound or ct scan there are two common problems that can affect the thyroid the thyroid can be overactive and overproduce the thyroid hormone which is called hyperthyroidism the thyroid can also be underactive and produce insufficient amounts of the thyroid hormone which is called hypothyroidism hypothyroidism is second only to diabetes as the most common endocrine disorder both conditions can cause a goiter which is the enlargement of the thyroid in an effort to increase and manufacture thyroid hormone a goiter presents as a glandular swelling that can be detected as a swelling in the neck it is only considered a symptom not a medical disorder in and of itself hyperthyroidism causes an increase in metabolic activity symptoms of hyperthyroidism include heat intolerancetachycardia or rapid heart rateweight losssweatinggoiters the most common causes of hyperthyroidism are grave s disease a toxic thyroid adenoma a toxic multinodular goiter lymphocytic thyroiditis heart medications such as amiodarone or a primary pituitary disorder a thyroid storm is a rare cause and at the extreme end of the spectrum of hyperthyroidism in this condition the patient exhibits symptoms such as increased heart rate vomiting fever diarrhea dehydration and altered mental status every cell in the body requires thyroid hormones and without them signs of decreased metabolism are present the symptoms of hypothyroidism are weight gaindepressiondry skinmemory impairmentpoor concentrationconstipationhair thinning or lossjoint painsgoiterscold intolerance hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by an autoimmune destruction of the gland or by hashimoto s disease which is a condition where the immune system attacks the thyroid gland hypothyroidism may also be caused by primary glandular insufficiency for unknown reasons iodine deficiency pregnancy congenital disorders or issues with the pituitary gland hypothyroidism can also result from lithium or iodine containing drugs talk to your doctor about getting regular tests to monitor your thyroid if you take any of these types of drugs most often hypothyroidism is diagnosed by simple blood tests such as the tsh test and thyroid hormone test generally once you go to the doctor with the common symptoms of hypothyroidism your doctor will run blood tests to check your hormone levels you may want to ask for a test if you are at higher risk of hypothyroidism doctors may also suggest it themselves if you are an older woman or if you are pregnant or want to become pregnant in hypothyroidism the body has a number of compensatory mechanisms which keep it functioning despite decreased hormone levels in the event of sickness such as infection the body can increase its metabolic rate and the levels may overwhelm the body causing coma a severely low thyroid can even result in a myxedema coma which is an extreme manifestation of hypothyroidism since the only concern with hypothyroidism is hormone productions the only medication used for hypothyroidism is synthetic hormones when the thyroid gland is not producing enough of any hormone it must be supplemented this can be supplemented with a synthetic thyroid hormone such as synthroid in doses ranging from 50 micrograms to 300 micrograms your doctor will use blood tests to determine your specific dose your doctor will start you on a lower dose between 50 to 100 micrograms daily and recheck the blood tests four to six weeks after starting the medication looking for changes in your hormone levels your doctor will also take into account your clinical symptoms such as weight gain energy level fatigue concentration depression or other symptoms of decreased metabolism if your levels are not to the point of hypothyroidism yet your doctor may still prescribe a low dose of synthetic hormone to help level out the symptoms in addition to synthetic hormones your doctor may prescribe armour thyroid which is actual bovine desiccated thyroid gland to help regulate yours starting dose is commonly 60 mg daily and continued until blood tests indicate a response radioactive iodine is used to destroy any active nodules in your thyroid in order to stop their uncontrolled production of the thyroid hormone radioactive iodine therapy involves injection of radionuclide tagged iodine into a vein the iodine is taken up by the thyroid gland which absorbs the radioactive iodine the radiation destroys the cells that comprise these active nodules that are producing excessive thyroid hormone which causes the gland to shrink and symptoms to disappear within three to six months a single dose of this medication is successful in 80 of cases pregnant women should not have this procedure your doctor may prescribe you anti thyroid medications such as methimazole when radioactive iodine is not permitted such as with pregnant women or children these medications prevent your thyroid from producing excess levels of the thyroid hormone and start helping symptoms in six to 12 weeks methimazole is prescribed at 15 to 30 mg per daily treatment of a thyroid storm is treated with beta blockers as well as hydration and sedatives beta blockers are also prescribed if you have increased heart rate as a result of your hyperthyroidism your doctor may suggest surgery with thyroidectomy as the treatment of choice if you did not respond to medication or cannot take the medication if you are pregnant or are a child this procedure is also done in cases for those with large goiters that are unsightly or compressing the trachea this surgery consists of the removal of the gland if you have this surgery you will have to have lifelong treatment to replace your thyroid hormone since you no longer have a gland to produce it another option is a subtotal thyroidectomy a surgeon will remove up to 90 percent of your thyroid gland under general anaesthetic the remaining tissue may still produce enough thyroid hormone to mean replacement treatments are never required or not required for many years you should monitor your general health for signs of change to your hormone health if you have a subtotal thyroidectomy

voiding ask your doctor about potential medications many of the underlying causes of incontinence unfortunately cannot be controlled benign prostatic hypertrophy neurological disorders stroke prostate bladder cancer etc cannot be prevented however you can take steps to minimize your risk of some of these underlying conditions one excellent way to reduce your risk of developing incontinence is to stop smoking the national institutes of health reports that up to 50 of bladder cancer cases are caused by smoking pressure in the bladder caused by tumors results in incontinence if you need help quitting schedule an appointment with your doctor who can help you quit there are prescribed medications to help you and she can also help you find a local support group when you are overweight extra pressure gets placed on your bladder this extra pressure on your bladder can lead to incontinence while losing weight may seem like a daunting task it will be well worth it in the end start exercising more and make an effort to eat healthy foods other ways you can lose weight include making sure that you get the right amount of protein fruits vegetables low fat dairy and healthy carbohydrates each day your daily intake of each food group will depend on your weight age and health if you should be consuming 2 000 calories a day you should eat six to eight servings of grains four to five servings of veggies four to five servings of fruit 3 6 ounces of protein two to three servings of low fat dairy and two to three servings of fats and oils developing an exercise routine and sticking to it your exercise routine should include cardiovascular training like running or swimming weight training like doing push ups or lifting weights and flexibility training like yoga or stretching limiting the portions of each meal you have choosing low calorie snacks like fruits and vegetables research has indicated that men with prostate cancer had 62 75 decreased zinc in malignant prostate cells and that zinc plays a role in the progression of prostate cells to malignancy the recommendation is for zinc supplementation but amounts are not clear at present consult your doctor regarding a healthy amount of zinc supplementation based on the present zinc levels in your diet lycopenes are powerful phytonutrients and antioxidants shown to fight cancer five of the foods highest in lycopenes per cup include guava 8587 uqwatermelon 6889 uqtomatoes 7298 uqpapaya 2651 uqgrapefruit 2611uq some recent findings have suggested that the isoflavones in soy may help prevent prostate cancer you can increase the amount of soy in your diet with edamame soy milk or tofu omega 3 fatty acids are present in a wide array of fish and seafood options including salmon mackerel sardines and bass studies have shown that omega 3 s protect against cancers of the breast colon and prostate drink at least eight glasses of water during the day to prevent conditions such as urinary tract infection constipation and kidney stones that cause incontinence you should also consider drinking most of your fluids during the day and limiting the amount of fluids you drink in the evening before going to bed if you are afraid that you may develop incontinence you can train your bladder to some degree plan particular times during the day to visit the restroom this is a way to train your bladder which helps to avoid incontinence substances that can lead to incontinence include alcohol caffeine acidic foods spicy foods and sugar or artificial sweetener alcohol is a diuretic an agent that causes your body to lose fluid it also irritates the bladder causing incontinence try to limit your alcohol intake to one glass per night if at all caffeine is also a diuretic drink caffeinated beverages early in the day if at all kegel exercises are a great way to prevent incontinence because they strengthen the muscles of your pelvic floor learning how to do them correctly can be a little tricky because you have to isolate your pelvic muscles your pelvic muscles are the muscles you use when you try to stop urinating midstream you will see or feel your testicles rising when you squeeze your pelvic muscles once you ve isolated your pelvic muscles squeeze them and hold for a count of five and then relax for a count of five your goal is to do ten repetitions three times a day a diuretic is a medication that gets rid of extra fluid in the body this is usually prescribed for patients who have heart conditions sadly it also has a tendency to cause incontinence there are several different kinds of diuretics thiazide loop potassium sparing and quinazoline diuretics recognizable diuretic medications include thiazide diuretics clorpres tenoretic thalitone capozide dyazide hyzaar lopressor hct maxzide and prinzide loop diuretics lasix and demadex potassium sparing diuretics aldactazide aldactone dyazide and maxzide quinazoline diuretics zaroxolynalways consult your doctor before taking yourself off a prescribed medication a muscle relaxant is a medication prescribed for certain types of injuries to muscles it may not come as too much of a surprise that the medications that relax your body also cause incontinence recognizable muscle relaxants include valium soma flexeril skelaxin and robaxin sedatives can also cause incontinence an antihypertensive drug is a medication used to lower blood pressure antihypertensive drugs can be a combination of different kinds of diuretics if you are using an antihypertensive drug ask your doctor about other medications available that do not list incontinence as a side effect recognizable antihypertensive drugs include moduretic minizide monopril hct and accuretic overflow incontinence occurs due to an outlet obstruction that then overflows to cause incontinence benign prostatic hypertrophy bph is a leading cause because the enlarged prostate pushes against and pinches off the urethra as it passes through the prostate however other conditions can also cause the symptoms which include increased urinary frequencyurinary hesitancy trouble urinating despite needing to nocturia going to the restroom at night a lot weakened urinary streamrecurrent urinary tract infections utis urinary incontinenceoccasion urinary retention cannot urinate at all while bph is one of the most common causes of overflow incontinence it s not the only cause see your doctor and describe your symptoms in order to help him or her determine the correct diagnosis for your specific condition a tumor in the bladder or prostate can also lead to overflow incontinence so your doctor will likely perform a screening to rule out these possibilities tests will include a prostate specific antigen psa test of your blood a digital rectal exam dte to feel for prostate abnormalities and or a cystoscopy a tube inserted into the bladder via the urethra to check for a tumor if the doctor finds a tumor in any of these instances he or she will like perform a biopsy to determine whether it is benign or malignant during your appointment your doctor will also ask about any medications you take since some of them can lead to overflow incontinence as a side effect diuretics for cardiac problems sedatives and muscle relaxants are common medications that can lead to incontinence issues some antidepressants sleeping pills and high blood pressure medications have also been linked to overflow incontinence since many of these medications are prescriptions to help with much more serious issues than just incontinence never stop taking a prescribed medication unless under the guidance of your doctor though not medications excess consumption of coffee tea alcohol and vitamins b or c can also lead to overflow incontinence your doctor can run a blood panel to test if your diet is too high in b and or c vitamins for mild to moderate bph symptoms there are several prescription medications that are available for symptom control such as alpha blockers such as hytrin which does not actually work to shrink the size of the prostate but will relieve symptoms within a few weeks5 alpha reductase inhibitors such as avodart work to reduce the size of the prostate but may not improve symptoms for up to six monthscialis which although originally marketed for erectile dysfunction ed improves symptoms of bph as wellyour doctor may prescribe a combination of avodart and hytrin to have both advantages this is common safe and effective approach to control overflow incontinence a transurethral resection of the prostate turp is the go to procedure for relieving lower urinary tract outlet obstruction due to enlargement of the prostate blocking of the bladder from emptying this technique uses an endoscope to enter the urethra and clear or ablate the excessive prostate tissue encroaching on the urethra the procedure can use anything from a laser or microwave to needle ablation or photoselective vaporization it is minimally invasive and done as an office procedure in many cases it may require a secondary operation in a decade due to tissue regrowth stress incontinence more often relates to leaking urine than some of the more myriad symptoms associated with overflow incontinence you may notice the leakage when you laugh cough sneeze jog or lift heavy objects increased pressure on the bladder due to obesity or pregnancy is the most common cause of stress incontinence stress incontinence can also occur due to a lack of bladder sphincter pressure as a result of surgical complications surgeries commonly associated with this complication include prostate surgery and transurethral resections of the prostate stress incontinence can results from 10 20 of turp surgeries or higher percentages from prostate cancer surgery your doctor will examine your symptoms and run a variety of tests to determine the best course of action for your case for obese patients this may include testing for metabolic disorders such as underlying thyroid conditions that may have caused the weight gain if your doctor concludes that your weight has placed unnecessary pressure on your bladder he or she will likely suggest that you lose weight as a primary treatment for the condition this will include turning to a healthy well balanced diet in conjunction with a regular exercise routine you can find more information at how to lose weight and how to eat healthy you may want to consult a dietician and a personal trainer to develop the best healthiest plan for you in order to lose weight though known primarily for helping women to improve pelvic floor muscles after pregnancy men can also perform kegels to help with stress incontinence perform by clenching the muscles that control urination you may initially have to practice by cutting off your urinary stream midstream to get a good idea of how the clenches should feel when doing them apart from actually urinating slowly clench while counting to five before using another five count to slowly release perform kegels in sets of ten up to three times per day for morbidly obese patients their physician may recommend lap band or other weight loss surgery options in one study 71 of participants who lost 18 bmi body mass index points as a result of gastric bypass surgery had regained urinary continence by one year after the procedure urination occurs by a complex arc of nerves communicating with the brain and causing muscles within the bladder and surrounding areas to contract and relax if you have a neuromuscular disorder such as multiple sclerosis ms for example you may experience disruptions in these signals resulting in a neurogenic bladder people who have had a stroke can also have a resultant neurogenic bladder if the muscles that cause the bladder muscles to contract and relax are affected most of those who have a neurogenic bladder will already be familiar with the underlying causes however you should still see your doctor for a positive diagnosis you doctor will also provide you with the best overview of treatment options and weigh in on which is likely best for your specific situation also known as timed voiding physical psychological therapy combines will power and exercise to help treat the incontinence this combines kegel exercises outlined in the method on stress incontinence and a voiding diary to help you avoid incontinence episodes before they occur a voiding diary is a daily record of the fluids you ve taken in the times and amounts you urinated and the instances of leakage you can use this record to help determine the best times to stay close to a bathroom as well as times when you should force yourself to go to minimize incontinence episodes though no drugs currently target the bladder sphincter to help with neurogenic bladder some drugs do reduce muscle spasms or induce contractions your doctor will help determine if one of these classes of medications can help with your specific case a variety of difference surgical options are available depending upon the underlying cause for your neurogenic bladder your doctor may discuss electrical stimulatory therapy which involves electrodes and a small stimulator implanted to help deliver the signals disrupted by the damaged nervesan artificial sphincter which is a cuff that attaches to the neck of the bladder and works in coordination with an implanted pump and regulating balloon to collect the urine an overactive bladder oab is a syndrome which leads to an immediate and unstoppable need to urinate common symptoms of the syndrome include urinary urgency primary symptom urgency incontinence not making it to the toilet quickly enough high urinary frequency and nocturia getting up at night to go your doctor will help you officially diagnose oab as the underlying cause only 2 of men who suffer from oab experience regular symptoms of incontinence so your doctor will want to exhaust other potential causes your doctor will likely perform a physical exam as well as ordering urinalysis to test your urine and potentially even a cystoscopy in complicated cases findings also suggest the overactivity of the detrusor muscle which is found in the wall of the bladder treatment involves behavioral therapy with a timed voiding regimen a timed voiding regimen involves going to urinate at set times for example every four hours whether or not you actually feel the need to empty your bladder this is a bladder retraining regimen and a form of cognitive behavior therapy trying to train the bladder to empty at certain times to prevent incontinence a recent report has shown that biofeedback assisted behavioral therapy timed voiding was shown to be superior to pharmacologic therapy with oxybutynin or placebo in patients receiving treatment for detrusor instability biofeedback is when a patient is attached to some electrodes that measure their subjective unconscious physiologic responses that way they can see in plain sight when their body is having a physiologic response such as the urge to urinate and attend to their needs versus a false alarm this ability to see factual data rather than guessing increases their accuracy of judging their bodies cues there are some pharmacologic interventions specifically ditropan which is dosed as 5 mg twice daily or 5 mg extended release tablet once daily combination therapies using combination of behavioral pharmacologic and biofeedback are common 
query	93	study haematology haematology is the branch of biology physiology pathology clinical laboratory internal medicine and pediatrics that is concerned with the study of blood the blood forming organs and blood diseases hematology includes the study of etiology diagnosis treatment prognosis and prevention of blood diseases here are some important aspects to learn about it when you first start studying haematology in medicine steps know the different terminology for physicians specialized in haematology be aware that haematology is a distinct subspecialty of internal medicine separate from but overlapping with the subspecialty of medical oncology learn about the blood diseases that affect the production and functions of blood and its components such as blood cells hemoglobin blood proteins the mechanism of coagulation etc understand how blood is analyzed learn about haematocrit learn which groups of individuals who are at risk for developing anaemia learn about foetal haemoglobin also hemoglobin f or hbf learn about the sickle cell disease hydroxyurea understand genotyping do some history research about the discovery of blood groups understand what is blood made up of understand the different blood groups learn about blood group notation learn how you find out to which blood group someone belongs know what happens when the blood clumps or agglutinates understand blood transfusions and who can receive blood from whom learn about immunohistochemistry learn about the role of cancer learn about breast cancer such physicians are known as haematologists their routine work mainly includes the care and treatment of patients with haematological diseases although some may also work at the haematology laboratory viewing blood films and bone marrow slides under the microscope interpreting various haematological test results in some institutions haematologists also manage the haematology laboratory physicians who work in haematology laboratories and most commonly manage them are pathologists specialized in the diagnosis of haematological diseases referred to as haematopathologists haematologists and haematopathologists generally work in conjunction to formulate a diagnosis and deliver the most appropriate therapy if needed haematologists may specialise further or have special interests for example in bleeding disorders such as haemophilia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpurahaematological malignacies such as lymphoma and leukemia onco haematology haemoglobinopathiesthe science of blood transfusion and the work of a blood bankbone marrow and stem cell transplantation only some blood disorders can be cured haematological analysis involves the determination of different blood parameters which can be done using either the electronic quantification or the manual quantification the electronic quantification can be done with the use of the auto counter and these displace about 15 parameters while the manual quantification of pcv for example is by the use of the micro haematocrit centrifuge this micro haematocrit centrifuge is used to determine the packed cell volume pcv from which many other parameters can be obtained the best way to determine blood parameters is through the electronic device called auto counter because it gives accurate values and manual red blood cell counting is obsolete and inaccurate although the manual quantification is also used to confirm whether the values obtained from the auto counter correlate with it for pcv the haematocrit ht or hct or packed cell volume pcv or erythrocyte volume fraction evf is the proportion of blood volume that is occupied by red blood cells it is normally about 46 for men and 38 for women it is considered an integral part of a person s complete blood count results along with hemoglobin concentration white blood cell count and platelet count the term haematocrit was coined in 1903 its roots stem from the greek words hema blood and krites judge meaning to gauge or judge the blood in mammals haematocrit is independent of body size the pcv of animals can also be determined to know their anaemic state elevated haematocrit in cases of dengue fever a high haematocrit is a danger sign of an increased risk of dengue shock syndrome polycythemia vera pv a myeloproliferative disorder in which the bone marrow produces excessive numbers of red cells is associated with elevated haematocrit chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and other pulmonary conditions associated with hypoxia may elicit an increased production of red blood cells this increase is mediated by the increased levels of erythropoietin by the kidneys in response to hypoxia professional athletes haematocrit levels are measured as part of tests for blood doping or erythropoietin epo use the level of haematocrit in a blood sample is compared with the long term level for that athlete to allow for individual variations in haematocrit level and against an absolute permitted maximum which is based on maximum expected levels within the population and the haematocrit level which causes increased risk of blood clots resulting in strokes or heart attacks if a patient is dehydrated the haematocrit may be elevated repeat testing after adequate hydration therapy will usually result in a more reliable result lowered haematocrit lowered haematocrit can imply significant hemorrhage for example in an ectopic pregnancy the mean corpuscular volume mcv and the red cell distribution width rdw can be quite helpful in evaluating a lower than normal haematocrit because it can help the clinician determine whether blood loss is chronic or acute the mcv is the size of the red cells and the rdw is a relative measure of the variation in size of the red cell population a low haematocrit with a low mcv with a normal rdw suggests a chronic iron deficient erythropoiesis but a high rdw suggests a blood loss that is more acute such as a hemorrhage they include infants who may not have adequate iron intakechildren going through a rapid growth spurt during which the iron available cannot keep up with the demands for a growing red cell masswomen in childbearing years who have an excessive need for iron because of blood loss during menstruationpregnant women in whom the growing fetus creates a high demand for iron patients with chronic kidney disease as their kidneys no longer secrete sufficient levels of the hormone erythropoietin which stimulates red blood cell production by the bone marrow this is the main oxygen transport protein in the fetus during the last seven months of development in the uterus and in the newborn until the neonate newborn child is roughly 6 months old functionally fetal haemoglobin differs most from adult haemoglobin in that it is able to bind oxygen with greater affinity than the adult form giving the developing fetus better access to oxygen from the mother s bloodstream in newborns fetal hemoglobin is nearly completely replaced by adult haemoglobin by approximately the twelfth week of postnatal life in adults fetal haemoglobin production can be reactivated pharmacologically which is useful in the treatment of such diseases as sickle cell disease foetal haemoglobin also hemoglobin f or hbf is the main oxygen transport protein in the fetus during the last seven months of development in the uterus and in the newborn until the neonate newborn child is roughly 6 months old functionally fetal haemoglobin differs most from adult haemoglobin in that it is able to bind oxygen with greater affinity than the adult form giving the developing fetus better access to oxygen from the mother s bloodstream in newborns fetal hemoglobin is nearly completely replaced by adult haemoglobin by approximately the twelfth week of postnatal life in adults fetal haemoglobin production can be reactivated pharmacologically which is useful in the treatment of such diseases as sickle cell disease when fetal haemoglobin production is switched off after birth normal children begin producing adult haemoglobin hba children with sickle cell disease instead begin producing a defective form of haemoglobin called haemoglobin s this variety of haemoglobin aggregates forming filaments that cause red blood cells to change their shape from round to sickle shaped which have a greater tendency to stack on top of one another and crowd blood vessels these invariably lead to so called painful vaso occlusive episodes which are a hallmark of the disease if fetal haemoglobin remains the predominant form of haemoglobin after birth however the number of painful episodes decreases in patients with sickle cell disease hydroxyurea promotes the production of fetal hemoglobin and can be used to treat individuals with sickle cell disease combination therapy with hydroxyurea and recombinant erythropoietin rather than treatment with hydroxyurea alone have been shown to further elevate haemoglobin f levels and to promote the development of hbf containing f cells this refers to the process of determining the genotype of an individual by the use of electrophoresis current methods of doing this include pcr dna sequencing aso probes and hybridization to dna micro arrays or beads the technology is important in clinical research for the investigation of disease associated genes due to current technological limitations almost all genotyping is partial that is only a small fraction of an individual s genotype is determined this experiment actually only determines the phenotype not genotype experiments with blood transfusions the transfer of blood or blood components into a person s blood stream have been carried out for hundreds of years many patients have died and it was not until 1901 when the austrian karl landsteiner discovered human blood groups that blood transfusions became safer mixing blood from two individuals can lead to blood clumping or agglutination the clumped red cells can crack and cause toxic reactions this can have fatal consequences karl landsteiner discovered that blood clumping was an immunological reaction which occurs when the receiver of a blood transfusion has antibodies against the donor blood cells karl landsteiner s work made it possible to determine blood groups and thus paved the way for blood transfusions to be carried out safely for this discovery he was awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1930 an adult human has about 4 6 liters 1 6 us gal of blood circulating in the body among other things blood transports oxygen to various parts of the body blood consists of several types of cells floating around in a fluid called plasma the red blood cells contain hemoglobin a protein that binds oxygen red blood cells transport oxygen to and remove carbon dioxide from the body tissues the white blood cells fight infection the platelets help the blood to clot if you get a wound for example the plasma contains salts and various kinds of proteins the differences in human blood are due to the presence or absence of certain protein molecules called antigens and antibodies the antigens are located on the surface of the red blood cells and the antibodies are in the blood plasma individuals have different types and combinations of these molecules the blood group you belong to depends on what you have inherited from your parents there are more than 20 genetically determined blood group systems known today but the ab0 and rh systems are the most important ones used for blood transfusions not all blood groups are compatible with each other mixing incompatible blood groups leads to blood clumping or agglutination which is dangerous for individuals nobel laureate karl landsteiner was involved in the discovery of both the ab0 and rh blood groups abo blood grouping system according to the ab0 blood group system there are four different kinds of blood groups a b ab or 0 null blood group a if you belong to the blood group a you have a antigens on the surface of your red blood cells and b antibodies in your blood plasma blood group b if you belong to the blood group b you have b antigens on the surface of your red blood cells and a antibodies in your blood plasma blood group ab if you belong to the blood group ab you have both a and b antigens on the surface of your red blood cells and no a or b antibodies at all in your blood plasma blood group 0 if you belong to the blood group 0 null you have neither a or b antigens on the surface of your red blood cells but you have both a and b antibodies in your blood plasma rh factor blood grouping system many people also have a so called rh factor on the red blood cell s surface this is also an antigen and those who have it are called rh those who haven t are called rh a person with rh blood does not have rh antibodies naturally in the blood plasma as one can have a or b antibodies for instance but a person with rh blood can develop rh antibodies in the blood plasma if he or she receives blood from a person with rh blood whose rh antigens can trigger the production of rh antibodies a person with rh blood can receive blood from a person with rh blood without any problems according to above blood grouping systems you can belong to either of following 8 blood groups a rh b rh ab rh 0 rh a rh b rh ab rh 0 rh you mix the blood with three different reagents including either of the three different antibodies a b or rh antibodies then you take a look at what has happened in which mixtures has agglutination occurred the agglutination indicates that the blood has reacted with a certain antibody and therefore is not compatible with blood containing that kind of antibody if the blood does not agglutinate it indicates that the blood does not have the antigens binding the special antibody in the reagent if you know which antigens are in the person s blood it s easy to figure out which blood group he or she belongs to application a person with a blood receives b blood the b antibodies yellow in the a blood attack the foreign red blood cells by binding to them the b antibodies in the a blood bind the antigens in the b blood and agglutination occurs this is dangerous because the agglutinated red blood cells break after a while and their contents leak out and become toxic a person with a blood receives b blood the b antibodies yellow in the a blood attack the foreign red blood cells by binding to them the b antibodies in the a blood bind the antigens in the b blood and agglutination occurs this is dangerous because the agglutinated red blood cells break after a while and their contents leak out and become toxic for a blood transfusion to be successful ab0 and rh blood groups must be compatible between the donor blood and the patient blood if they are not the red blood cells from the donated blood will clump or agglutinate the agglutinated red cells can clog blood vessels and stop the circulation of the blood to various parts of the body the agglutinated red blood cells also crack and its contents leak out in the body the red blood cells contain hemoglobin which becomes toxic when outside the cell this can have fatal consequences for the patient the a antigen and the a antibodies can bind to each other in the same way that the b antigens can bind to the b antibodies this is what would happen if for instance a b blood person receives blood from an a blood person the red blood cells will be linked together like bunches of grapes by the antibodies as mentioned earlier this clumping could lead to death of course you can always give a blood to persons with blood group a b blood to a person with blood group b and so on but in some cases you can receive blood with another type of blood group or donate blood to a person with another kind of blood group the transfusion will work if a person who is going to receive blood has a blood group that doesn t have any antibodies against the donor blood s antigens but if a person who is going to receive blood has antibodies matching the donor blood s antigens the red blood cells in the donated blood will clump this is the localization of antigens or proteins in tissue sections by the use of labeled antibodies as specific reagents through antigen antibody interactions that are visualized by a marker such as fluorescent dye enzyme or colloidal gold there are numerous immunohistochemistry methods that may be used to localize antigens the selection of a suitable method should be based on parameters such as the type of specimen under investigation and the degree of sensitivity required cancer occurs as a result of mutations or abnormal changes in the genes responsible for regulating the growth of cells and keeping them healthy the genes are in each cell s nucleus which acts as the control room of each cell normally the cells in our bodies replace themselves through an orderly process of cell growth healthy new cells take over as old ones die out but over time mutations can turn on certain genes and turn off others in a cell that changed cell gains the ability to keep dividing without control or order producing more cells just like it and forming a tumor a tumor can be benign not dangerous to health or malignant has the potential to be dangerous benign tumors are not considered cancerous their cells are close to normal in appearance they grow slowly and they do not invade nearby tissues or spread to other parts of the body malignant tumors are cancerous left unchecked malignant cells eventually can spread beyond the original tumor to other parts of the body during the immunohistochemical staining of a tissue antigens are usually expressed if the tissue stains positive these antigens can either be breast cancer

query	95	diagnose aortic regurgitation aortic regurgitation is when the aortic valve one of your heart valves becomes weakened and allows some of the blood to flow back into your heart after having been pumped out into the body it can be diagnosed by recognizing signs and symptoms as well as by receiving a series of tests and examinations from your doctor including a likely referral to a cardiologist a heart specialist fortunately if aortic regurgitation becomes severe it can be treated surgically with either a valve repair or a valve replacement depending upon the extent of damage recognizing signs and symptoms receiving diagnostic tests treating aortic regurgitation watch for symptoms that may be indicative of aortic regurgitation aortic regurgitation occurs when the heart valve leading from the left ventricle of your heart to the aorta becomes weakened see your doctor if you believe you may be experiencing aortic regurgitation if you are experiencing the signs and symptoms above it is best to book an appointment with your family doctor sooner rather than later or in certain cases seek emergency care have your doctor check your pulse if you suspect that you may have aortic regurgitation your doctor will look for what is called a bounding pulse measure your blood pressure if you have aortic regurgitation your systolic blood pressure will likely be normal but your diastolic blood pressure the pressure when your heart relaxes will likely be lower than normal have your doctor listen to your heart with a stethoscope if you have aortic regurgitation your doctor will likely be able to pick up a heart murmur when she listens to your heart with a stethoscope obtain an electrocardiogram receive an echocardiogram to evaluate your aortic valve an echocardiogram is a type of ultrasound that specifically looks at your heart opt for an exercise stress test an exercise stress test normally consists of going on a treadmill and gradually increasing the intensity beginning at a slow walk and proceeding to a jog or a run until you are too fatigued to continue or until your heart begins to show signs of stress as per the measuring devices you will be hooked up to ask your doctor for a cardiac mri a cardiac mri is another way for doctors to visualize your heart and to see abnormalities have a chest x ray to evaluate for fluid in the lungs and or an enlarged heart another test that can help in the diagnosis of aortic regurgitation is a chest x ray obtain a referral for cardiac catheterization if the above tests are inconclusive as to the degree of aortic regurgitation you are experiencing your doctor may order a more invasive test called cardiac catheterization opt for watchful waiting and regular echocardiograms if your aortic regurgitation is not too severe your doctor or cardiologist may recommend that you do not opt for any procedures such as surgery but rather that you continue to monitor your aortic valve over time and treat it surgically only if that becomes necessary take medications to prevent worsening of your symptoms if your blood pressure is high your doctor will recommend that you take blood pressure medications to lower it back into the normal range receive surgery to cure aortic regurgitation the one and only definitive cure for aortic regurgitation is to have it treated surgically as a result some of the blood that is pumped out of the heart flows back in after each heartbeat due to incomplete closure of the aortic valve initially you likely will not notice any signs or symptoms of aortic regurgitation it is only once the condition progresses and gets more severe that symptoms become apparent some symptoms to be on the lookout for that may indicate aortic regurgitation include fatigue particularly unusual fatigue with exertionfainting or lightheadednesspalpitations feeling your heart beating in more severe cases shortness of breath chest pain swelling of the feet and ankles if you experience these symptoms this is a medical emergency and you should seek immediate medical attention your doctor will likely refer you to a cardiologist a heart specialist who can proceed with further diagnostic and investigative tests note that sometimes aortic regurgitation presents with no signs or symptoms until you begin to experience the complication of congestive heart failure signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure include swelling of your ankles and feet shortness of breath fatigue and occasionally chest pain depending upon the severity of your congestive heart failure symptoms either proceed straight to the emergency room if you are experiencing severe shortness of breath or chest pain or book an appointment in the next day or so with your family doctor to receive appropriate medical evaluation and treatment a bounding pulse occurs when your systolic blood pressure the force of blood against the artery walls when your heart contracts is significantly higher than your diastolic blood pressure the force of blood against the artery walls when your heart relaxes a bounding pulse is most easily detected at the carotid artery on the left side your doctor will measure your blood pressure in the office and will check to see whether your diastolic blood pressure the bottom number is low if it is low this may be a sign that you have aortic insufficiency and your doctor will proceed with further tests and investigations the heart murmur is due to the backflow of blood from your aorta the blood vessel back into your left ventricle a chamber of your heart due to weakness of the aortic valve it will be a diastolic murmur that your doctor is looking for meaning that the hum of the murmur will be audible as your heart relaxes and when the blood flows back into your heart due to aortic valve weakness your doctor will also order an electrocardiogram ekg or ecg to check the rhythm of your heart look for signs of decreased or lack of blood or oxygen in the heart and exclude other causes of the symptoms electrical information will be transmitted through electrodes stuck to your skin you may be required to stay still and or to walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bike it will be able to evaluate the size and function of your heart as well as illustrating to your doctor the direction of blood flow in the heart and the function of each of the valves if your aortic valve is malfunctioning the echocardiogram will show blood flowing backwards into the heart after each contraction an echocardiogram may be used to officially diagnose aortic regurgitation and provide an indication of the severity of the problem mild moderate severe it may also be used as a tool to monitor aortic regurgitation or other heart disorders so that your doctor knows when further intervention or treatment is needed the purpose of an exercise stress test is to watch how your heart responds under the stress of physical exertion and to draw conclusions based upon that about your overall heart function if you have aortic regurgitation your heart will be less capable than normal at responding to the stress of exertion you will likely fatigue sooner and your heart will begin to show signs of stress due to the inability to pump enough blood fast enough as a result of the backflow of blood into the heart due to a leaky valve by these measures an exercise stress test can aid in the diagnosis of aortic regurgitation abnormalities that may be present in cases of aortic regurgitation include an enlarged left ventricle the biggest chamber of the heart becomes enlarged due to the backflow of blood causing stress on the heart as well as changes to the aortic valve and to the aorta the big blood vessel leaving the heart in more severe cases of aortic regurgitation you may begin to develop an enlarged heart and or fluid in the lungs due to the pressure of having too much blood in the heart at one time these are complications of aortic regurgitation that can be picked up with a chest x ray in this test a tube is inserted through an artery in your arm or leg and passed through that artery until it reaches the heart once it is at the heart dye is injected an x ray machine is then used to visualize the motion of the dye and in cases of aortic regurgitation this can inform your doctor as to the degree and seriousness of your regurgitation allowing your doctor to make the best treatment decisions for you moving forward you will be advised to receive regular echocardiograms to check the status and function of your aortic valve and it is important that you follow through with these appointments as a decline in function of your aortic valve may not be noticeable to you otherwise your doctor may also advise caution with exertion and avoiding strenuous activities so as not to put undue stress on your heart and your aortic valve you will likely be advised to continue with moderate physical activity due to the numerous health benefits that this offers this is because elevated blood pressure is one of the major risk factors for worsening aortic regurgitation if you are experiencing symptoms of congestive heart failure as a result of your aortic regurgitation you may receive ace inhibitors and or diuretics two classes of medications to help with symptom relief and to get rid of excess fluid in your body this can be done either with an aortic valve repair or an aortic valve replacement depending upon the extent of damage to the valve most often for aortic regurgitation a full aortic valve replacement will be required for the surgery you will be put under general anesthetic which means that you will not be conscious for the operation you will receive open heart surgery and your aortic valve will be replaced with a new valve recovery time following surgery usually involves one week in the hospital followed by four to six weeks of rest at home prior to returning to work you may need anticoagulation after the surgery to maintain valve function 
query	96	simplify complex numbers a complex number is a number that combines a real portion with an imaginary portion imaginary is the term used for the square root of a negative number specifically using the notation i 1 displaystyle i sqrt 1 a complex number then is made of a real number and some multiple of i some sample complex numbers are 3 2i 4 i or 18 5i complex numbers as any other numbers can be added subtracted multiplied or divided and then those expressions can be simplified you need to apply special rules to simplify these expressions with complex numbers adding or subtracting complex numbers multiplying complex numbers dividing complex numbers add the real portions together add the imaginary portions together combine the two parts to form the simplified answer remember the f o i l rule apply the foil rule to complex number multiplication combine the terms simplify by combining like terms work through one more example write the division of two complex numbers as a fraction find the conjugate of the denominator multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator return to complex number format recognize that addition and subtraction are really the same process subtraction is nothing more than adding a negative number therefore addition and subtraction are treated as versions of the same process to add two or more complex numbers first just add the real portions of the numbers together for example to simplify the sum of a bi and c di first identify that a and c are the real number portions and add them together symbolically this will be a c using actual numbers instead of variables consider the example of 3 3i 5 2i the real portion of the first number is 3 and the real portion of the second complex number is 5 add these together to get 3 5 8 the real portion of the simplified complex number will be 8 in a separate operation identify the imaginary portions of each complex number and add them together for the algebraic example of a bi plus c di the imaginary portions are b and d adding these together algebraically gives the result b d i using the numerical example of 3 3i 5 2i the imaginary portions of the two complex numbers are 3i and 2i adding these gives the result of 1i which can also be written just as i to find the final simplified version of the sum put the real part and the imaginary part back together the result is the simplified sum of the complex numbers the sum of a bi and c di is written as a c b d i applying the numerical example the sum of 3 3i 5 2i is 8 i looking at a complex number a bi should remind you of binomials from algebra or algebra 2 remember that to multiply binomials you need to multiply each term of the first binomial by each term of the second a shorthand version for doing this is the f o i l rule which stands for first outer inner last for an example of a b c d apply this rule as follows first the f in foil means that you multiply the the first term of the first binomial by the first term of the second binomial for the sample this would be a c outer the o in foil tells you to multiply the outer terms these are the first term of the first binomial and the second term of the second binomial for the sample this would be a d inner the i in foil means to multiply the inner terms these would be the two terms that appear in the middle which are the second term of the first binomial and the first term of the second binomial in the given example the inner terms are b c last the l in foil represents the last terms of each binomial for the sample expression this would be b d finally add all four products together the result for the sample binomial multiplication of a b c d is ac ad bc bd to multiply two complex numbers set them up as the product of two binomials and apply the foil rule for example the product of the two complex numbers 3 2i 5 3i works as follows first the product of the first terms is 3 5 15 outer the product of the outer terms is 3 3i this product is 9i inner the product of the two inner terms is 2i 5 this product is 10i last the product of the last terms is 2i 3i this product is 6i2 recognize that i2 equals 1 so the value of 6i2 is 6 1 which is 6 after applying the foil rule and finding the four independent products combine them together to find the result of the multiplication for the sample 3 2i 5 3i the parts combine to give 15 9i 10i 6 the result of the foil rule multiplication should yield two real number terms and two imaginary number terms simplify the result by combining like terms together for the sample 15 9i 10i 6 you can add the 15 and 6 together and add the 9i and the 10i together the result will be 21 i find the product of the two complex numbers 3 4i 2 5i the steps for this multiplication are 3 2 6 first 3 5i 15i outer 4i 2 8i inner 4i 5i 20i2 20 1 20 lasts 6 15i 8i 20 14 23i combine terms and simplify when you want to divide two complex numbers set up the problem as a fraction for example to find the quotient of 4 3i divided by 2 2i set up the problem as follows 4 3i 2 2i displaystyle frac 4 3i 2 2i the conjugate of a complex number is a useful tool it is simply created by changing the sign in the middle of the complex number thus the conjugate of a bi is a bi the conjugate of 2 3i is 2 3i whenever you multiply by a fraction whose numerator and denominator are identical the value is just 1 this is a useful tool for simplifying complex numbers particularly for division problems thus set up the example 4 3i 2 2i displaystyle frac 4 3i 2 2i as follows 4 3i 2 2i 2 2i 2 2i displaystyle frac 4 3i 2 2i frac 2 2i 2 2i then multiply the numerator and denominator and simplify as follows 4 3i 2 2i 2 2i 2 2i displaystyle frac 4 3i 2 2i frac 2 2i 2 2i 8 8i 6i 6i24 4i 4i 4i2 displaystyle frac 8 8i 6i 6i 2 4 4i 4i 4i 2 8 14i 6 1 4 4 1 displaystyle frac 8 14i 6 1 4 4 1 8 14i 64 4 displaystyle frac 8 14i 6 4 4 2 14i8 displaystyle frac 2 14i 8 notice in the second step above the denominator contains the terms 4i displaystyle 4i and 4i displaystyle 4i these will cancel each other out this will always happen as a result of multiplying by the conjugate the imaginary terms of the denominator should always cancel and disappear recognize that the single denominator applies equally to both portions of the numerator split the numerator apart to create a standard complex number 2 14i8 28 14i8 14 7i4 displaystyle frac 2 14i 8 frac 2 8 frac 14i 8 frac 1 4 frac 7i 4

essential oil and steer clear of ones that contain less or that do not provide a percentage how does the product smell if the product does not smell like you expect it to smell then it might not be a quality product does the packaging include a statement about organic growing practices or wildcrafting if not then the plants used to make the oil may have been mass produced and or sprayed with pesticides so you may want to avoid these products some essential oil producers offer multiple types of the same essential oil these different types or chemotypes feature slight variations in the scent because of the climate soil environment and other factors the benefit of choosing a specific chemotype of an essential oil is that you can customize your dilutions for example basil has two primary chemotypes sweet basil oil and reunion basil oil sweet basil oil has a sweeter aroma while reunion basil oil has more of a woody aroma essential oils degrade more quickly when exposed to light and heat make sure that the product you purchase is packaged in a dark usually brown glass container and that it is well sealed avoid purchasing essential oils that have been opened or that appear to have been exposed to lots of sun or heat some essential oils may make you sick or may even be fatal when ingested so you should not eat or drink any essential oils you can apply the oils to your skin safely but most oils need to be diluted first essential oils can be applied along with a carrier oil diluted in water to use as a spray or mixed with other agents such as bath salts identify the way that you plan to use the essential oil before you decide how to dilute it sweet almond oil apricot kernel oil grapeseed oil jojoba oil and avocado oil all work well as carriers for essential oils these carrier oils do not have a strong smell of their own so they will not overpower or conflict with the essential oils you can also use water as a carrier before you prepare you essential oil solution make sure that you consider how you plan to use it for an essential oil solution that will be applied to a concentrated area of an adult s body prepare a 3 5 solution add 3 5 drops of essential oil for every teaspoon of carrier oil or water that you use this dilution is ideal for applying a small amount of essential oil to your temples or wrists for an essential oil solution that will be applied to a large area of an adult s body prepare a 1 solution add 1 drop of essential oil for every teaspoon of carrier oil or water that you use this dilution is ideal for massage oil mixtures and body sprays if you plan to use essential oil on a baby you should prepare a much weaker solution of 0 25 to prepare a 0 25 solution add one drop of essential oil to every 4 teaspoons of carrier oil or water to use essential oils in the bath add 3 5 drops to your bath salts or to a teaspoon of carrier oil then add the mixture to your bathwater mixing essential oils with a carrier before adding them to the bathwater will help prevent direct contact of the essential oil with your skin which may cause irritation some sources argue that you should never apply essential oils to you skin without diluting it in a carrier oil first because of the risk of sensitization and irritation but there have been some studies that have shown that neat applications can be helpful in some cases for example one study showed that a twice daily neat application of tea tree oil was effective against fungal infections on nails therefore you may want to consult an experienced aromatherapist before

query	98	deal with borderline personality disorder borderline personality disorder bpd is a type of personality disorder defined by the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm 5 as a pattern of instability in personal relationships and self image people with bpd have trouble identifying and regulating their emotions as with other disorders this pattern of behavior must cause significant distress or social impairment and must present certain symptoms to be diagnosed a trained mental health professional must diagnose bpd you cannot do it for yourself or others 1 it can be hard to deal with this disorder for both the person with the disorder and his her loved ones if you or someone you love has borderline personality disorder there are some ways you can learn to deal with it getting help for your bpd dealing with a loved one who has bpd recognizing characteristics of borderline personality disorder bpd seek help from a therapist pay attention to how you feel distinguish between primary and secondary emotions use positive self talk stop and check in with yourself before reacting to others describe your emotions in detail learn self soothing behaviors practice increasing your tolerance of uncertainty or distress practice unpleasant experiences in a safe way get regular exercise keep a set schedule keep your goals realistic understand that your feelings are normal learn about bpd encourage your loved one to seek therapy validate your loved one s feelings be consistent set personal boundaries and assert them respond positively to appropriate behaviors get support for yourself take care of yourself take threats of self harm seriously understand how bpd is diagnosed look for an intense fear of abandonment think about the stability of interpersonal relationships consider the person s self image look for signs of self damaging impulsivity consider whether thoughts or actions of self harm or suicide frequently occur observe the person s moods consider whether the person often seems bored look for frequent displays of anger look for paranoia therapy is commonly the first treatment option for people suffering from bpd although there are several types of therapy that may be used in treating bpd the one with the strongest track record is dialectical behavior therapy or dbt it is partially based on cognitive behavioral therapy cbt principles and was developed by marsha linehan dialectical behavior therapy is a treatment method specifically developed to help people with bpd studies show that it has a consistent success record dbt focuses on teaching people with bpd to regulate their emotions develop frustration tolerance learn mindfulness skills identify and label their emotions and strengthen psychosocial skills to help them interact with other people another common treatment is schema focused therapy this type of treatment combines cbt techniques with techniques from other therapy approaches it focuses on helping people with bpd reorder or restructure their perceptions and experiences to help build a stable self image therapy is commonly conducted in both one on one and group settings this combination allows for the best effectiveness one common problem faced by people suffering from bpd is being unable to recognize identify and label their emotions taking some time to slow down during an emotional experience and think about what you are experiencing can help you learn to regulate your emotions try checking in with yourself several times throughout the day for example you might take a brief break from work to close your eyes and check in with your body and your emotions note whether you feel tense or achy physically think about whether you have been dwelling on a particular thought or feeling for some time taking note of how you feel can help you learn to recognize your emotions and that will help you better regulate them try to be as specific as possible for example rather than thinking i m so angry i just can t stand it try to note where you think the emotion is coming from i m feeling angry because i was late to work because i got stuck in traffic try not to judge your emotions as you think about them for example avoid saying something to yourself like i m feeling angry right now i m such a bad person for feeling that way instead focus just on identifying the feeling without judgment such as i am feeling angry because i am hurt that my friend was late learning to uncover all of the feelings you may experience in a given situation is an important step toward learning emotional regulation it is common for people with bpd to feel overwhelmed by a whirl of emotions take a moment to separate out what you feel first and what else you may be feeling for example if your friend forgot that you were having lunch together today your immediate reaction might be anger this would be the primary emotion that anger could also be accompanied by other feelings for example you might feel hurt that your friend forgot you you might feel fear that this is a sign your friend actually doesn t care about you you might feel shame as though you don t deserve to have friends remember you these are all secondary emotions considering the source of your emotions can help you learn to regulate them one way to learn to handle your reactions to situations in a more healthy way is to challenge negative reactions and habits with positive self talk it can take awhile to feel comfortable or natural doing this but it s helpful research has shown that using positive self talk can help you feel more focused improve your concentration and relieve anxiety remind yourself that you are worthy of love and respect make it a game to find things about yourself that you admire such as competence caring imagination etc remind yourself of these positive things when you find that you are feeling negatively about yourself try reminding yourself that unpleasant situations are temporary limited and happen to everyone at some point for example if your coach criticized your performance at tennis practice remind yourself that this instance does not characterize every practice in the past or future instead of allowing yourself to ruminate on what happened in the past focus on what you can do to improve next time this gives you a sense of control over your actions rather than feeling as though you are being victimized by someone else reframe negative thoughts in positive terms for example if you did not do well on an exam your first thought might be i m such a loser i m worthless and i m going to fail this course this is not helpful and it isn t fair to you either instead think about what you can learn from the experience i didn t do as well as i hoped on this exam i can speak with my professor to see where my weak areas are and study more effectively for the next exam a natural reaction for a person with bpd is often anger or despair for example if a friend did something to upset you your first instinct might be to react with a screaming fit and make threats to the other person instead take some time to check in with yourself and identify your feelings then try to communicate them to the other person in a nonthreatening way for example if your friend was late to meet you for lunch your immediate reaction might be anger you might want to yell at her and ask her why she was so disrespectful to you check in with your emotions what are you feeling what is the primary emotion and are there secondary emotions for example you might feel angry but you might also feel fear because you believe the person was late because she doesn t care about you in a calm voice ask the person why she was late without judging or threatening her use i focused statements for example i am feeling hurt that you were late to our lunch why were you late you will probably find that the reason why your friend was late was something innocuous such as traffic or not being able to find her keys the i statements keep you from sound like you are blaming the other person this will help them feel less defensive and more open reminding yourself to process your emotions and not to jump to conclusions can help you learn to regulate your responses to other people try to associate physical symptoms with the emotional states in which you usually experience them learning to identify your physical feelings as well as your emotional feelings can help you describe and better understand your emotions for example you might feel a sinking in the pit of your stomach in certain situations but you might not know what the feeling is related to the next time you feel that sinking think about what feelings you are experiencing it could be that this sinking feeling is related to nervousness or anxiety once you know that the sinking feeling in your stomach is anxiety you will eventually feel more in control of that feeling rather than feeling as though it controls you learning self soothing behaviors can help keep you calm when you feel in turmoil these are behaviors that you can do to comfort and show kindness to yourself take a hot bath or shower research has shown that physical warmth has a soothing effect on many people listen to soothing music research has shown that listening to certain types of music can help you relax the british academy of sound therapy has put together a playlist of songs that have been scientifically shown to promote feelings of relaxation and soothing try comforting self touch touching yourself in a compassionate calming way can help soothe you and relieve stress by releasing oxytocin try crossing your arms over your chest and giving yourself a gentle squeeze or put your hand over your heart and notice the warmth of your skin the beat of your heart and the rise and fall of your chest as you breathe take a moment to remind yourself that you are beautiful and worthy emotional tolerance is the ability to endure an uncomfortable emotion without reacting to it inappropriately you can practice this skill by becoming familiar with your emotions and gradually exposing yourself to unfamiliar or uncertain situations in a safe environment keep a journal throughout the day that notes whenever you feel uncertain anxious or afraid be sure to note what situation you were in when you felt this way and how you responded to it in the moment rank your uncertainties try to place things that make you anxious or uncomfortable on a scale from 0 10 for example going to a restaurant alone might be a 4 but letting a friend plan a vacation might be a 10 practice tolerating uncertainty start with small safe situations for example you could try ordering a dish you ve never had at a new restaurant you might or might not enjoy the meal but that s not the important thing you will have shown yourself that you are strong enough to handle uncertainty on your own you can gradually work up to bigger situations as you feel safe doing so record your responses when you try something uncertain record what happened what did you do how did you feel during the experience how did you feel afterward what did you do if it did not turn out as you expected do you think you will be able to handle more in the future your therapist can help you learn to endure uncomfortable emotions by giving you exercises to do some things you can do on your own include the following hold an ice cube until you feel the negative emotion pass focus on the physical sensation of the ice cube in your hand notice how it first becomes more intense and then lessens the same is true of emotions visualize an ocean wave imagine it building up until it finally crests and then falls remind yourself that just like waves emotions swell and then recede exercise can help reduce feelings of stress anxiety and depression this is because physical exercise releases endorphins which are natural feel good chemicals produced by your body the national institute of mental health recommends that you get regular physical activity to help reduce these negative feelings research shows that even moderate exercise such as walking or gardening can have these effects because instability is one of the hallmarks of bpd setting a regular schedule for things such as meal times and sleep can be helpful fluctuations in your blood sugar or sleep deprivation can make the symptoms of bpd worse if you have trouble remember to take care of yourself such as forgetting to eat meals or not going to bed at a healthy time ask someone to help remind you dealing with any disorder takes time and practice you won t experience a complete revolution in a few days don t allow yourself to get discouraged remember you can only do your best and your best is good enough remember that your symptoms will improve gradually not overnight friends and family members of those who suffer from bpd often feel overwhelmed divided exhausted or traumatized due to their loved one s behavior depression feelings of grief or isolation and feelings of guilt are also common among people who have a loved one with bpd it can be helpful to know that these feelings are common and aren t because you are a bad or uncaring person although bpd is as real and debilitating as a physical illness the disorder is not your loved one s fault your love one may feel intense shame and guilt about his or her behavior but feel unable to change knowing more about bpd will enable you to give your loved one the best support possible conduct research to learn more about what bpd is and how you can help the national institute of mental health has a wealth of information on bpd there are also many online programs blogs and other resources that can help you understand what it is like to suffer from bpd for example the national education alliance for borderline personality disorder has a list of family guidelines the borderline personality disorder resource center offers videos book recommendations and other advice for loved ones understand however that therapy may take some time to work and some people with bpd do not respond well to therapy try not to approach your loved one from an attitude of judgment for example it is unhelpful to say something like you re worrying me or you re making me weird instead use i statements of care and concern i am concerned about some things i ve seen in your behavior or i love you and want to help you get help a person with bpd is more likely to find help from therapy if s he trusts and gets along with the therapist however the unstable way that people with bpd relate to others can make finding and maintaining a healthy therapeutic relationship difficult consider seeking family therapy some treatments for bpd can include family treatments with the person and his her loved ones even if you don t understand why your loved one feels the way s he does try to offer support and compassion for example you can say things such as it sounds like that is very hard for you or i can see why that would be upsetting remember you don t have to agree with your loved one to show him her that you are listening and compassionate try making eye contact as you listen and using phrases such as mm hmm or yes as the other person is speaking because people who suffer from bpd are often wildly inconsistent it s important for you to be consistent and reliable as an anchor if you have told your loved one that you will be home at 5 try to do so however you should not respond to threats demands or manipulations make sure your actions are consistent with your own needs and values this also means that you maintain healthy boundaries for example you may tell your loved one that if s he screams at you you will leave the room this is fair if your loved one does start screaming make sure to follow through on what you have promised to do it s important to decide on a plan of action for what to do if your loved one begins to behave destructively or threatens to self harm you may find it helpful to work on this plan with your loved one possibly in conjunction with his her therapist whatever you decide in this plan follow through people with bpd can be difficult to live with because they often cannot regulate their emotions effectively they may try to manipulate their loved ones to meet their own needs they may not even be aware of others personal boundaries and are often unskilled at setting them or understanding them setting your own personal boundaries based on your own needs and level of comfort can help keep you safe and calm as you interact with your loved one for example you may tell your loved one that you will not answer phone calls after 10 pm because you need adequate sleep if your loved one calls you after that time it s important to enforce your boundary and not answer if you do answer remind your loved one of the boundary while validating his her emotions i care about you and i know you re having a hard time but it is 11 30 and i ve requested that you not call me after 10pm this is important to me you can call me tomorrow at 4 30 i m going to get off the phone now goodbye if your loved one accuses you of not caring because you do not answer these calls remind him her that you set this boundary offer an appropriate time when s he could call you instead you will often have to assert your boundaries many times before your loved one understands that these boundaries are genuine you should expect your loved one to respond to these assertions of your own needs with anger bitterness or other intense reactions do not respond to these reactions or get angry yourself continue to reinforce and assert your boundaries remember that saying no is not a sign of being a bad or uncaring person you must take care of your own physical and emotional health to properly care for your loved one it s very important to reinforce appropriate behaviors with positive reactions and praise this can encourage your loved one to believe s he can handle her emotions it can also encourage him her to keep going for example if your loved one begins to yell at you and then stops to think say thank you acknowledge that you know it took effort for her him to stop the harmful action and that you appreciate it caring for and supporting a loved one with bpd can be emotionally draining it s important to provide yourself with sources of self care and support as you navigate the balance between being emotionally supportive and setting personal boundaries the national alliance on mental illness nami and the national education alliance for borderline personality disorder nea bpd offer resources to help you find support near you you may also find it helpful to see your own therapist or counselor s he can help you process your emotions and learn healthy coping skills nami offers family education programs called family to family where families can receive support from other families who are dealing with similar issues this program is free family therapy may also be helpful dbt fst family skills training can help teach family members how to understand and deal with their loved one s experience a therapist offers support and training in specific skills to help you support your loved one family connections therapy focuses on the needs of family members separately it focuses on helping family members strengthen their skills develop coping strategies and learn resources that help promote a healthy balance between their own needs and the needs of their loved one with bpd it can be easy to get so involved in caring for your loved one that you forget to care for yourself it s important to stay healthy and well rested if you are sleep deprived anxious or not caring for yourself you may be more likely to respond to your loved one with irritation or anger get exercise exercise relieves feelings of stress and anxiety it also promotes feelings of well being and is a healthy coping technique eat well eat at regular mealtimes eat a well balanced diet that incorporates protein complex carbohydrates and fruits and vegetables avoid junk food and limit caffeine and alcohol get enough sleep try to go to bed and get up at the same time each day even on weekends don t do other activities in bed such as computer work or watching tv avoid caffeine before bedtime relax try meditation yoga or other relaxing activities such as bubble baths or nature walks having a loved one with bpd can be stressful so it s important to take time to care for yourself even if you have heard your loved one threaten suicide or self harm before it is important to always take these threats seriously 60 70 of people with bpd will attempt suicide at least once

and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation identity disturbance impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self damaging recurrent suicidal behavior gestures or threats or self mutilating behavior affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood chronic feelings of emptiness inappropriate intense anger or difficulty controlling anger transient stress related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms remember that you cannot diagnose yourself or others with bpd the information provided in this section is only to help you determine whether you or a loved one may have bpd a person with bpd will experience intense fear and or anger if faced with the prospect of being separated from a loved one s he may display impulsive behavior such as self mutilation or threatening suicide this reactivity may happen even if the separation is unavoidable already planned for or time limited e g the other person is going to work people with bpd generally have very strong fears about being alone and they have a chronic need for help from others they may panic or fly into a rage if the other person leaves even briefly or is late a person with bpd usually does not have stable relationships with anyone for a significant period of time people with bpd do not tend to be able to accept gray areas in others or often themselves their views of their relationships are characterized by all or nothing thinking where the other person is either perfect or evil people with bpd often go through friendships and romantic partnerships very quickly people with bpd often idealize the people in their relationships or put them on a pedestal however if the other person displays any fault or makes a mistake or even seems to the person with bpd will often immediately devalue that person a person with bpd will usually not accept responsibility for problems in his her relationships s he may say that the other person did not care enough or did not contribute enough to the relationship other people may perceive the person with bpd as having shallow emotions or interactions with others people with bpd usually do not have a stable self concept for people without such personality disorders their sense of personal identity is fairly consistent they have a general sense of who they are what they value and how others think of them that does not wildly fluctuate people with bpd do not experience themselves this way a person with bpd usually experiences a disturbed or unstable self image that fluctuates depending on their situation and who they are interacting with people with bpd may base their opinion of themselves on what they believe others think of them for example if a loved one is late to a date the person with bpd may take this as a sign that s he is a bad person and not worthy of being loved people with bpd may have very fluid goals or values that shift dramatically this extends to their treatment of others a person with bpd may be very kind one moment and vicious the next even to the same person people with bpd may experience intense feelings of self loathing or worthlessness even if others assure them of the contrary people with bpd may experience fluctuating sexual attraction people with bpd are significantly more likely to report changing the gender of their preferred partners more than once people with bpd usually define their self concepts in a way that deviates from their own culture s norms it s important to remember to take cultural norms into consideration when considering what counts as normal or stable self concept many people are impulsive sometimes but a person with bpd will engage in risky and impulsive behavior regularly this behavior usually presents serious threats to his her overall well being safety or health this behavior may be on its own or may be in reaction to an event or experience in the person s life common examples of risky behavior include risky sexual behaviorreckless or intoxicated drivingsubstance abusebinge eating and other eating disordersreckless spendinguncontrolled gambling self mutilation and threats of self harm including suicide are common among people with bpd these actions may occur on their own or may occur as a reaction to real or perceived abandonment examples of self mutilation include cutting burning scratching or picking of the skin suicidal gestures or threats might include actions such as grabbing a bottle of pills and threatening to take them all suicidal threats or

completely unable to change their behavior 60 70 of people diagnosed with bpd will attempt suicide at some point in their lives people with bpd suffer from affective instability or wildly unstable moods or mood swings these moods may frequently shift and are often far more intense than what would be considered a stable reaction for example a person with bpd might be happy at one moment and burst into tears or a fit of rage the next these mood swings may last only a matter of minutes or hours despair anxiety and irritability are very common amongst people with bpd and may be triggered by events or actions that people without such a disorder would consider insignificant for example if the person s therapist tells him her that their hour of therapy is almost over the person with bpd might react with a feeling of intense despair and abandonment people with bpd often express feeling as though they are empty or extremely bored much of their risky and impulsive behavior may be a reaction to these feelings according to the dsm 5 a person with bpd may constantly seek new sources of stimulation and excitement in some cases this can extend to feelings about others as well a person with bpd may become bored with his her friendships or romantic relationships very quickly and seek the excitement of a new person a person with bpd may even experience feeling as though s he does not exist or worry that s he is not in the same world as others a person with bpd will display anger more often and more intensely than is considered appropriate in his her culture s he usually will have difficulty controlling this anger this behavior is often a reaction to the perception that a friend or family member is being uncaring or neglectful anger may present itself in the form of sarcasm severe bitterness verbal outbursts or temper tantrums anger may be the person s default reaction even in situations where other emotions might seem more appropriate or logical to others for example a person who wins a sporting event might focus angrily on his her competitor s behavior rather than enjoying the win this anger may escalate into physical violence or fights a person with bpd may have transient paranoid thoughts these are induced by stress and do not generally last very long but they may recur frequently this paranoia is often related to other people s intentions or behaviors for example a person who is told s he has a medical condition may become paranoid that the doctor is colluding with someone to trick her him dissociation is another common tendency amongst people with bpd a person with bpd experiencing dissociative thoughts may say s he feels as though her his environment is not real

query	100	comply with the sarbanes oxley act passed as a federal response to the infamous corporate scandals of the early 2000s such as enron and worldcom the sarbanes oxley act sox represents an effort to regulate the corporate finance of publicly traded companies so that otherwise reluctant investors would regain the confidence to invest it sets forth various corporate responsibilities and mandates criminal and civil penalties for failure to comply with those responsibilities while its myriad provisions cover a wide array of issues sox s provisions as they relate to your company can largely be classified as achieving two aims 1 ensuring corporate responsibility and 2 promoting investor confidence ensuring corporate responsibility promoting investor confidence establish an independent audit committee to oversee audits change the lead and reviewing audit partners every five years get ceo and cfo signatures on annual and quarterly financial statements establish internal procedures and controls to ensure sox related compliance have all members of your company adhere to blackout periods for stock trading treat your financial records with care hire a consultant or designate an internal employee to stay up to date on sox related rules and standards disclose all financial transactions and relationships develop a code of ethics for your company s senior financial officers develop a system by which employees can submit any information pertaining to internal fraud inform your employees they will be protected if they engage in whistleblowing disclose any significant changes to your company s finances or operations sox requires the boards of publicly traded companies i e those listed on u s stock exchanges to establish an independent committee that will be responsible for overseeing the external auditors tasked with making sure your company s finances are in order this group of individuals will be in charge of hiring the company s auditor establishing the procedures that the auditor will abide by determining compensation for the auditor and ensuring that the auditor they hire will perform his or her job effectively the audit committee members by law may not have any other relationship with the company and may not receive compensation for any other services performed for the company it will be helpful if at least one of these members has experience or education relating to general accounting procedures financial reporting and the auditing process as a whole who can serve as a resource to the committee while it carries out its duties regardless you must disclose whether or not your committee includes such an expert sox requires that the individuals with the most influence over the auditing process be regularly cycled out for fresh individuals this reduces the likelihood that any improper relationships develop that would compromise the integrity of the auditing process it is important to have both your company s chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo attest to and sign your company s annual and quarterly financial statements sox requires these individuals to be ultimately responsible for these reports and you must therefore ensure that these individuals are provided with the necessary information regarding your company s financials so that they can fulfill this requirement adequately they will have to certify that they have reviewed the financial report the information contained therein is accurate and fairly presented such information is free from mistakes misleading statements and omissions of relevant facts your ceo and cfo are responsible for the internal accounting controls they are required to report any deficiencies in internal accounting controls or any fraud involving the management of the audit committee any material changes to internal accounting controls must be reported by the ceo and cfo of course this step is vital to running any successful business but it is even more important when those executives may be personally subject to consequences for failing to understand and sign off on these issues employees cannot sell their stock purchased through the company s 401k program during the blackout period such a blackout period usually occurs during administrative changes in the plan and lasts for several business days any attempt to destroy alter omit or falsify relevant financial information or records that would thwart a federal investigation or other relevant government proceeding is prohibited under sox any new audit information prepared for your company must be kept for at least five years you may be imprisoned for up to 20 years and have to pay fines for altering destroying concealing or falsifying records or documents with the intent to influence a federal investigation or bankruptcy case these are issued by the public company accounting oversight board pcaob the pcaob a private sector nonprofit corporation created by sox to oversee audits of publicly traded companies sets forth requirements with which companies must comply this employee should also monitor regulations issued by the securities and exchange commission which oversees the pcaob and sometimes promulgates its interpretations of pcaob rules in addition to the financial dealings included in your company s balance sheet any financial information that is off your company s balance sheet that could potentially affect your company s finances must be disclosed under sox as one of sox s primary goals is to increase investor confidence and prevent corporate fraud any information that affects your company s financial situation in a meaningful way should be disclosed if you are in doubt it is always best to disclose so that your compliance with sox or motives are not called into question sox prohibits a company from providing personal loans to its directors or executive officers this rule also extends to subsidiary companies while sox does not explicitly require you to create such standards for your high level executives it does require you to disclose whether or not your company has this type of code in place having a robust system in place to govern the actions of the senior members of your company is a great way to promote transparency and demonstrate the your company is doing its best to comply with sox s objectives any changes or waivers of the code must also be disclosed as they arise this should be done by your independent auditing committee to preserve the integrity of this important process and should be completely confidential while you obviously will be doing your best to comply with the provisions of sox many companies are large in size and scope and things can happen without management s knowledge having such a system in place will help your company remain on the level by allowing a certain degree of self policing as employees will feel they can do the right thing anonymously without fear of reprisal make sure this system is truly confidential as any adverse action taken against an employee for this type of whistleblowing activity or for aiding in a federal investigation is strictly prohibited under sox whistleblowers are people who alert the company when there has been a breach of internal policy and or government regulations a whistleblower cannot be fired as a result of whistleblowing demoting denying overtime benefits or promotion to disciplining failing to hire or rehire intimidating unfavorably reassigning or reducing pay or hours for such an employee is also prohibited under sox if your employees are assured they do not have to fear reprisal for reporting instances of fraud they will be more likely to do so this will help your company deal with problems quickly and privately preserving your company s reputation and compliance with sox make sure that your company has a reporting and investigation process in place for instances of whistleblowing these changes must be disclosed rapidly after they arise in a manner a layperson could understand as sox concerns itself with investor confidence this helps your investors keep abreast of changes to your company s financial status in more or less real time legal insider trading involving the company s directors or officers must be reported within two business days

others do not depending on your style and what you re looking for in a hat you ll need to make some decisions if you live in a warm climate you might want to shy away from getting a wool fedora so you don t overheat for warmer climates consider getting a felt or straw fedora if you re more of a traditionalist consider getting a classic fedora a classic fedora is generally made of wool and will make you look just like the gangsters in old movies if you have a smaller head consider getting a pork pie hat this type of fedora has a smaller brim so it will fit your face better a wool fedora looks great with a suit and tie wearing a fedora is stylish way to look original and classy at a fancy event if you don t currently have a suit you can buy one in most department stores or at a thrift store

made of straw those are considered warmer weather fedoras and your hat will look odd with your outfit since the fedora is a dressy hat you ll need to dress up your outfit a little bit if you re going with jeans do this by pairing your jeans which should be well tailored with a blazer or nice jacket try adding a colorful or patterned button down shirt under your jacket for a little pop of color and

this tilt the brim so the hat is positioned over your eyebrows if the brim tips down over your eyes when you move the hat is too big neutrals like black and camel are popular but to give yourself a fun whimsical edge try wearing a fedora in a bright color like purple or green you can also look for fedoras in interesting textures like denim or leather if you choose to rock a bright fedora make the fedora your focal point wear something subdued like black or a neutral color on the bottom so you don t distract from your hat pair your colorful fedora with a dark trench for the perfect rainy day outfit sometimes you will find a fedora that you really like but it s missing that something extra if you want to take your fedora to the next level try hot gluing a dramatic feather to the inside of your fedora band if your fedora does not come with a band you can glue a ribbon around the hat if you don t want to commit to an embellishment try tying the ribbon around the hat then you can swap out your ribbon for different colored sashes or bands depending on your outfit the brighter the color of your fedora the fewer embellishments you should add pairing your fedora with a leather jacket will give you a rock and roll edge try wearing a t shirt or flannel shirt under your jacket for a 90 s grunge vibe if you don t have a leather jacket or don t want to buy one for ethical reasons try using a faux leather jacket instead make sure whatever jacket you end up choosing fits you well you want the jacket to be tight but not too tight for a cozy weekend look try rocking your fedora with an oversized cable knit sweater add boyfriend jeans on the bottom and a soft worn in t shirt for a casual comfortable look you can also try substituting the sweater for a flannel shirt or solid hoodie fedoras look great with layers so feel free to start with a tank top add a cardigan and throw a vest over that try wearing your fedora with a dress that has a loud print for optimal fun experiment with mixing prints like a polka dot dress and a striped jacket be careful not to go overboard with the patterns you don t want to distract from your hat try wearing a pair of patterned pants on the bottom with a solid tee on the top the solid will help balance out the patterns and allow your hat to be the star of the show if you choose to wear a fedora don t apologize for wearing it if you aren t confident there s a chance that the hat will wear you if you hold your head up high and exude confidence your classy style will be sure to turn heads don t be surprised if after you start wearing a

motor home consider going to to your bank and asking about financing options by determining how much money you can get before you shop you will know exactly how much you can spend your bank will help you determine the type and amount of loan you can get based on your credit score income and banking history most financing will be through personal unsecured loans personal loans often have low fixed interest rates which act to lower your monthly payment additionally having an unsecured loan means you will not have to put up your motor home as collateral in order to get the money before going anywhere talk to family and friends that have motor homes ask them about their buying experience and how they made their important purchases talking to current and previous owners will help you determine what route you will want to take when you purchase yours if you do not personally know anyone with a motor home find internet chatrooms and online forums where you can talk to other owners find these internet sources by conducting quick searches through google or other search engines try searching for rv chatrooms or motor home online forums motor homes are expensive investments and because of this it can often be advantageous to look for both new and used models while buying a new motor home can be attractive you can usually find good deals on used motor homes if you know where and how to look when buying a new motor home your main concern will be negotiating a fair price however when purchasing a used motor home you must take much more into consideration for example in addition to price you must also research the motor home s history e g who owned it how many miles are on it what condition the motor home is in and if it has ever been in an accident start your search online to get an idea of prices before you talk to anyone in person online searches will also give you the ability to search for sales across the country in places you cannot readily visit in person when you shop online use reputable websites for example try rvt com rvzen com and campingworld com these websites will allow you to search listings by make model price and other criteria when you shop online have someone available to look over the motor home in person be prepared to travel a long distance to pick up your purchase if you cannot travel you might be able to pay someone to transport the motor home to you motor home shows usually take place in huge convention centers and parking lots during the spring summer and fall months during these shows motor home manufacturers will bring a number of models and park them for people to look through these shows offer a great opportunity for you to see all the different styles in one place additionally because the manufacturers will be physically present you will be able to get all of your questions answered by the most knowledgeable individuals different dealers will have different manufacturers and models on hand like car dealerships motor home salespeople will usually greet you immediately to try and make a sale do not get intimidated or pressured into buying something take as much time as you need and visit as many dealerships as you need when buying from dealerships be firm but respectful do your research ahead of time and be prepared to walk away if you do not get a reasonable price tell the salesperson what you are willing to spend on a certain model and stick to it most manufacturers will have websites where you can look through all the models available and customize them to your needs the websites may even discuss the manufacturer s suggested retail price msrp which can help you determine what your motor home might cost while some parts of the motor home will be made by third parties a lot of the doors siding trim pieces and bumpers are made by the manufacturer if the manufacturer is out of business you may not be able to get replacement parts should you ever need them when you test drive the motor home take it on the type of roads you plan on using it on for example if you plan on driving on a lot of dirt roads test drive the motor home on dirt roads if you plan on driving on the highway a lot test drive it on the highway make sure the mirrors are in good working order and make sure your blind spots are manageable if you do not feel comfortable driving the motor home you will not likely use it the weight of a motor home is extremely important as it will dictate the type of license you need what roads it can be driven on where it can be taken and the likely cost of maintaining it when you are test driving the motor home take it somewhere to have it weighed ideally the motor home should be weighed at all four wheels at the very least each axle should be weighed compare the weight of the motor home to the manufacturer s recommendations also consider whether the motor home is empty or full a loaded motor home can add hundreds of pounds and can greatly affect how the motor home operates and performs ask the shop to look the motor home over to make sure everything is in good condition in addition to checking the wheels brakes lights engine and transmission ask to have the chassis looked at as well you want to make sure the chassis year matches the motor home year and you also want to make sure the chassis isn t bent like any vehicle your motor home will have to be serviced on a regular basis to make sure it stays in good condition some motor homes will have higher maintenance costs than others for example motor homes with a lot of electronics and other bells and whistles will usually cost more to service than other motor homes without those features in addition some service stations will not be able to service the motor home you have therefore take the motor home to your local service shop and ask whether the motor home can be serviced there and if so how much routine maintenance is likely to cost start by gathering important financial information which will include how much financing you have been offered by your bank and how much cash you have on hand for a down payment next collect information that will help you negotiate with a salesperson this information will include comparable prices at other dealerships online prices and msrps take this information to the salesperson and make a reasonable offer negotiating the price of a motor home is very similar to being able to negotiate car price in all likelihood the salesperson will try to get the most for the motor home as is possible make sure you have a walking away price that you will not go above if the salesperson is unwilling to part with the motor home for an agreeable price be willing to walk away if a price can be agreed upon shake hands with the salesperson and make the purchase you will have to sign a contract executing the purchase so make sure you understand exactly what you are signing if you have any concerns do not finalize the sale until you have talked to someone about your concerns this might include asking a lawyer for help motor home insurance will usually be offered by the same insurance company that offers car insurance call the company you have other insurance policies with and ask for a motor home quote most motor home policies will help cover collisions fires hail animals vandalism and low branches and overhangs additionally with some additional coverage you might be able to protect your attachments including awnings satellite dishes and tv antennas 
query	105	install ibm java on ubuntu linux in this document i will cover the installation of ibm sdk java technology edition version 7 0 on ubuntu linux this tutorial covers the installation of ibm java 64 bit on ubuntu linux steps this document assumes that you might have another vendor version of java installed on your ubuntu linux system such as openjdk or oracle java which is common when you use ubuntu linux first of all we will remove and disable other vendor versions of java so there is no system conflict with multiple versions of java let s assume you have openjdk installed on your system if so we are going to remove openjdk by issuing the following commands to remove openjdk from your system issue the following command type copy paste sudo apt get purge openjdk this command will completely remove openjdk jre from your system second we will disable oracle java if it is installed by editing the etc profile system path in this exercise we will comment out the references to oracle java in the system wide etc profile file i also recommend deleting the oracle java folders if you have them so they do not cause system conflicts for example if you have oracle java installed in usr local java follow these instructions to remove oracle javatype copy paste cd usr local javatype copy paste rm rf jdk1 7 0type copy paste rm rf jre1 7 0 if oracle java is installed on your system you will comment out the references to oracle java in the etc profile profile or bashrc file for example as root use a text editor such as nano or gedit to edit your etc profile you may have a file that looks like this java home usr local java jdk1 7 0path path home bin java home binjre home usr local java jre1 7 0path path home bin jre home binexport java homeexport jre homeexport path you want to make sure you comment out the references to oracle java using the symbol in your etc profile profile and bashrc file so change the file to look like this java home usr local java jdk1 7 0 path

query	106	make a fully customized live kde cd dvd using kubuntu there are tools available to allow anyone to create and distribute a completely customized ubuntu based distribution using the gnome desktop many kubuntu users would like to do the same thing but such tools are not fully compatible with kde and the kiosk tool does not change or remove all of the kubuntu defaults so that a program like re mastersys can create a customized iso with the defined changes steps install kde kubuntu install ubuntu server normally when you install kubuntu you download one of the kubuntu iso images and make the cd and then install it on the system update the installationsudo apt get updatesudo apt get upgrade y install x server kdm kde core pmount and synaptic obviously we need to install the x server and kde use synaptic to install core softwareadd the following to your sources list file remastersysdeb http www remastersys klikit com repository remastersys we need some software installed to handle key factors like sound automount and many other things remove the server kernelthere is one thing we have to clean up when using this install method and that is the kernel install additional packagesnote you may want to use remastersys to create a core system iso image before installing more packages create a test account to see your default setting changesuse your current account as the working account where we do all the changes editing and configuration changes set default kicker optionsnote if you plan on using kicker kickoff 1 or any other menu system outside of the standard kde menu in your distribution install it now before continuing with the rest of this step select your default cursor theme setting of the default cursor is much easier now setup the desired default desktop iconsto setup default desktop icons the icons every new user will see when they first login simply setup icons on your working desktop use the kiosk admin tool and click on setup profile select desktop icons and click setup desktop icons then click save set the default icon themeto set default icons in kde so that all new first time users start with your selected icon theme right click on the desktop and select run command set default background imagesetting the default background image hand edit the following etc kde profile default share config kdesktoprchere we are concerned with two entries wallpaper wallpapermode in my case the entries look like this wallpaper usr share wallpapers jewell pngwallpapermode scaledkiosk admin tool will also do this but it s a bit more time consuming set the default theme and color schemethe absolute best way to setup and install a color scheme is to use the kiosk admin tool set the default k splash themeyou will have to create the file that sets the default k splash theme set the kdm themeunfortunately the kdmrc file on this setup is bad login manager settingslike kdm this is a global setting so it s a quick and simple one set default soundsyou will have to create the file that sets the default sounds clean up for iso creationonce you have tested and are satisfied with everything then remove and delete the test user account create the iso imageusing remastersys is pretty straightfoward the main issue of trying to get a customized kde kubuntu based distribution is dealing with many of the hidden default settings in kubuntu to begin with ideally it would be much easier to have a base kde install where those defaults are not present fortunately there is a way to do this using the ubuntu repositories however whether you use the live cd or the alternate install cd you are going to end up with the default setting we don t want in order to avoid getting those configuration files installed one needs to do the installation through another method that method is to simply use the ubuntu server edition cd instead the server edition does not install the x server and therefore does not install a gui because of this we can install kde clean and without the messy kubuntu default settings download the ubuntu server edition iso file and create the cd from the image on the selected machine install the ubuntu server when asked what additional services you wish to install do not select any this will install only the core ubuntu components and base files on the system nan however it has to be done correctly or we may as well have used the kubuntu cds since we only have a command line at this point we will have to utilize it login and at the prompt and type the following command exactly as i have it here sudo apt get install x org kdm kde core pmount synaptic yafter the installation completes run the following commandsudo shutdown r now the current installation is extremely minimal and would require a great amount of time to go through and individually find all the correct packages needed so i have used synaptic to create a recovery file of all the software you need for your core install system click reload in synaptic to update the apt sources in synaptic go to file read markings browse to the file basebuild that was included in the archive along with this file click apply since we used the server edition for the base install we have the server kernel as we are either building a desktop system or a demonstration system as is the case with me we certainly don t need the server kernel the core packages file installed the 2 4 26 18 generic kernel packages latest at time of this how to so use synaptic to remove all of the old 2 4 6 xx server kernel packages on your machine use completely remove option to purge them this will allow you to have a clean base install to work from if you want to create different types of kubuntu based distributions at this point i am going to let you play on your own we are going to install the software packages we want to be included on our cd dvd iso image it is completely your choice of what to install you know what you want to have on your live cd dvd there is one important note about what you install though do not install any package that will setup the kubuntu defaults if you do then the rest of this how to will become useless for use as i am basing it on a build that is free of these default settings final word of warning be careful on what you include in your customized distribution especially if you include non open source packages some of these by their license must be installed separately by the end user also note even including some open source packages may prove an issue because of some legal restrictions if you are not sure about some things research ask in a forum ask those who also make distributions etcetera do not land yourself in hot water for illegal distribution of software finally to assist you here is a copy of

srcremastersysthere is a known problem in hardy heron kaffeine is broken and will not function fully it is best to not include it until it is fixed if you have it installed you should purge all kaffeine files from your system or you will have issues this will be updated when kaffeine is fixed you will also need a test account to see how things come together as you do them test often you should test each time you make a change to the default desk configuration and make sure everything is coming together as you planned each time you make a change use krusader or some other file manager in root mode and clean out the entire home folder including the hidden folders especially of your test account when you do that it will repopulate with new default folders and when you log into it will be as if you logged in for the first time the reasoning and purpose of this is so we can see what a new user will experience when they use the live cd dvd for the first time since our global settings will only affect a new user we must make kde think your test account has never been logged into before each time we use it your initial desktop should look nothing like a standard kubuntu desktop which is good because we can now modify it in any manner we choose the following steps will take you from this to your final layout step by step in some cases i will tell you to hand edit the files and in others i will have you use the kiosk admin tool there are some cases where you can use either method and i will mention that however based on my experiences while putting this how to together i will emphasize what i feel is the better method of the two make sure all panel applets you wish to use are also installed most everything we want to do with the kicker panel needs to be done via the kiosk admin tool the final part of this step will require the hand editing of a file you will see and understand why when we get to that start by opening the kiosk admin tool you will find it under system in the programs section of the kde menu the default profile should be the only one listed and highlighted click on setup profile to start then click panel you will get a notice click ok to continue click setup panel to begin configuring the global default settings of the kicker panel just as if you were on your own desktop right click on kicker to bring up the options start with configure panel here you can set the panel looks and operations when you are all done setting up the panel use the add applet to panel to select what applets you want starting up and arrange them on the panel where you want go back to configure panel to make any final adjustments when done with that click on save in kiosk admin tool to save your changes now use the following command to do a bit of hand editing to your default settings kdesu kate etc kde profile default share config kickerrclook at the line labeled untrusted applets and see what s listed there if any applet you have previously selected is listed there then remove it from this line first make sure that you have installed the cursor theme you wish to use as the default the following information is from debian

the oxygen icon theme set for kde3 when they first login it will allow to bring up the theme dialog whether you create your own color scheme or use an existing one use of the kiosk admin tool is safest and most efficient way to import or select the color default and theme same with style and windows decorations once you have setup the decorations style and color themes click on save and exit kiosk admin tool test and see all your work come together in the test account to do so use the following command kdesu kate etc kde profile default share config ksplashrcsimply put in the following

kde3 kdm and over write the current kdmrc file then edit the file by hand kdesu kate etc kde3 kdm kdmrclook for the line theme and place the path to and the name of the kdm theme there you will be glad to know you will be able to use the kdm theme manager after that because the kdm theme setting is global that s all you need to do in kcontrol under system administration select login manager click on administrator mode and then enter your password click the background tab and select the background you want displayed i personally like to choose the same background as the one in my default

presentation 1soundfile usr share sounds kde logout new wavpresentation 1soundfile usr share sounds kde startup new wavnow lets look at this one a bit it took me awhile to figure this out unlike other configuration settings this is not a simple if else function where if the user has settings use them else use default in other words this works very differently from the other configurations and we need to know what is happening lets look at the knotify eventsrc file in my home directory here commandline logfile presentation 1soundfile commandline logfile presentation 1soundfile commandline logfile presentation 1soundfile commandline logfile presentation 1soundfile commandline logfile presentation 16soundfile commandline logfile presentation 0soundfile commandline logfile presentation

usr share sounds kde error 1 oggpresentation 1soundfile usr share sounds kubuntu login oggcarefully look at the user file then look at the default file you will notice that the lines in the default file fill in the missing lines from the user s file for example the kde startup sound is defined in our default file but the lines in the default file do not exist in the users file this is a typical entry for an event sound in the users file name of eventcommandline logfile presentation 2soundfile path and name of soundfileif we have a defined default sound then last two lines are removed and those lines are read from the default file making this an if then process if the presentation and soundfile lines are not present in file a then read from file b which makes for a somewhat confusing scenario add to that any attempt to dig up actual documentation on the file enteries utterly failed the only thing i could find out is if you set presentation 0 no sound will play for that event even if defined so in other words i haven t a clue about the rest of the entries and i have no idea what effect the numbers under presentation does though best guess is it s a time delay of some kind whatever means well your guess is as good as mine on that so with all that in mind if you decide to define default sounds then here is what i suggest you do to ensure they work use the presentation number as defined from the file i took from my kde share config folder in the file etc kde profile default share config knotify eventsrc make enteries like so presentation number as defined in the listsoundfile path name to filedo this for each event you want to have a default sound for now open a terminal and use the following command sudo apt get cleanclose the terminal in this case we want to make a distributable copy however we need to modify the remastersys config files first select modify the remastersys config file to customize options and click ok the only two you really need to concern yourself with are title and filename change those to what you want then return to the main menu select make a distributable copy to share with friends and click ok remastersys will now build your iso file that file once made will be located in home remastersys remastersys filename isoburn your first cd or dvd and test it out here is how the desktop on my live dvd came out

up exhausted and worn out no matter what but having people to help with things like set up and clean up and the games can make everything 100 times easier ask family members or close friends to lend a hand with the party especially if they ve got a kid coming to it it can be something as simple as bringing over some food helping put up decorations or even pick up the cake if it s a birthday party and you can t have your kid help you make the invitations and the decorations this can be a fun process for both of you it will lend a kid s touch to the proceedings which is really what it s all about right if you don t do this there are going to be meltdowns from the children and you ll end up as a de facto babysitter for some of the kids who aren t yours by having a specific time that you start and end you ll make sure that people get their kids out of the way before all the tantrums start if your child is at the age where they re still napping make sure that you don t schedule the party right during nap time that s basically a recipe for a meltdown keep to their schedule as much as possible by having it in the morning before the nap or in the afternoon after the nap keep the party short unless it is a sleepover in which case you ll want to limit the number of guests have the party go for about 1 1 2 hours to 2 hours this will help make sure you and your helpers don t get too exhausted even if you re a health nut about what food your kid eats you can still make it so the food at the party is food that they like and that the other kids will like parties are supposed to be fun and a little out of the ordinary especially if it s a birthday party or a party for a holiday like halloween try to avoid really messy foods this is why chips and snacks are so good for children s parties because they re easy to eat while you re running around for example spaghetti and meatballs is probably not a good choice for a kid s party especially one with lots of younger children depending on the type of party you can style the foods to go along with the theme for example for a halloween party you might have cookies shaped like pumpkins or delicious pumpkin bars you could have baked pumpkin seeds peeled grapes eyeballs and that sort of thing it can be a fun idea to have a build your own ice cream sundae or cupcake set out bowls of different sprinkles and different things they can build for dessert make sure that you ve put out newspapers underneath because sprinkles will get everywhere whatever kind of children s party you re throwing you want to make sure that the children are properly occupied in the time that you have 1 1 2 hours to 2 hours you ll probably want to have 1 or 2 activities too many and the kids will be all over the place and too few games the kids will get bored make sure that you have some activity planned right off the bat this eases the awkwardness and gets all the kids involved in something so that they aren t just running all over the place scavenger hunts are great fun for kids the level of difficulty can be raised or lower depending on the age of the children they can also be adapted to a variety of themes pirate treasure hunt a princess scavenger hunt find a pumpkin scavenger hunt simple make sure that there are prizes for all the children avoid competitive games you especially want to do this for younger children competitive games mean winners and losers and the losers will inevitably start to cry to avoid that have games like freeze tag where no one actually wins or loses this is an especially good idea for a birthday party because especially amongst the youngest crowd tantrums may be thrown because they want gifts too to avoid this have a little something for each child so that they feel included have goody bags most kids don t care that much what is in the goody bag they just like that they re getting something have it be a cheap small thing that goes along with the party s theme a sparkly princess hair clip or a pirate s eye patch if you don t want to overload them with candy too have a thing of animal crackers instead you could also do a craft project that they can then take home with them do something like make tie dye there are really easy kits out there so that it doesn t turn into a huge mess or get a bunch of different fun beads to make necklaces or have them draw something related to the theme of the party throwing a party for a teenager can be a difficult process since what they think is cool and what their parents think is cool often are in entirely different universes you will want plenty of time to check in with them about what they would like or if you re the teen planning the party you ll need plenty of time to check in with your parents and talk to your friends budget the party see what you can spend on things like food drinks decorations music and so on have the teen deal with invitations again parents usually don t understand what is cool or embarrassing for their teenagers and handwritten invitations could be just the ticket to loserville at school let them decide how they re going to invite people as long as it s the agreed upon guests and not open to every person in school while a theme party might not be cool enough for your teen there are lots of different kinds of parties to have is it a birthday party a holiday party like halloween a graduation party each of these will require different decorations if the teen wants decorations and sometimes different foods you should also think about the type of party in terms of its location a beach front party with a bonfire is going to require different set up and energy to pull off than a halloween party at your house an outside party is going to require weather preparations having an area nearby that s under some sort of cover for example remember a girls sleep over is going to be very different from a graduation party for the former a chaperone or parent will simply need to make sure that the girls aren t sneaking out otherwise you don t usually have to worry about them the latter type of party is more likely to get out of control and will need supervision you want to make sure that the teen s friends can make it to the party so try for advance notice for a bigger party like a birthday bash or halloween extravaganza a couple weeks at least for a smaller party you usually won t need as much time unless it s a really important party avoid school nights and sunday nights during the school year teens should hopefully be rested for school and have time to do their schoolwork partying will cut into that time make sure that the parents of the invited teens know what s going to be happening at the party pulling everything together will make the party successful this means having the right food and the right music if you ve planned it out beforehand this part shouldn t be too difficult for food you want something that is easy to snack on chips and dip pretzels candy and cookies pizza and some cut up veggies and dip are all great choices you could also cut up some fruit and have a fruit platter if you put some chocolate dip in the middle you ll have a fun and somewhat healthy option let the teens provide music themselves they will typically have ipods and phones packed with their types of music simply hook up some speakers and an mp3 hook up so they can have it louder to dance to if you re worried about the neighbors make sure to test it beforehand and check in with them for drinks you ll want sodas and water remember unless the drinking age is 18 or less you could get in trouble for having alcohol at the party even if you didn t provide it it s a good to use paper plates and cups and forks to make for less clean up afterwards teens aren t usually that picky about what they use to eat with if you re environmentally conscious there are usually biodegradable paper plates and things that you can use again this can depend on the type of party but it s usually a good idea to have different designated areas for different activities like dancing playing foosball video games an eating area make sure that you ve provided obvious trash containers in each area this will make it easier for them to be less messy and have the clean up be easier it s best if the teen figures out where each area to be with adult consent because they know their friends and peers best while having a chaperone hovering nearby can be off putting for teen parties not having some sort of supervision can result in a lot of poor decision making by the teens have the party if it s an adult doing the supervision try to be somewhere else during the party for example if the party is at the teen s house one of the parents or an older responsible sibling should be in one of the other rooms of the house occasionally check up on the party by doing a walk through on the way to the kitchen or the bathroom if there s someone who is in their late teens or twenties that is trustworthy see if they will chaperone the party they ll be a lot cooler than a parent but will still be able to keep the party from getting out of hand it s best to have the teen clean up as a part of their learning process they have the party they have to clean up afterwards it should also make it less likely that the party gets out of control because they know that they ll be taking care of whatever happens have a few friends stay afterwards to help with the clean up put on some music to make it more enjoyable it s best to decide this in advance so that you re able to invite the people you want and have the party that you want choosing the date will tell you how much time you have to get things ready unless you re only having a small get together you ll want to make sure that your guests have enough time to plan to make your party you also want to take into consideration things like the weather other events that are happening when you re picking the date for example you don t want to plan an outdoor party in the middle of winter or if you do you ll want to make sure both yourself and your guests are prepared you will need to know how much money you have to spend on the party since this will mean that you may need to come up with creative solutions in terms of food and drinks and entertainment it s a good idea to set out how much money you re willing to spend in certain categories drinks food entertainment decorations etc you can also think about what you would like to be able to do have a 20s themed party etc and figure out ways to make that possible on a limited budget for example print out prohibition era images drape your lamps in fabric tape bead chains to your ceiling to give the effect of a 20s speakeasy this could be a birthday party a cocktail party some sort of special celebration or just a friendly get together with your favorite people how you prepare for the party will depend on how big it is how lavish it is and what it is the party is about there are certain logistics to consider for different types of parties for example if you re planning a surprise birthday party for a friend you have to make sure that they ll be available that other people don t spoil the surprise that you have a way to get the friend to the party and so on now it s time to figure out who you re inviting and how many people you re inviting this will depend on things like the timing of the party what kind of party it is and what your budget is if you re having the party in your house or a friend s house consider how many people you can comfortably fit into it or not maybe you ll all be dancing up on one another if you ve decided to have a nice dinner party then you should probably keep down the number of people you re inviting make sure that you invite people you find interesting and who might find one another interesting the worst thing is when you invite people who are really unsuitable for one another and don t mesh well for example your friend from your punk rock group and your boyfriend s corporate work cronies now that you know what kind of party you re having and how many people you re inviting it s time to figure out where you re going to have the party if it s a dinner party or a small group of friends it s fine to have it at your house or apartment if it s going to be bigger you might want to start considering alternate options you also want to make sure that you re aware of the limitations offered by the different locations you re considering for example if you re having the party at your house and you only have a hot plate or a very small stove you might want to avoid food that you have to make or you might want to farm out that task on a friend if your party is too big for your house consider different options like having outside at the park or in a greenhouse having it at a museum going to a state park and having it there renting some sort of hall have the appropriate seating if you re having a sit down dinner you will definitely need to make sure that you have a seat for each person even if you re having a buffet style meal you ll want to make sure that people can sit down and eat otherwise you ll be having more spills to clean up parties have to have something that makes them enjoyable and makes them successful this can be anything from a sweet playlist to a full scale swing band board games or something like cards against humanity a theme like a noir murder mystery party or anything you want the more people you have the harder it would be to have a party that is about games because it would be hard to organize all those people not impossible if you really want to for large parties having music and a dance floor is a good idea you can even do a craft style party or a letter writing party have everyone bring there supplies provide tea or alcohol and have at it this is another reason why it s good to plan ahead and also why it s good to ask people to bring something you don t want to run out of drinks or food during the party a good idea for drinks is to have one signature drink in addition to the beer and wine people usually bring it could be something like champagne classy you can get prosecco for half the price you could also do something like a pitcher of sangria or margaritas make sure that you have drinks for the nondrinkers and the designated drivers if this is a party with alcohol you can do something fun for them like having bubbly water with a little fruit juice and some fruit for some creative food ideas you might try fondue you can have cheese fondue with bread and veggies and things and a dessert fondue with bits of cake or strawberries dipped in chocolate you could do your food buffet style and have a theme like mexican food night have people bring a little something to make the party planning and throwing easier on you ask people to bring something like some appetizers a nice wine or some beer this way all the food and drink planning won t rest entirely on your shoulders a good idea is to make a list of the food and drinks that you want at your party mark down which ones you are capable and your kitchen is capable of handling and then ask your guests to pick something that they can bring make sure that you enlist a couple of your closest friends to help you clean up after the party so you aren t stuck doing it by yourself depending on the time of the party afternoon all night morning etc you may want to wait and clean up the next day put on some music to help get you through the boring parts of the clean up and if you re with friends chat about the party and how much fun you had it will make you less irritated that you re having to clean everything up if you remember why you re doing it while this may seem like a not so creative option you can have many variations to spice it up theme parties are great both for parties where you ll be drinking and parties where you won t you can even pair them with other options like a 20s theme with a murder mystery or a pun theme where you play cards against humanity one theme idea is invent your superhero or villain come up with a costume and a backstory this is a great mingling idea because you can then spend a lot of the time asking people about their costumes another theme idea is the pun party where everyone dresses up as a pun for example you could be a wallflower and dress up as a flower against a wall or a flower made of of bits of a wall you could also do the seven deadly sins as a theme and have each room in your house correspond to one of the themes everyone can dress up as a version of one of the sins like carrying a mirror as vanity this is great fun because everyone can come dressed in their pajamas put on a movie or pull out all those games you played in elementary school like mash or truth or dare you could also have everyone help you build an awesome pillow fort and have everyone sleep in it that night this is where all you have at the party are desserts and everyone has to bring their favorite dessert you won t have to worry about alcohol or dinner or anything like that the desserts can even have themes dessert from around the globe etc some delicious dessert ideas are banana splits hot fudge sundaes different cakes and pies a whole slew of ice cream you could even make your own you can also have a baking party that turns into this have a bunch of friends over and make lots of different delicious desserts these are lots of fun and you can make them as fancy or as simple as you need likewise you can add another theme to this for example it could be a fancy dress tea party or everyone has to dress up as a character from a novel etc you could even go the alice in wonderland route have a mad tea party have everyone come dressed as characters from the book or movie or just really crazily and have giant teacups and a dormouse probably a stuffed animal is best

for great players or games to be compared to those who came before them it may not seem important to know who the top players were in the 1950s but having this knowledge will be helpful in understanding the culture of baseball and in writing about it effectively many people who are really interested in baseball history will watch or listen to old games from years gone by to get a deep understanding many historic games can be watched on youtube baseball has at times played an important part in other historical events influencing and feeling the impact of cultural changes political

baseline and then make adjustments for your beginning baseline start with your current monthly income this will give you an idea of how much you currently spend each month then deduct expenses that you currently have that will disappear after retirement for example suppose your current monthly income is 5 000 after taxes assume that your monthly expenses equal your monthly income so begin with this number deduct your savings after retirement you won t be saving any more suppose you save 500 each month deduct that from your total 5 000 500 4 500 displaystyle 5 000 500 4 500 deduct how much

and groceries suppose you can reduce your monthly transportation grocery and clothing budget by 300 per month but you plan to take one large trip each year for 5 000 so you plan to save 450 per month

benefits affects the percentage of benefits you will actually receive choosing the optimum age at which you should apply for benefits depends on many factors consider your life expectancy and financial picture to decide how long to wait waiting until full retirement age allows you to collect 100 percent of your social security benefits if you were born before 1938 full retirement age is 65 years old for those born in 1938 and after full retirement age can be up to 67 years of age to determine your full retirement age refer to the social security administration s retirement chart at https www ssa gov planners retire agereduction html if you can wait until age 70 to collect social security you can collect an even higher monthly check for example persons born after 1943 earn an increased benefit of 8 percent per year of deferral you can begin collecting social security as young as age 62 however you will receive a permanently reduced amount if your full retirement age is 67

of healthcare expenses pensions are defined benefit plans meaning that they provide you with a set amount each month in retirement other retirement plans like 401 k s are defined contribution plans which only pay out money that has been put into the account over the years these plans may also allows you to pick your own investments the amount distributed to the plan holder depends on how much they want to withdraw in other words pension plans place the investment risk on the plan provider whereas defined contribution plans place that risk on the plan holder a pension plan is a retirement account provided by your employer it pays out a fixed amount when you retire the amount it pays is based on your salary and how long you worked for your employer a pension is a defined benefit plan this means that your employer automatically enrolls you in the plan you may need to remain employed for a certain amount of time such as a year before you qualify for enrollment your employer makes all of the investment decisions usually through an investment firm vesting means acquiring ownership of your benefits you may need to work for a defined number of years before you become fully vested cliff vesting means that after a pre determined number of years of continuous employment you own 100 percent of your pension however if you leave before you become vested you forfeit any pension that has been saved for you graded vesting means that after a pre determined number of years you own a certain percentage of your pension the percentage you own increases incrementally the longer you remain employed by your employer after a certain number of years you become 100 percent vested keep your employer s vesting schedule in mind if you are considering a career change unlike other kinds of retirement accounts you may not be able to take your pension with you if you leave your job the amount of the pension you own when you leave your job depends on your employer s vesting schedule you cannot access your pension benefits until you reach retirement age the retirement age is defined by your pension plan typically you must be 65 years old some pension plans allow you to begin collecting benefits when you are as young as 55 years of age or in the event of a disability you may be able to start collecting your pension benefits before your retirement age however you will not receive 100 percent of your pension if you choose this option ask your employer to explain how your benefits vary depending upon the age at which you begin collecting you can choose between a lump sum payment or monthly annuity payments the option you choose depends on how much money you need per month your comfort level with managing the responsibilities of a large sum of money also matters if you aren t an experienced investor you may feel more comfortable with choosing to receive steady payments from your pension plan if you choose a lump sum payment you must understand how to budget it wisely and how to invest it so it continues to grow a lump sum payment may be taxed unless it is rolled into an individual retirement account ira if you choose to receive a lump sum payment you may be able to enjoy certain advantages with the help of a trusted financial advisor you can plan to invest the money and leave it to your heirs however you must also consider the responsibilities involved with a lump sum payment you don t have to worry about the financial health of your employer if your company goes out of business you don t have to worry that your pension benefits will go away invest your lump sum payment to allow it to continue to grow you can put it into an individual retirement account ira and put a portion of into an immediate annuity that pays you a monthly income this way you can enjoy a steady monthly income while allowing part of your pension to continue to grow your pension benefits may be subject to state and federal income taxes it depends on how your employer set up the plan contributions generally the taxable portion of your pension income is taxed at the same rate as your ordinary income the irs applies separate rules for qualified and non qualified pension plans the general rule applies to non qualified plans a non qualified pension plan does not get favorable tax treatment contributions made by your employer or you do not get taxed but any return on the investment does get taxed in the year in which you receive it the simplified rule applies favorable tax rates to qualified pension plans these are plans that accept pre tax contributions with these plans the benefit is fully taxable in the year in which you receive it however chances are that your tax bracket will be lower when you retire than it was when you were working therefore you won t pay as much in taxes on this income depending on the type of company for which you work your employer may either offer a 401 k or a 403 b plan you may be automatically enrolled in this type of plan and have employer matching where your contributions are matched by your employer depending on your employer s policies these accounts are separate from individual retirement plans like iras or roth iras which do not involved your employer contributions are made pre tax this means you only pay income taxes on the portion of your salary that you did not contribute to the retirement account the funds you contribute to the account are then invested to allow them to grow your employer may offer you a default investment or you may be able to choose how to invest the money your employer may also offer a matching program this means they may match your contributions up to a certain amount you must comply with the limits for contributions the contribution limits depend on your age and marital status as of 2015 for those under the age of 50 the maximum an individual can contribute is 18 000 per year or 1 500 per month couples can contribute up to 36 000 per year those over the age of 50 can contribute up to 24 000 per year per individual or up to 48 000 per year for a couple you pay income taxes on the money when you collect it during retirement this is a bank account that allows you to save money for retirement in a tax advantaged way also age and the amount of contributions you are already making to retirement accounts at work affect the tax advantages of your ira account with a traditional ira you may be able to deduct contributions to your ira on your tax return a rollover ira is funded with money from a 401 k or 403 b from a previous employer the tax advantages for which your ira qualifies depends on the type of ira account you open with a roth ira you make contributions to the retirement account post tax the money then grows tax free over time this means that when you withdraw the money during retirement you don t pay any taxes on it but you cannot deduct contribution from income as made an hsa account allows you to save for certain kinds of expenses such as doctor visits prescription medications dental and eye care and related costs then these expenses become tax deductible when you are preparing your annual tax return unlike other kinds of retirement accounts you can use the money before you retire the funds roll over from year to year and you must only use them on healthcare related expenses however once you are 65 you can withdraw the funds and use the money for anything the maximum annual contribution is 3 350 for an individual or 6 650 for a family the amount increases by 1 000 if a family member is 55 years of age or older downsizing is a part of many people s retirement plan however leaving the family home may also require leaving behind a community and connections that are important to you picking the right time to leave your family home is a personal decision for some the change happens when both partners in a marriage are still alive and want to spend time together in a different place for others the death of a spouse prompts the decision to move when you decide that the time has come to look for new housing in retirement consider not only your budget but also your lifestyle the proximity to your family and the status of your health if you are in good health you can choose to live independently however you must accept that changes in your health are an unavoidable part of aging your health status can change gradually or you may experience a sudden decline in health if you have enough money you can stay in your home and arrange for professional caretakers to help you if not you may have to arrange to either live with a family member or move to a facility where you will be cared for retirees have many different kinds of housing options each has its own advantages and shortcomings choose your living arrangement based on your needs lifestyle and family circumstances staying in your family home is one option to consider if it s not too big for you to manage it might be the best place for you because you are already connected to the community to make this work you may need to make plans to get help with home maintenance also down the road you may need to arrange for home health care if you stay in your home and have significant equity in that home you may be able to get a reverse mortgage this loan pays you for the equity in the home it is only available to those over the age of 62 moving to a townhouse or condominium community is an option if you don t want to have to worry about property maintenance you can choose a mixed age location or a 55 and older community depending on your preferences retirement communities are independent living quarters where you are provided with amenities such as chef prepared dining inside and outside property maintenance and a 24 hour nursing staff when you were younger you may have dreamed of retiring in a tropical paradise however actually doing this may isolate you from people you really need in retirement think about the effect of detaching from your community connections and family ties on a permanent basis this is an even bigger consideration if you are single if you can afford it consider purchasing a vacation home where you can live for part of the year this way you can have the best of both worlds where you end up in retirement will depend largely on your net worth and your monthly income retirement communities townhouses and vacation homes are expensive so are in home personal care and skilled nursing services if you haven t already done so create a monthly budget begin to plan for the long term and think about how you are going to support yourself physically and financially as you age enlist the help of you children and other family members in making these decisions if you are someone who felt defined by your career you may experience a significant sense of loss upon your retirement also the thought of somebody replacing you at work can make you feel unimportant it can be difficult to validate yourself without the connection to a career over time you may begin to feel depressed or anxious and you may even begin to second guess your decision to retire build a new identity for yourself by using your time to find meaningful ways to connect with other people and use your talents in a positive way some retirees find second careers either paid or on a volunteer basis that they find very gratifying when you are both working full time you and your spouse may have become accustomed to your independence from each other the changes to your daily routine in retirement may cause you to feel you ve given up some of this autonomy remember that with time you will learn to adjust to spending more time at home with your spouse however it s important to schedule some activities apart pursuing your separate interests think about how many hours per week you devote to your job not just the 40 hour work week but also commuting and spending time at home getting ready for work all of these hours will be free during your retirement plan how you will spend that time being productive to avoid boredom do volunteer work many people feel find fulfillment by devoting time to meaningfully giving back in some way spend more time being active participate in outdoor activities that you enjoy such as golf exercise frequently the physical activity will have an emotional and physical benefit plan to travel plan to visit children and grandchildren who do not live nearby schedule vacations to places you ve always wanted to see some people are homebodies and relish the idea of spending time on their own at home others are social butterflies and thrive on being around other people whichever you are you will need to schedule activities that give you social interactions joining clubs or groups taking classes or getting a part time job can provide you with the relationships you need to feel vital according to a study nearly 40 percent of americans age 55 and older are working in fact workers aged 55 and older accounted for virtually all of the workforce growth in the united states between 2007 and 2014 if you are physically still able to work consider extending your current employment as long as you can even if you qualify for retirement doing so will help you save even more for your eventual retirement according to a study done by merrill lynch in 2014 nearly 40 percent of americans age 55 and older are working in fact workers aged 55 and older accounted for virtually all of the workforce growth in the united states between 2007 and 2014 nearly 60 percent of retirees venture into a new line of work after the age of 55 also working retirees are three times more likely to be entrepreneurs than their younger counterparts delay tapping into your nest egg some people choose to continue working for financial reasons for example many companies have eliminated pensions also recent economic uncertainty has eaten away at many people s retirement savings in addition if your full retirement age for social security is 67 you may choose to continue working until you can collect your full benefits stay mentally active choosing to work in retirement isn t all about the money it is a way for people to stay mentally active as they age others are motivated by increasing life expectancy which means their retirement may last 20 years or more they are therefore motivated to find greater purpose social connections and fulfillment if you sign up for social security benefits before your full retirement age you will likely have your benefits withheld while you are still collecting a salary as of 2009 if you earn more than 14 160 you must give 1 back to social security for every 2 you earn if you are of full retirement age the limit is higher as of 2009 those at full retirement age could earn up to 37 680 and still collect social security benefits without a penalty most defined benefit pension plans are calculated based on a pre determined number of years if your tenure with the company exceeds that number of years you won t get any additional pension benefits also remember that your pension benefit is going to be based on your income for the last few years you worked if you work reduced hours in your later years your lower earnings could reduce your pension benefit also if you are enrolled in medicare your company s health insurance plan is going to try to make medicare your primary insurance this means you ll be responsible for the co pays and deductibles stated in your medicare plan which may be higher than those stated by your company s healthcare plan if you have already started to receive social security benefits or are collecting retirement income from a pension or an ira continuing to earn a paycheck on top of these income streams may bump you up into the next tax bracket this could cost you thousands of dollars in taxes if you are going to be receiving distributions from a 401 k you can delay the payments until after you stop working but if you have a traditional ira you must start receiving payments once you turn 70 even if you are still working

breadth of horror and special effects makeup having this knowledge will widen your creative scope so you come up with new ideas more easily and it will prevent you from making clich or outdated makeup choices now that you have basic knowledge and a library of inspiration it s time to experiment use either yourself or a friend to try out a bunch of looks have fun take risks and don t expect too much out of yourself this experimental phase will get you familiar with using materials and combining different horror makeup methods if you aren t enrolled in a makeup school and need more guidance as you experiment follow step by step tutorials on youtube created by special effects makeup artists even if you follow a tutorial try to add a personal touch it s important to exercise your creativity and to not get dependent on specific instructions as you start to do independent projects which you will eventually turn into a portfolio you can use to get a job you will need to come up with ideas for a characters or effects if you are in school you will be assigned a project and will likely have more specific guidelines if you are learning independently you will need to come up with an idea yourself don t feel your idea needs to be especially elaborate you can even start with just one word like zombie or monster in your planning stage you will flesh out this idea more no matter whether you are in a class or working independently never skip the planning stage this is the point of maximum creativity when you can use a pencil and paper to draw or write out your idea you ll find that when you allow yourself creative freedom your character may end up going in a much more interesting direction than when you started start by listing adjectives about your character or effect then start to draw the character in color you can even write a little story about your character or figure out its background getting more familiar with your character will give you a better sense of what he she or it looks like for instance maybe you started with the word monster add words like brown short and hairy you could make up a story about how this is a lonely monster that lives in the sewers of a large city and rarely sees sunlight just a short story like this can unfold a vision in your mind of the monster take your sketches and descriptions of your character and do the makeup either on yourself or on a friend you may have to practice this look a few times before coming up with something that you re proud of take a high definition photograph of your work from several different angles it s important to document your work so that you can eventually put it in your portfolio and show off your skills to potential employers if you did the makeup on yourself have a friend or family member take the photograph for you repeat the process of formulating an idea and creating a makeup look at least seven more times for each project pick ideas that are radically different from each other and showcase different skills this will show potential employers that you have a varied skill set and ample creativity for instance one project could be a minimal zombie makeup look just using paint another project could be an alien where you use a bald cap and a large prosthetic for the top of the head along with green and grey paint another could be a glamorous mermaid with scaly skin and a wig take all of your photographs from the projects you worked on and write a short description describing the idea for the makeup look and the inspiration you drew from then create both a physical portfolio and a digital portfolio that you will be able to show employers your description could look like this zombie this character makeup was created using paint and foam latex pieces the latex pieces were designed molded and attached to the subject to look like damaged and dead skin the illusion was enhanced by adding a greenish tinge to the skin using paint when you get started you may find it hard to find a job immediately strengthen your portfolio and gain experience by working on small projects such doing makeup for haunted houses amateur theatre productions or student film projects even if these projects don t pay they are a great way to get your work out there and to learn how to work with others add pictures from these projects into your portfolio because special

query	114	use the laws of sines and cosines when you are missing side lengths or angle measurements of any triangle you can use the law of sines or the law of cosines to help you find what you are looking for the law of sines is a sin a b sin b c sin c displaystyle frac a sin a frac b sin b frac c sin c the law of cosines is c 2 a 2 b 2 2 a b cos c displaystyle c 2 a 2 b 2 2ab cos c in each formula a displaystyle a b displaystyle b and c displaystyle c are the side lengths of the triangle the angle opposite each side has a corresponding uppercase variable depending on what information you know about your triangle you can use these two laws to solve for missing information using the law of sines to find a missing side length using the law of sines to find a missing angle using the law of cosines to find a missing side length using law of cosines to find a missing angle assess what you know identify and label sides and opposite angles find the missing angle set up the formula for the law of sines plug all the known values into the formula use a calculator to find the sines of the angles simplify the complete ratio set the incomplete ratios equal to the complete ratio set up an equation to find the missing angle find the sine of the known angle isolate the missing sine and simplify the equation find the inverse sine set up the formula for the law of cosines use a calculator to find the cosine of the angle square the known side lengths find the difference simplify the expression using the order of operations isolate the cosine find the inverse cosine to use the law of sines to find a missing side you need to know at least two angles of the triangle and one side length for example you might have a triangle with two angles measuring 39 and 52 degrees and you know that the side opposite the 39 degree angle is 4 cm long you can use the law of sines to find both missing side lengths the convention is that side lengths are labeled a displaystyle a b displaystyle b and c displaystyle c the angle opposite each side is denoted by the capital letter of that side s variable for example the angle opposite side a displaystyle a is a displaystyle a the angle opposite side b displaystyle b is b displaystyle b and the angle opposite side c displaystyle c is c displaystyle c for example in your triangle a 4cm displaystyle a 4cm a 39degrees displaystyle a 39 text degrees b displaystyle b b 52degrees displaystyle b 52 text degrees c displaystyle c c displaystyle c the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees thus if you know two angles of a triangle you can find the third angle by subtracting both angles from 180 for example since a 39degrees displaystyle a 39 text degrees and b 52degrees displaystyle b 52 text degrees c 180 39 52 89degrees displaystyle c 180 39 52 89 text degrees the formula is asina bsinb csinc displaystyle frac a sin a frac b sin b frac c sin c the formula shows that the ratio of one side of the triangle to the sine of the opposite angle is equal to the ratio of all other sides to their opposite angles make sure you substitute side lengths for the lowercase variables and angles for the capital variables also remember that opposite sides and angles should have the same letter for example 4sin39 bsin52 csin89 displaystyle frac 4 sin 39 frac b sin 52 frac c sin 89 you can also use a trigonometry table substitute the sines in the denominators of the ratios for example sin39 0 6293 displaystyle sin 39 0 6293 sin52 0 788 displaystyle sin 52 0 788 and sin89 0 9998 displaystyle sin 89 0 9998 so your ratios will now look like this 40 6293 b0 788 c0 9998 displaystyle frac 4 0 6293 frac b 0 788 frac c 0 9998 you have one complete ratio with an angle and side to simplify it divide the numerator by the denominator for example 40 6293 6 3562 displaystyle frac 4 0 6293 6 3562 to solve for a missing variable multiply the complete ratio by the denominator of either incomplete ratio for example 6 3562 b0 788 displaystyle 6 3562 frac b 0 788 6 3562 0 788 b0 788 0 788 displaystyle 6 3562 0 788 frac b 0 788 0 788 5 0087 b displaystyle 5 0087 b and6 3562 c0 9998 displaystyle 6 3562 frac c 0 9998 6

to use the law of sines to find a missing angle you need to know at least two side lengths and one angle for example you might have a triangle that has one side that is 10 cm long another side is 8 cm long and the angle opposite is 50 degrees you need to find the angle opposite the side that is 10 cm long the convention is that side lengths are labeled a displaystyle a b displaystyle b and c displaystyle c the angle opposite each side is denoted by the capital letter of that side s variable for example the angle opposite side a displaystyle a is a displaystyle a the angle opposite side b displaystyle b is b displaystyle b and the angle opposite side c displaystyle c is c displaystyle c for example in your triangle a 8cm displaystyle a 8cm a 50degrees displaystyle a 50 text degrees b 10cm displaystyle b 10cm b displaystyle b c displaystyle c c displaystyle c since you want to find the angle opposite the 10 cm side you are looking for angle b take care to substitute the values correctly so that the side lengths are in the numerators of the formula and their opposite angles are in the corresponding denominators for example 8sin50 10sinb csinc displaystyle frac 8 sin 50 frac 10 sin b frac c sin c to do this set the complete ratio equal to the ratio with the angle you are solving for take the reciprocal of each ratio so that the side length is in the denominator and the sine of the angle is in the numerator for example since you know side a displaystyle a and angle a displaystyle a and are solving for angle b displaystyle b you would set up the ratio 8sin50 10sinb displaystyle frac 8 sin 50 frac 10 sin b taking the reciprocals you have sin508 sinb10 displaystyle frac sin 50 8 frac sin b 10 use a calculator or trigonometry table to do this plug the decimal into the equation for example sin50 0 766 displaystyle sin 50 0 766 so the equation should now look like this 0 7668 sinb10 displaystyle frac 0 766 8 frac sin b 10 to do this multiply each side of the equation by the unknown angle s denominator then simplify the remaining ratio for example sin508 sinb10 displaystyle frac sin 50 8 frac sin b 10 0 7668 10 sinb10 10 displaystyle frac 0 766 8 10 frac sin b 10 10 0 766 108 sinb displaystyle frac 0 766 times 10 8 sin b 7 668 sinb displaystyle frac 7 66 8 sin b 0 9575 sinb displaystyle 0 9575 sin b the inverse sine is shown by the sin 1 displaystyle sin 1 button on a calculator the inverse sine will give you measurement of the missing angle for example the inverse sine of 0 9575 is 73 2358 so angle b displaystyle b is about 73 24 degrees to find a missing side length using the law of cosines you need to know the length of the other two sides of the triangles and the measurement of the angle between them for example you might have a triangle with sides that are 5 and 9 cm long and the angle between them is 85 degrees you need to find the length of the missing side the convention is that side lengths are labeled a displaystyle a b displaystyle b and c displaystyle c the angle opposite each side is denoted by the capital letter of that side s variable for example the angle opposite side a displaystyle a is a displaystyle a the angle opposite side b displaystyle b is b displaystyle b and the angle opposite side c displaystyle c is c displaystyle c for example in your triangle a 5cm displaystyle a 5cm a displaystyle a b 9cm displaystyle b 9cm b displaystyle b c displaystyle c c 85 displaystyle c 85 since you want to find the side opposite the 85 degree angle you are looking for side c displaystyle c the formula is c2 a2 b2 2abcosc displaystyle c 2 a 2 b 2 2ab cos c in this formula c displaystyle c is the missing side length make sure you substitute the correct values for the correct variables the side you are trying to find should be c displaystyle c and the angle you know should be c displaystyle c for example c2 52 92 2 5 9 cos85 displaystyle c 2 5 2 9 2 2 5 9 cos 85 plug this value into the equation and multiply for example cos85 0 0872 displaystyle cos 85 0 0872 so your equation should now look like this c2 52 92 2 5 9 0 0872 displaystyle c 2 5 2 9 2 2 5 9 0 0872 multiplying you get c2 52 92 7 844 displaystyle c 2 5 2 9 2 7 844 remember that to square a number means to multiply the number by itself square the numbers then add them together for example c2 25 81 7 844 displaystyle c 2 25 81 7 844 c2 106 7 844 displaystyle c 2 106 7 844 this will give you the value of c2 displaystyle c 2 then you can take the square root of both sides of the equation to find c displaystyle c for example c2 106 7 844 displaystyle c 2 106 7 844 c2 98 156 displaystyle c 2 98 156 c2 98 156 displaystyle sqrt c 2 sqrt 98 156 c 9 9074 displaystyle c 9 9074 thus side c displaystyle c is about 9 91 cm long to find the missing angle using the law of cosines you need to know the length of all three sides of the triangle for example you might have a triangle with sides measuring 14 17 and 20 cm you need to find the angle opposite the 20 cm side the convention is that side lengths are labeled a displaystyle a b displaystyle b and c displaystyle c the angle opposite each side is denoted by the capital letter of that side s variable for example the angle opposite side a displaystyle a is a displaystyle a the angle opposite side b displaystyle b is b displaystyle b and the angle opposite side c displaystyle c is c displaystyle c for example in your triangle a 14cm displaystyle a 14cm a displaystyle a b 17cm displaystyle b 17cm b displaystyle b c 20cm displaystyle c 20cm c displaystyle c since you want to find the side opposite the 20 cm side you are looking for side c displaystyle c the formula is c2 a2 b2 2abcosc displaystyle c 2 a 2 b 2 2ab cos c in this formula c displaystyle c is the angle you are trying to find make sure you substitute the correct values for the correct variables the angle you are trying to find should be c displaystyle c this means that c displaystyle c should be the side opposite the angle you are trying to solve for example 202 142 172 2 14 17 cosc displaystyle 20 2 14 2 17 2 2 14 17 cos c first find the squares of the side lengths then make the appropriate multiplications then add for example 202 142 172 2 14 17 cosc displaystyle 20 2 14 2 17 2 2 14 17 cos c 400 196 289 2 14 17 cosc displaystyle 400 196 289 2 14 17 cos c 400 196 289 476 cosc displaystyle 400 196 289 476 cos c 400 485 476 cosc displaystyle 400 485 476 cos c to do this subtract the sum of the squares of sides a displaystyle a and b displaystyle b from each side of the equation then divide each side by the cosine s coefficient for example 400 485 476 cosc displaystyle 400 485 476 cos c 400 485 485 485 476 cosc displaystyle 400 485 485 485 476 cos c 85 476 cosc displaystyle 85 476 cos c 85 476 476 cosc 476 displaystyle frac 85 476 frac 476 cos c 476 0 1786 cosc displaystyle 0 1786 cos c use the cos 1 displaystyle cos 1 key on a calculator to do this the inverse cosine will give you the measurement of the missing angle for example the inverse cosine of 0 1786 is 79 7134 so angle c displaystyle c is about 79 71 degrees 
query	115	file a complaint complaints may arise at work school home or out in public in a government office or large corporation complaints may be filed regarding discriminatory practices unsafe work environments or illegal practices at home complaints may be related to noisy neighbors unlivable conditions or negligent landlords school related complaints range from student bullying to abusive teachers to unsafe environments depending on the situation you may file a complaint over the phone in person or in writing preparing to file a complaint formulating the complaint filing a verbal complaint filling out a complaint form writing a letter of complaint working through the complaint moving forward after the complaint identify the core issue s ask yourself if it s worth your time determine the proper complaint filing procedure each setting will require a different procedure which you should be able to find online on your company s or school s website in your employee or student handbook or by contacting an administrator know what solution you want knowing what sort of resolution you want and then clearly articulating it is key to filing an effective complaint regardless of whether it s against a company or a person gather your supporting documents keep these in a file or a folder on your computer if they re electronic documents and continue to update them as your case progresses keep records of everything keep a journal optional be specific clearly state your desired resolution when you file a complaint the people on the other end will be more likely to help you if you clearly state your desired resolution be respectful ask questions that demand more than yes or no responses polish your complaint practise your verbal complaint out loud focus on the facts report the facts of the situation in detail ask questions ask about the next steps determine which form you need provide complete information sign and date the complaint form make a copy of the complaint form write a complaint letter in lieu of a form provide the appropriate information at the top of the letter introduce yourself describe the events or acts that transpired ask for appropriate action to be taken request a confirmation that the letter has been received keep it as short as possible follow up on your complaint be prepared for it to escalate know your rights stay respectful continue to keep records of all communications be prepared for things to change let it go learn from the experience see a counsellor focus on the actual events that took place it s important to separate facts from feelings particularly in emotionally charged situations if the situation is particularly complex you may find it helpful to write your thoughts and feelings down in a journal getting a better sense of your feelings may help you separate them from the facts of your complaint if you are having trouble figuring out whether you should complain consider consulting an unbiased third party if you do this make sure that it s someone you trust who won t share any details of your situation without your approval filing a complaint can be a lengthy and stressful process it s important to ask yourself if filing a complaint is worth your time particularly if you have a lot of other things to do example you buy a 5 box of hair dye that fails to dye your hair the promised color you send an email to the company asking for a refund or a coupon for another box of dye and they say no if you escalate the situation by asking to speak to a superior you may still be able to get what you want but it will take time and the end result will be using more of the company s products you might find that it s not worth the trouble the contact person may be your supervisor your landlord your school s principal or another relevant person in charge if the person you wish to complain about happens to be the primary contact for complaints you should contact someone higher up than them for example if you want to file a complaint about your boss you will likely need to contact human resources you may be advised to speak to a specific individual appear in person write a letter or fill out a form solutions will differ depending on the context of your complaint if you re calling or emailing a company to complain about a faulty product you ll need to first familiarize yourself with their return policies if they only replace faulty products and do not refund them but you do not want the same product you might ask if they can grant you a store credit instead if you re complaining about a boss s or a teacher s misconduct possible resolutions might be that you can transfer to another work branch or department or change classes or schools in more extreme cases you may even believe that the person deserves to lose their job the more evidence that you have the more effective your complaint will be examples of supporting documents for a retail transaction could include sales receipts product listings and email exchanges for a complaint against a boss or teacher supporting documents may include inappropriate emails and facebook messages journal entries detailing instances in which you were mistreated or letters of support from witnesses the types of records you keep will depend on the context of the complaint if you re lodging a complaint against a business you ll want to have records of your communications with them as well as any receipts for products purchased if you purchased a faulty product keep records of the specific times and ways in which it was faulty in addition note what you ve done if anything to try to fix the problem unless you have witnesses it will be more difficult to file a complaint against a boss or teacher who is verbally abusing or harassing you administrators will commonly ask for a detailed account of your interactions with the person in question so it s best to keep a journal often in cases of misconduct in the workplace or school mediators will give more weight to your complaint if you have kept a journal if you think that you may have a problem with a boss teacher or other superior it s hugely helpful to keep a journal of your interactions date your pages and be as detailed as possible about what was said and done try to focus as much as possible on facts as opposed to feelings as handing over a journal full of emotional outbursts against the person may undermine your complaint if you want to lend more weight to your journal you might consider doing it in the form of emails to yourself just so that the dates are recorded in something other than your own handwriting you can keep these emails in a separate folder of your email account just be sure that you don t accidentally send them to anyone other than yourself keeping a journal may seem stupid since you could make the whole thing up but administrators do place a lot of weight on it besides satisfying administrators maintaining a journal can actually help you keep your facts straight during what can end up being a long and confusing complaints process regardless of whether you re complaining about a product or a person s behaviour your complaint will be more effective if you are specific about what has happened in the case of a complaint about a company s service you might write about how the product specifically broke down provide the details of your communications with the company thus far including any documents evidence possible and then state how you are unhappy with the service you ve received thus far in the case of a complaint against a boss or teacher for harassing you you would describe when the problem started exactly what the boss teacher said or did and how long it went on for i e give a timeline of the harassment you would also include descriptions of anything you did to try to avoid that person s unwanted attention and if applicable give evidence for the ways in which their behaviour affected your work doing this may also help the complaint process move along much more quickly in the case of a faulty product i purchased xyz app 20 days ago and since then whenever i use it my device freezes and the only way i can get it to unfreeze is to restart it i complained to customer service 10 days ago and was sent a brief response 9 days ago that told me to remove and re download the app i did that 9 days ago and it is still not working i sent an email 7 days ago and have not received any responses at this point i would like a refund if possible in the case of misconduct on september 10 last year i attended an office hour with dr smith during the office hour and in several instances after that initial time dr smith made sexually aggressive comments and movements towards me which made me feel uncomfortable i am struggling because i am depending on him to pass my class but i do not feel comfortable working with him alone at this time i would like to report his behaviour in order to prevent him from doing this to other people i would also like to be moved to another class complaints can get emotional particularly if you re not achieving your desired resolution it s important to remain respectful at all times from the time that you submit your complaint to the time that you receive the decision anything you do or say to suggest that you cannot control your emotions may reflect badly upon you making it less likely that your complaint will achieve its desired results this is particularly true for complaints about other people s misconduct no matter what you re complaining about being respectful and polite is more likely to make people want to help you than the shouting and swearing some people might even just straight refuse to help you if you shout and swear at them and rightfully so instead of saying can i get a refund or will he be disciplined you might ask what can be done to help this situation whether you re filing a verbal complaint or a written one write it down and give it an edit before submitting it if it s a verbal complaint you can write out a script and read it out loud before deciding on a final version this isn t only about ensuring that you re spelling thing correctly it s also about ensuring that you ve said all that you want to say and that you ve done it in the most effective way possible extreme frustration or emotions can cloud your thinking that s why it s important to really know what you want to say before calling in a verbal complaint you may find it helpful to write out a script or at least write down your main points so that you can check them off as you go when making points writing a script for your verbal complaint focus on the facts when you re feeling emotional take a deep breath and look down at your script notes then return to the facts being overly emotional will only make you look weak and unreliable to the people you re complaining to some people might even think they ve go the upper hand when they see that you are emotional it may be tempting to gloss over details when you speak things out loud as opposed to writing them down it s important to be just as clear and detailed when making a verbal complaint identify the actual events relevant conversations and or important transactions that have led to your complaint if the person to whom you re speaking says anything that you don t understand stop them politely and ask them to clarify before you have finished speaking to the person make sure that you know what the next steps are possible next steps when you can expect a response who might be contacting you next who you can contact in the meantime if you have any questions or remember any more details while you re waiting for a response a standard complaint form may be required when submitting complaints in academic corporate and government settings sometimes the form will differ depending on the nature of your complaint if you have any questions about which form you need double check with an administrator if you need to ask about which form you need you needn t be too specific about the nature of your complaint for example i would like to file a complaint against a teacher who is sexually harassing me complaint forms will request your name the date of the incident the name of the offender and the acts and events that you find damaging or offensive be sure to respond to all of these requests as clearly and specifically as possible complaint forms generally require a signature and may not be processed without one keep the copy in a safe place so that you can review the facts at a later date if necessary if you don t have access to a photocopier you can make a copy of the form by taking a high resolution photograph of it with your camera or phone if you end up taking a photograph of the form make sure that the photograph is clear before you submit the form otherwise it won t be a useful copy to you if it s an online form you can make a copy of it by saving it as a pdf or by taking a screenshot of it often you ll be prompted to print a form after you ve filled it out if this happens choose print to pdf in the printing prompt in certain environments a formal complaint filing procedure may not exist in that case writing a complaint letter is important for documenting the events you may even want to do this in combination with a verbal complaint just so that there s a written record that your complaint has been submitted this includes the date that you re writing the letter as well as the name professional position if applicable and address of the person to whom you re writing if the recipient of the complaint letter does not know you provide enough relevant and personally identifiable information that they get a sense of who you are such information includes your name position address phone number and your relationship to the offender s recount the relevant conversations dates transactions and any actions you have already taken provide all necessary information such as how much money you lost or who and how many people were involved explain your expectations whether you are expecting a refund an apology or some other remedy ask the recipient to indicate that your letter has been received and to clarify the time frame for resolving the issue let them know how they contact you for example by phone email post or all three try to keep your letter as short as possible stick to the facts and avoid getting overly emotional if you re describing a situation in which you were harassed or abused it s important to note that you felt uncomfortable or at risk unsafe but try to state this in more objective as opposed to emotional language more objective when i was in his office he closed the door and pulled his chair very close to me within about 1 foot of my knees i moved my chair back but hit the wall and he moved in closer and leaned his face toward me and told me how great i looked standing in front of class during my presentation today at that moment i felt uncomfortable and trapped as i was against the wall and couldn t move away from him i didn t want to upset him so i found an excuse to leave as soon as i could emotional when i was in his office he shut the door trapping me inside with him as he moved closely toward me and told me how hot i was before obviously trying to kiss me i felt terrified and was worried he might attack me but i couldn t move because he had me trapped against the wall at that point i ran out as soon as i could if you have not heard back within the expected time frame contact the complaint recipient to inquire about the delay unless the company person has told you otherwise an appropriate time to wait might be two weeks if you have not heard anything within two weeks it s within reason to contact them and politely ask whether they received your complaint if you re communicating by email you can attach another copy of your complaint to your message in case they didn t receive it the first time familiarize yourself with the levels that your complaint will go through if you are struggling to resolve your issue you may need to seek legal help if you have a complaint against a business your first point of contact should be the manager or owner of the business if that doesn t work and if the business is a chain you can contact their head office if that fails you might consider filing a complaint with the better business bureau if you have a complaint against your boss or a teacher be prepared for your complaint to travel through several channels its path will depend on your company s school s process for complaints an example of complaining about a professor at a university would be to first submit a written complaint to your head of department as long as the head isn t the offending prof you might then need to speak to the faculty dean and depending on the nature of your complaint a specific member of the department that relates to your complaint e g plagiarism or sexual harassment will be dealt with by different departments some companies and schools will try to defend the person who has been the cause of your complaint they will do this because it could be quite expensive for them to fire that person even if that person has clearly been the one who misbehaved they may try to make you feel as though you ve made a mistake or that you re blowing things out of proportion it s possible that you are but if you know you aren t don t let them tell you you re wrong if your complaint is something serious it deserves serious treatment unfortunately particularly in misconduct cases the company school will often protect the offender if they are in a position above you as to admit wrongdoing could cost them a lot of money your complaint may not go the way you want it to but it s important to remain respectful to everyone involved don t let your emotions get the better of you the more emotional you appear the less likely people are to take you seriously or want to help as you work through the complaint ensure that you keep records of all emails phone calls and or any other communications you may need to refer back to these to protect yourself or remind the company school etc of things that they have promised chances are the offending party will not be pleased with your complaint they might even fight back and this could be stressful for you you have to be prepared for the fact that your complaint might make things harder for you if you make a complaint against someone in the workplace or at school you may be asked to sit down with the offending person and work things out so that you can continue to work together in the future if it escalates to this level depending on the offending person s maturity they might hold resentment toward you and things could just get worse if things become too difficult you might consider moving to a different school or job or asking to be transferred to a different department or class so that you do not need to see that person any more ideally your complaint will lead to a satisfying resolution unfortunately many complaints do not if yours does not you ll need to know when it s time to let go remember that you made the complaint because you were unhappy with the way things were going the most important thing is that you are no longer unhappy you must make this the focus of your efforts no matter what the outcome of the complaint process is if there s nothing else that can be done try to learn a lesson from your experience and then work on moving forward if you are unsure of what you can learn from the experience consider asking this can be particularly useful in a misconduct situation where you are meeting with people who are trained in conflict management when they give you the bad news you might say i have to admit that i m disappointed with this outcome i don t want it to continue affecting my life do you have any suggestions for how i might move on from this if your complaint was with a company s faulty products and poor customer service some lessons you might take from your experience could involve anger management clear communication skills and a finer tuned ability to seek out reputable companies with good products seeing a counsellor could help you work through any feelings that may have been brought up during the complaint process particularly if it s one of a more personal nature

cattle interactions herding with cattle in pasture or corral separating one or more from the herd putting cattle through a handling facility acknowledge how your frame of mind and behaviour will influence animal movement understand the difference between human instinct versus bovine instinct recognize the possibility that instinctual human behaviour has a significant influence on how animals are going to respond understand how cattle think and what they like to do familiarize yourself with how cattle move in response to pressure understand why release is important after applying pressure watch some cattle handling videos by stockmanship experts to get a feel of what s involved realize that each situation you walk into will be different assess the animals get them up and started develop good movement of the herd maintain good movement move them towards and through the gate slow them down or stop them perform the steps mentioned above for starting and developing good movement in a herd focus on one or more animals to split out begin working animals so that you are walking past the ones you don t want to bring with you herd the animals similar to that mentioned in the last section to the place where you want to place them move cattle from the pasture or corral using the steps from the sections above into a holding pen move a smaller group from the main holding pen or one of them if there is more than one such pen into a smaller pen or holding alley move the first small group into the crowding tub or bud box put them down the working alley from the tub or box encourage movement into the squeeze by walking in the opposite direction that they are to go process each animal in the squeeze or head gate or just hold them for a few seconds then release them all animals including cattle are incredibly sensitive to our attitude and our frame of mind and will always be a mirror to what we re actually feeling even when we don t realize it at the time if you are excited or tense they will also be excited and tense if you are calm and quiet they will also be calm and quiet when working with cattle then it is so very important to be in the right frame of mind because cattle are more likely to respond well versus if you were not in the right frame of mind in other words if you are working cattle in an anything but calm emotional state those animals are surely going to be anything but calm too you may find that you can work with cattle and this goes for any other animal dogs cats goats horses or even chickens if you allow yourself to have a clear head and a calm attitude you may find that by putting yourself in a calm state you will be able to think more clearly and deliberately communicate your intentions to the animals you are working with and the animals are less likely to be confused as well your behaviour has a huge influence on how even an individual cow not to mention an entire herd regardless of size will perceive you if your behaviour is such that you don t care or are holding back too much they ll take advantage of that and not interested in doing as you ask on the opposite spectrum if you re too aggressive and forceful they also won t be interested in listening to you so to be successful pick the middle of the road be intentional in your actions be deliberate and be assertive but never to the point of being aggressive and forceful just to give you a taste humans and cattle sit at the opposite end of the spectrum we have humans which are predatory animals and cattle which are prey animals humans as predatory animals aren t much different from other predatory animals in how we perceive ourselves and those around us when working with animals not just cattle our instincts are to slow or stop animalswant animals to face us give us eye contact not turn away because to us this means they re going to run away keep pushing or push from behind even when animals are already on their way and know where they re going circle around classic predatory behaviour to cut off or as already mentioned stop or slow down animals to give chase because we think something is trying to run away this goes right back to instinctually wanting to slow or stop an animal not to back up but rather stay put or just keep pushing forward or even turn away cows and other prey animals horses goats bison sheep chickens elk buffalo and even pigs think differently from us their instincts are to want to see what is pressuring them move in the direction they are headed i e if they want to go to that patch of woods that s where they ll go if they re heading straight they ll go straight follow other animals have very little patience in other words they won t wait around for long if you re trying to figure out how to move them so they ll just keep going or doing what they were going to do in the first place or whatever first pops in their heads we have to remember that because cattle are prey animals they are going to respond as prey animals will and that is if they find any animal acting as a predator regardless if it s a wolf or a man they will act as any prey animal will and choose flight first before stopping and facing said predator as a last ditch defence cattle instinctually know how to avoid predators those that have had to live for extended periods without human contact and there are many of such animals that exist in many parts of the world have had to tap into those instincts to survive some livestock handling methods recommend to act like a predator to successfully move cattle but these methods may not always work because it doesn t build trust nor give your animals the means to believe that you are not there to hurt them or cause fear instinctively predatory actions induce fear into prey animals which goes hand in hand with mistrust just like you d want your horse to trust you enough to allow you on his back you should want your cattle to trust that you are going to move them to some place where they feel safe and also move them in a way that they are all going to willingly go there you can easily tell if your animals do not trust you and don t want to do as you are asking by the way their heads are held high up ears pricked bodies tense with that look like they re ready to flee and how they are hesitate and resistant to move going back to the second part of step 2 above the instincts of cattle are basically from that of a one track mind they just want to go where they re headed see what s pressuring them and follow others going beyond that when working closely with cattle some extra points to realize that livestock like doing livestock like to go by us they also like to go around us cattle always like to go back the same way they came from they prefer to go back to the last place they felt safe each individual animal has what is called a flight bubble or flight zone which can also be called a pressure zone though arguably the pressure zone is just slightly outside of the true flight zone this zone is basically an invisible oval bubble surrounding the animal its size varies for each animal from almost no discernible zone to a zone that can be least 50 yards 46 m in size for example bison typically have a larger pressure flight zone bubble than cattle do this bubble is used as a means to move animals done so in a way that it takes advantage of an animal s zone of comfort as well as point of vision thus when moving an animal you should always be where the animal can see you cattle have a 330 field of vision they don t see very well right in front of their noses and can t see directly behind them so do not pressure them at either of these points instead to take advantage of this pressure zone you must apply pressure from either hip or either shoulder right up to the neck a cow will move forward if you continually correct her from the hip or by crossing in behind whenever she needs to turn her head to see you this is why it s so important to make sure you are where you can be seen to turn an animal go in the opposite direction of where you want the cow to go just like you would with backing up a trailer if an animal is turning to look at you it s because you re not in a place where they can see you or feel you pressuring them to move either you need to move out farther to the side or you need to move closer manipulating this bubble so that the animal goes to where you ask it takes patience and knowing how to move on your part you will not always be moving forward you will have to often either stop move away walk with the animals or back up to release pressure off the animal release is a form of reward and a way to remove the stress we put on animals to get them moving in the direction we ask them to release works hand in hand with pressure and should always be kept in conjunction with pressure in order to give animals the sense that they re doing something good and that it s always going to come after pressure is applied to apply release is to slow down stop move away walk with the animals or back up depending on the location of where animals are being handled and how they are responding to pressure doing these will not only relieve pressure on the animals for us to be able to make necessary adjustments but also draw animals toward us or slow down stop the animals the first taste of learning proper herdsmanship or stockmanship of working cattle is going to seem confusing and will require lots of practice and continual learning bud williams for instance was always learning how to best handle cattle up to when he passed away other stockmen like steve cote richard mcconnell and tina williams dylan biggs and curt pate are other good people worth looking into and learning more from temple grandin is also good for a lot of basics with handling cattle you will want to do and try different things with them and they will certainly be posing different challenges for you that you need to be ready for and let the animals teach you about no herding scenario is going to be perfect each and every time watch their behaviour before you go in and gather them up they may already be laying down or watching you intently with the ears pricked and heads up you will need to react and start them accordingly the first thing and most important thing that you need to do is to get the herd started this is also the first part of training of both you and the cattle to drive properly getting started is generally getting the herd gathered up enough that you re getting good movement from them the herd as from step 2 above may either be calmly laying down and chewing their cud or watching you intently as you move closer to them the added difficulty will be when working with cattle that have not yet been trained to herd properly so be prepared for some flighty animals at first it s important to give them time to think and gather themselves up let them stretch if you have cows to gather up and join up with their calves take a few bites of grass etc before getting them moving allow them to take a few steps ahead before you begin pressuring and guiding them to generate that good movement good movement means that animals will be moving freely and comfortably acting and feeling relaxed with their heads bobbing as they walk along when animals are going in the direction you want them to stragglers will be drawn in to the main herd and they will even stay where you place them if good movement was used to get them there if they are flighty and high headed don t feel the need to rush into things instead go slowly and take your time if they run away let them but you will need to keep moving and trail them where they go never moving at them directly behind them nor curve around them make straight lines as a form of pressure and release until they settle down and realize you are not a threat if animals are laying down and quietly chewing their cud then you will need to get them up to do this walk to the hip or shoulder until they make the movement to get up then immediately move away to the next animal if there s an animal already getting up before you get to it move away from that and keep going until all animals are up and ready to go it s so important to never ever give that one little extra push when they re already doing what you want them to do once they re already up and or moving away then just let them you can come back and correct where they re going soon enough the hardest part of getting them started is actually getting them started the next problem is getting them going in a direction you want to go and leaving them alone as soon as they do so the other challenging part is how far out in a straight line you need to go to get animals moving or to turn them without compromising movement or direction of travel this will take much experimenting on your part and continual reading of how animals will respond once the animals are up and beginning to move you will need to move in straight lines never straight to the head nor straight at the rear to get the herd moving in the direction you want to go the rule of thumb to use is to generally move perpendicular to the direction the herd should be going when walking behind a herd in a pasture this means straight zig zag patterns when making zig zags it s completely fine to cross behind an animal and to make an angle to the hip shoulder belly or neck of the outside animal to get maximum influence of movement just remember once the animal is going in the direction you want it to leave it immediately think of moving a herd being like moving a wall by yourself you have to walk to one edge and back to another to get movement going straight ahead if you want to turn a certain way little movement is needed on one end versus the other depending on how sharp or wide a turn that needs to be made and how much space you have to do it to move a herd to the right go left to move a herd to the left go right this is no different when trying to turn an individual cow in order to get her moving straight zig zags back and forth to guide her is what will get her going straight relatively speaking depending on how far strung out the herd is the zig zag pattern may vary from one step in one direction and another step the other or several steps one way and several steps the other way use your animals and your choice direction as a guide to tell how many steps you need to make one way versus another as already mentioned good movement is achieved when animals are relaxed their heads are bobbing as they walk and they re moving at a comfortable pace other stock will be drawn out from wherever they are hiding and come in to the main herd it s important to not pay much attention to these stragglers but also to make sure you are not ahead of the rear most animal you too must maintain that zig zag pattern to keep that good movement going as the points and steps above have already mentioned there is no defined number of steps you need to cut in or out to maintain good movement and direction this is far more of a matter of constant trial and error and learning to read your animals effectively good movement isn t always nor necessarily slow and steady if animals are feeling a little frisky and lively they may run for a little ways and you ll have to do your part to keep up and if they want to move slow then let them move slow you can also control their speed if you angle a bit more harder into them they will speed up angle less into them they will slow down a herd with good movement will always draw in the stragglers no matter where they are animals will tell you if you are too close or too far behind too much turning may mean you need to back off and give them a little more space but if they re turning around to look at you you may need to either move up closer or move farther out it s less important to know where the gate is than it is to get them going in a direction you want them to go adjustments to direction may need to be made if there are certain objects in the way ranging from a hill to a telephone pole but generally the direction of travel should go back to where you are intending while this may sound like a scary challenge it doesn t have to be just remember always t to the gate think of an upside down t with the end of this upside down t at the gate and the perpendicular line to this t your direction of travel the herd is along the line between the gate and your perpendicular direction of movement your job is to guide the herd from the rear towards the gate opening guiding from the corners and pressuring from the side this t will be continually shifting according to the changes made by the herd remember you are always working back and forth in a straight zig zag pattern if the herd is not moving in a straight line to the gate then shift your line so you continue to work in a straight line to the gate your angle of attack should always be move right to move the animals left and move left to get the animals to move right continue with this t to the gate even as they go through it s very important to never encircle the herd or create a horse shoe because this could cause one or more animals to break away from the gate keep working in a straight line until all animals are through that gate it s also critically important to never post someone near the gate this actually distracts the animals and causes some to break away in other words if you are worrying about animals not going through the gate and feel the urge to go and correct some potential movement then don t you are more likely to create the very problem you re worried that s going to happen rather you are more likely to make animals not go through the gate if you try to correct them versus if you just maintained your t to the gate movements until all animals are past that gate the t to the gate is very similar to and can be also used when loading cattle onto a trailer in the middle of a pasture it s also used for any size of herd but the larger the herd the larger the t and the more people that may be needed to form this t to the gate this method used properly will eliminate the need for using fences as wings to funnel cattle into a gate or onto a trailer wings to a gate only act as a bottle neck to crowd animals in and can cause more trouble than they re worth in order to slow them down and stop them walk parallel to or with the animals this will naturally get them to stop or slow down stopping is another part of a training exercise that is important with working cattle they are easier to handle when they and you understand the art and science behind starting and stopping movement it s always important to get the start of movement going before you focus on separating out some select animals from the main group you should have already assessed the group for the ones you want to split from the herd so keep an eye on them and begin to ignore the rest when you walk past these animals they will slow down and stop the ones still ahead of you should continue movement as long as they can see you are still applying pressure and release with your zig zag movements ignore the other animals that want to follow unless one or more of them are a part of the group you want to gather up the other unwanted cattle will soon figure out you do not want them with the group you re herding they will soon stop and go about their own business if you are splitting out just one animal and they are not used to you driving them they may try to stop and challenge you or try to get back to the herd if they are facing you in a challenge just stop and shift your weight from one foot to another to allow them to think if they make a move to go around you step in that direction to discourage that movement repeat until you teach the animal to understand that you mean no harm and you just want them to walk with you yet you are still the boss and are the one responsible for leading or herding them to where they should go this may take a few minutes but take your time and keep watching and reading the animal if they do break away back to the herd then repeat the process again until you are able to successfully drive the cow heifer steer or even bull without them trying to get around or challenge you there is no need to worry if there s one or two extra cattle in with the group that want to stay with the group you can split them off later on when they move from the front of the herd to the back once they get near the back you can adjust your movements so that you are no longer applying pressure for them to stay with the group you ve already collected your zig zag movements will be minimal for a small group or one animal but you are always going to be guiding from the corners and pressuring from the sides this pen will be the first place where your cattle are going to move into and through the handling facility this is a good time for sorting cattle if this needs to be done use the same principles and practices mentioned above for splitting out one or more cattle from the main herd without actively herding them it s important to never push from the back but rather move from the front through the gate from where you want the animals to go when working in a smaller area there is less room for error and less time to react but the basics still apply with controlling movement in this instance you can stand beside the gate or move in towards the back if this is a long pen and move a step forward or backward to stop or encourage movement through the gate the wider the gate though the more in the opening of that gate you will need to stand standing by the gate and moving back and forth or side to side depending on the shape of the pen and where the animals are in that pen will slow down the number of animals that enter the holding alley leading to the next pen you are usually not wanting all animals to go through but only a certain amount out of a larger herd at a time there is almost no need to have someone going in behind the group to push them up that is unless there s a big area behind them where they shouldn t be if there s enough crowding going on that the pressure you apply when at the gate makes them go through that gate then you are only needed at that gate and not needing someone else behind to move them up you only need a group of half a dozen head in a 14 by 20 box or a group of four or five for a 12 crowding tub to work with in a bud box system you only need to be standing right by the opening they re to go through just as with the second step above stepping forward or backward will control movement through to the alley some instances you just need to stand there to encourage them to go by and around you to feel like they re going to go back the way they came in order to get to that point when you step away from the box or tub make a wide loop around then walk straight up the chute towards the tub they will quickly go to the head gate or squeeze chute if you have a calf or cow that gets turned around in the alley then just walk down the alley from the box or tub to get them back into the tub or box repeat your stance by the opening to the alley if the calf balks before the squeeze then once again make a wide loop towards the squeeze or head gate then walk up beside the alley to encourage movement forward repeat the same steps as above for the next group of cattle

your tournament recruit volunteers set tournament rules contact local police and fire departments advertise your tournament call local soccer organizations organize your own teams register teams create a schedule purchase supplies set up the field in advance assign all volunteers a specific duty check in the teams at a designated location you can use a spreadsheet or just make a list that helps you keep track of your tournament expenses you need to have written documentation for your tournament costs so that you can keep your finances organized and easily explain the costs to your funding sources insert all of your figures into a spreadsheet including a contingency fund calculate a total cost for the tournament so that you can plan how to fund it try an excel spreadsheet for easy calculations try google sheets that you can access from any device making it easier to input expenses from your phone you need to have a general idea of how much it will cost to rent fields for your tournament contact your local government schools and athletic clubs to ask about available fields and the rental costs insert the number range on your spreadsheet while you re asking about costs consider getting information about rules and policies your tournament will need trophies so contact local shops that sell them or go online you will need to decide if you want to give participation trophies or just rank trophies estimate the number of trophies by multiplying the projected number of teams by the average number of team members your anticipated number of teams for budget purposes should be the most you can accommodate or the number of teams in your area if you re keeping it local you will need referees concession stand operators security cleaning crew and people to help during game transitions ask other local organizers for rates they pay or go online for a pay range consider asking for volunteers to referee clean up or work the concession stand you may be able to make it a condition for entering the festival that the team provides a certain number of parent volunteers during times the teams are not playing a concession stand can bring in a lot of money for your organization but you need to supply it with snacks and drinks calculate these costs and any related costs such as renting a booth or table remember to ask about permits and codes if you plan to cook food in the concession stand consider ordering pre made food such as pizza and include that expense in your budget sponsors can offset a lot of your costs if you re willing to promote other organizations or events you may even be able to partner with another organization to share the costs and the proceeds make sure that you get any sponsorship deals in writing and fulfill your side of the bargain you may be able to sell advertisements as a form of partnership these ads can be placed on t shirts signs or promotional materials that you use to advertise the tournament consider placing signs around the edges of the field before you can book your venue you ll need to choose a date so that you can make sure that the location you want is available on the day or weekend you plan to host the tournament your tournament should not conflict with other tournaments and it will probably attract more established teams if you choose a date during the normal soccer season in your region you may need to have your tournament over a weekend depending on how many fields you have and how many teams you plan to accommodate make sure that you budget enough time for games your tournament will need to allow for at least one playing field though more fields will allow for more teams to enter refer to the list of fields you called during budgeting to choose the best one call local facilities particularly those that already host soccer games consider how many teams will be playing in your tournament to help you find your field needs you may be able to get the field for free as a sponsorship opportunity for example a local school may allow you to use their field if you promote them as a sponsor your tournament will draw spectators who will want a comfortable means of watching the teams play don t count on your spectators to bring their own seating you need to choose a field that has seating such as stands the field you choose should have nearby bathrooms if you think that you won t have enough bathrooms to accommodate your event consider renting porta potties you may also want to provide changing facilities you will likely need to purchase insurance for your tournament s use of the field so ask the field owner how much insurance you will need to purchase you also need to find out what you need to do to prepare the field and clean it after the tournament choose a name that will attract attention and tell people what kind of tournament it is depending on the size of your area or the type of your organization you may want to include the area s or organization s name in the tournament teams are more likely to want to participate in a tournament that sounds elite or like it s for a good cause so keep that in mind for example if you are raising money for something like a charity or school playground you could call your tournament st marks playground benefit soccer tournament alternatively a tournament in a large area could be called uniting houston soccer tournament if you want to try something fun you could name it just for kicks soccer tournament an elite tournament name could be bay city cup soccer tournament using volunteers will allow you to collect more proceeds since you won t have to hire as much staff contact local colleges and civic organizations to look for volunteers to help with refereeing matches serving concessions picking up trash providing directions to guests monitoring the area reminding people of the rules and other basic duties if you plan to require teams to supply volunteers consider that when recruiting it s better to have too many volunteers than too few don t use volunteers for security unless they work in law enforcement or security instead rent a few security officers by the hour by setting rules you can make sure that you fulfill the obligations that you agreed to when renting the field such as keeping it clean and not destroying the turf you can also set standards for good sportsmanship and protect yourself in case of an incident for example having established rules can allow you to remove someone who is behaving inappropriately example rules include no littering no hitting no profanity no altering of facility property and no food on the field make sure that the authorities know about your tournament in case there s an emergency you can also ask them if they have any recommendations to keep your tournament safe or if there are any laws that you may not be aware of relating to tournaments like yours you may want to hire off duty police officers to serve as your security personnel tell the public about your tournament by posting signs or ads about your tournament ask local clubs and schools if you can include your tournament in their newsletter or if you can post the information in a location where soccer players or coaches will see it be sure to provide details on how to register the teams such as your email contact and telephone number hang fliers in local sporting good stores or near athletic clubs publish ads in the newspaper and on local internet sites go to where the teams are to tell them about your tournament if your area doesn t have a local soccer organization call the local athletic clubs or little league organizations depending on your target age group if your area doesn t have established teams you can still have a tournament if you encourage the community to create their own teams just for your tournament this can work especially well for adults since many adults enjoyed playing sports as youths but no longer get to play on organized teams as adults teams can be built around workplaces churches and social groups have each team provide registration details including the team name a team contact and a roster of players if your tournament is ordering t shirts it s a good idea to have players submit their sizes during registration to make it easier to distribute shirts during the tournament you can register teams by email or via a website that specializes in registrations ask teams to pay all or part of the entry fee at registration so that teams don t back out get a team roster so that you know how many trophies to order get t shirt sizes so that you can create a bundle for each team making it easier to distribute the shirts at check in after registrations are in build a schedule and tournament bracket that allows each team proper play make sure that you have enough time for each game as well as time to clean up between matches when you finalize the schedule make copies so that each team will have access to it on the day or weekend of the tournament wait to buy supplies until after you have an idea about how many teams will participate supplies will include trophies concessions food signs check in materials and t shirts if you have them you may need to order food in advance so contact your supplier to find out what you need to do to be ready on tournament day to be professional your tournament should be ready to go before participants start to arrive go out to the field the day before to make sure that the facility looks good and then get to the field early in the morning to set up the check in table and concessions stands tell your volunteers the exact time that they should arrive so that they don t assume that it s at the start of the tournament otherwise you may be setting up alone your volunteers need to know what their job is and how to properly do it while some can do double duty don t just expect your volunteers to do every job set them times to be on duty and where they should be working for example a volunteer assignment could be 1 pm 3 pm in the concession stand or 8 am 10 am providing directions near the entrance a team representative should be expected to come check in with you or your tournament staff put the check in location in a central area such as near the gates to the field or where most people enter the field from the parking lot provide a copy of the tournament rules the playing schedule and a map to each team representative try using a table or booth to make the check in area more noticeable if your tournament has t shirts you can distribute shirts during check in bundle the shirts by team name and then you can hand each bundle to the team s representative

policy understand failover routing policies design keeping in mind the difficulty of switching understand that route 53 is a key part of a multi region configuration design to avoid being hit with latency based routing failures consider creative fallback approaches powered by route 53 familiarize yourself with shell commands for better debugging identify some online places to resolve dns addresses from multiple locations and report the ip addresses route 53 can be used as an authoritative dns for your domains and subdomains this means that anybody who wants to look up your domain must get it from route 53 either directly or indirectly the ip address that route 53 returns for a domain to a client is computed based on the client s ip address and the route 53 record sets and policies configured by you the routing policy used by route 53 can take into account the health of the endpoints in various ways tcp health checks http status endpoint health checks with string matching route 53 follows a principle of constant work the amount of work done by route 53 is independent of the health of the endpoints being checked this is to avoid the problem of cascading failures introduced by route 53 actions this does not preclude the possibility of route 53 health checks indirectly leading to cascading failures due to traffic redirection however route 53 itself remains robust route 53 record sets have their own time to live ttl that can be set to 60 seconds or more any client or intermediate dns resolver is supposed to respect this ttl if it has not refreshed the resolution of the domain or subdomain for the duration of the ttl or longer then it must refresh the information the shorter the ttl the greater the frequency of route 53 lookups and the greater the cost of using the service in practice these costs are negligible until you get to millions of hits and generally the advantages of shorter ttls overwhelm the disadvantages at this scale because of the speed with which you can make and fix changes to the way global traffic flows it can therefore by used for dynamic and responsive ip addressing route 53 has edge locations around the world it determines availability and latency from each of these edge locations to each of the amazon web services regions in addition route 53 runs each health check independently from each of the edge locations you can view for each health check the history of recent health check activity including both the health checker ip the ip that the health check resolved to and whether the health check was successful when a client does a lookup for a domain or subdomain in route 53 it combines three pieces of information a the client s ip address b the most recent availability latency and health check information and c the record sets and routing policies configured to respond since the health check frequency is 10 30 seconds depending on the setting and the minimum ttl is 60 seconds the minimum time for health check based changes to propagate is 90 150 seconds and the minimum time for other changes to propagate is 60 seconds route 53 is only used by clients to look up ip addresses the actual requests are not routed through route 53 even for ip address lookup not all clients touch route 53 directly there is caching at the level of individual browsers a browser will cache the ip addresses locally for the duration of the ttl there may also be caching at an intermediate level for instance if two different users using the same isp in the same region look up the same address within a time difference of each other that is less than the ttl the second user may get the address cached by the isp s dns resolver from the first user s request rather than going all the way to route 53 the authoritative dns server therefore the count of requests to route 53 does not provide a good estimate of actual traffic to the ip addresses looked up conversely its competitors can be hosted with aws hosted architecture the biggest competitors to route 53 include ultradns dyn cotendo easydns and dns made easy route 53 has approximately comparable availability as competitors but slightly faster propagation latency and slightly lower cost with that said amazon com itself does not use route 53 which might be reason to be a little skeptical about its reliability for very high end deployments route 53 as well as its competitors can be used for servers hosted on amazon infrastructure i e ec2 as well as for servers hosted elsewhere route 53 has better hooks into ec2 for instance it can point to elbs and evaluate their health quickly and so makes particular sense to use when dealing with ec2 it also has good programmatic access and health checks for instance if you want to balance incoming traffic across three servers you can set a route 53 a record with the ip addresses of all the servers you can also set up multiple route 53 a records with different weights using a weighted routing policy discussed later on this page conversely you can use a load balancer to receive incoming traffic and then use that load balancer to forward the traffic to the different servers since traffic does not actually go through any central point route 53 can be used to redistribute traffic across regions without adding round trip time to latency with a load balancer the round trip time between the load balancer and the server that finally processes the request gets added to the end user s latency for instance if we want to make sure that people in europe get served by servers in europe while people in east asia get served by servers in east asia for minimal latency routing traffic through a load balancer defeats the purpose because of the added round trip time however we can use route 53 records for this purpose without adding to latency because the route 53 records are resolved locally without making a trip to a central server moreover due to caching up to the ttl of the lookups even that local resolution has to be done only once a minute route 53 is also correspondingly more robust to downtime because it has a large number of edge locations that respond to requests and has been designed based on the principle of constant work to avoid cascading failure route 53 based routing has the advantage over amazon s elastic load balancers elbs in that it can scale very quickly to large loads whereas elbs cannot handle very rapid and large variations in load quickly enough note that elb is good enough for most use cases but for instance logging company loggly has found that route 53 served its use case better note that loggly is unusual relative to most web or api services that have a more steady or predictable load its reference class is emergency management which combines unpredictability with very quick changes in load at some times route 53 cannot be used to get a bird s eye view of the total traffic route 53 is not good at distributing traffic equally across servers this is because although it allows for a round robin ip lookup strategy this is only for ip lookups and not for the actual requests therefore if the distribution of request sources is not totally uniform then the distribution of traffic can also be corresponding non uniform this is particularly important if you are offering an api service for a small number of clients with high load per client route 53 cannot distribute traffic equitably the way load balancers can for instance amazon s elastic load balancer uses the leastconns algorithm it forwards a request to the server with the least number of outstanding requests this helps reduce traffic load on slower or more unresponsive servers this is not possible in route 53 since traffic does not even flow through it and it has no awareness of the response times of individual servers servers cannot be added to or removed from route 53 as quickly as they can with a load balancer route 53 also cannot be integrated directly into the autoscaling that aws offers though it is possible to write scripts that both create new servers and add records to them using the route 53 api based on the traffic load currently being experienced as logging company loggly has done load balancing is best suited for distributing traffic equitably and maintaining high availability within a region route 53 is best suited for guaranteeing availability across regions minimizing latency and handling cross region redundancy and failover in fact route 53 and amazon cloudfront amazon s cdn like service service share edge locations the goal of a cdn is to directly respond to a query for a typically static resource by serving that resource without hitting the original server or file system that stores the resource the cdn refreshes the resource from the source server or filesystem either periodically or when the resource is explicitly purged the goal of route 53 and other managed dns services is to respond to dns lookup queries only and not to serve actual content you can use a cdn to offer low round trip times around the world to all users bounded by the round trip time to the closest edge location but route 53 does not do this route 53 does not offer this a public hosted zone is a container for all the record sets associated with a web domain and its subdomains each public hosted zone has one ns name server record that specifies the four amazon nameservers to use to resolve the domain and its subdomains this set of four nameservers is called a delegation set to migrate the dns records to amazon route 53 you need to update the list of four nameservers with the registrar where you have registered the domain to this set of four nameservers this list can take 24 48 hours to update globally each public hosted zone also has one soa start of authority record that provides authoritative information about the domain including the primary nameserver the email of the domain administrator the domain serial number and timers related to refreshing the zone the delegation set is generally different for different public hosted zones however it is possible to use the route 53 api to have the same delegation set be used for different public hosted zones this helps make it easy to migrate hosting for a large number of websites since many registrars allow users to specify a default set of nameservers to use across all their domains the individual items in each hosted zone are called record sets these correspond to dns records but with some additional settings each record set has a set of addresses that the subdomain may resolve to these addresses could be ip addresses that may or may not be ec2 instances or dns names such as for an ec2 elb s3 bucket configured as a static site or cloudfront distribution note that when we use dns names the dns name in turn may resolve to one or more ip addresses for instance an ec2 elb will generally resolve to multiple ip addresses with the number of ip addresses depending on the number of availability zones it is operational in as well as the traffic load it is handling each record set is associated with the domain or a subdomain of the domain associated with the hosted zone and plays a role in resolving that domain in general it is possible and crucial to have multiple record sets each of which may in turn have multiple records for a single subdomain each record set has a record type the record types are a subset of the types of dns records the most important record types for ordinary use cases are address records a records and canonical name records cname records the cname makes sense when you are simply rewriting one subdomain to another the a record is much more versatile when using a record that points directly to the ip address of an ec2 instance make sure that the ip address is an elastic ip so that it survives the termination of the instance and can be reattached to a new instance when using an a or cname record for an elastic load balancer cloudfront distribution s3 bucket configured as a static site or route 53 record it is possible to set it as an alias an alias record simply remaps the subdomain to the dns name it is aliased to and therefore changes to the latter are automatically picked by the former this allows a records to have some of the benefits of cname records while still allowing for multiple records per subdomain it also allows for deeper integration with the underlying resources including a direct evaluation of the target health without setting up separate health checks the idea of the alias record was introduced by dnsimple not affiliated with amazon route 53 amazon s implementation differs somewhat from dnsimple s amazon offers a guide on the use of alias versus non alias resource record sets in the case of multiple record sets for a given subdomain and the full picture of how dns lookups for that subdomain will resolve depends on all the record sets and their interaction some types of record sets support health checks and evaluation of target health for any record type alias or not and regardless of record type with a policy other than simple the record types are discussed in the next part you can associate a health check this can ping a specific endpoint with a port you can specify using the http protocol other protocols are not supported and look for a specific search string in the response the request interval can be set to either 10 seconds or 30 seconds the timeout limit for response the length of initial segment of response that will be matched against the search string and the fraction of health checks that need to pass for the endpoint to be considered healthy are all controlled by amazon and not user configurable the evaluate target health option is available for alias records cname or a records regardless of the policy since this option is offered only for specific amazon resources it can benefit from deep integration with the underlying resources for instance in the special case of alias records cname or a records that point to amazon ec2 elbs the target health evaluation passes if and only if the elb has at least one instance that is registered and in service this is a special behind the scenes deep integration between the two aws services route 53 and elb the simplest routing policy is a simple routing policy this is for cases where there is only one record set associated with the subdomain a simple routing policy can include multiple ip or dns addresses and will resolve to each of them an equal fraction of the time specifically it follows a round robin strategy simple routing policies pair well with cname records as always use an alias record if pointing to an ec2 dns address such as an elastic load balancer and evaluate the target health another commonly used routing policy is a weighted routing policy here each record set associated with a subdomain gets a weight within the record set all individual ip addresses are resolved using a round robin strategy across the record sets the probability of a given record set being used is the ratio of the weight of the record set to the sum of weights of all record sets for the subdomain for instance if there are record sets of weights 3 2 2 and 1 respectively for a subdomain they are selected with probabilities of 3 8 2 8 2 8 and 1 8 respectively weighted routing policies make sense only in case of multiple record sets all using the weighted routing policy typically for a weighted routing policy we only specify one ip address or dns a record per record set and therefore create as many record sets as the number of ip addresses or dns a records note that the numerical weight associated with a record set in a weighted routing policy does not give a full picture of the probability of that record set being used we also need to know the denominator the sum of weights across all record sets in particular if we add a new record set the probability of resolving to each of the other record sets goes down in the same proportion similarly if the weight on one of the record sets is altered this affects the probability for all the other record sets latency based routing lbr is one of the more sophisticated routing policies each latency record specifies an amazon web services region the latency based router when asked to resolve the subdomain looks at its periodically refreshed table of the latency between the following areas its edge location closest to the ip address doing the lookup and the amazon web services region specified in the record set note that it is not logically entailed that the records in the record set are located in the aws region specified for latency based routing in fact your records may not be on aws infrastructure at all if they are on aws infrastructure it makes sense to use the aws region they are in otherwise it makes sense to use the closest aws region to offer the best proxy for latency to those records similar to the case of weighted records latency based record sets make sense only when there is more than one of them in this case the latency for each record set is calculated as explained above by a table lookup of latency between the closest edge location to the requester and the aws region specified in the record set then the record set with the lowest reported latency is returned note in particular that this estimate of latency may be very different from the actual latency of queries for two reasons it uses latency from edge locations to the aws region rather than from the actual client to the actual server and second it ignores the processing time on the servers itself which could vary between regions in particular unlike the leastconns load balancer used by amazon s elbs that adaptively redistributes traffic based on latency differences route 53 does not take into account any information about actual query latency we might ideally imagine that if one region is slower than another the other region will pick up a larger share of traffic from geographical locations somewhere in the middle of the two latency based routing does not do this the latency based routing algorithm has been known to fail in that it sometimes routes traffic to an incorrect location therefore if latency is truly important to you and you have a small set of customers who heavily use your api it s better to give them subdomains that directly resolve to particular regions rather than use lbr hoping that they will be routed correctly this is similar to latency based routing but allows explicit specification of what geographical locations should get mapped to what record sets aws route 53 offers both active and passive failover based on health checks and direct evaluation of target health all of which operate on the principle of constant work to avoid cascading failure if you associate health checks with your route 53 record sets then a particular record set is taken out of commission after failing three successive health checks the number of failures may be configurable similarly if you are evaluating target health of the elb a record set is taken out of commission once the target proves unhealthy the record sets come back live once the health check or target health return to normal the maximum time for the effect to be global is 150 seconds 3 30 second failed checks plus 60 second ttl note that the ttl is configurable and if you set it to longer then it will take more time for the change to propagate for weighted routing policies this means that the weights on the still healthy record sets increase proportionately for latency based routing policies this means that if a record set goes down entirely all the traffic that would have been routed there is instead routed to the next lowest latency region for that particular part of traffic therefore the load for the other regions will not increase in the same proportion but rather it will increase based on their proximity to the traffic that was served by the now down region this can lead to a cascading failure for instance say you have three regions us west 1 us east 1 and eu west 1 with one record set for each and you have configured capacity to handle typical traffic loads for each region now suppose us east 1 goes down in this case almost all the traffic for us east 1 will go to us west 1 the closest region for most of the traffic that would go to us east 1 this could be a significant traffic increase for us west 1 and the increased load could cause the region to collapse now all global traffic hits eu west 1 which might cause that region to collapse the upshot is that passive failover can actually cause a global collapse without careful design the problem is more acute than with weighted routing policies because of how a lot of the rerouted traffic goes to one region it is also possible to have record sets explicitly designated as failover these record sets are used only if all the other record sets go out of commission we can use these to serve static backups it can be hard to switch record type aliasing and routing policies in the route 53 console for instance there are constraints on the record sets for a particular subdomain we cannot mix weighted and latency based records and we cannot have more than one simple record one way out of this challenge is to start with a tree structure of records to begin with allowing for the creation of a new branch of the tree amazon offers guides on complex dns configuration using the route 53 api gives more flexibility with making changes than using the console since more complex changes can be made more quickly minimizing downtime during tricky changes between configurations invest at least a few hours in making sure that your route 53 policies are set reasonably investigate the use of traffic policies and traffic flow that allow you to store complex configurations in the long run clicking around in the console to modify policies is not a good idea for a key ingredient to your availability investigate incorporating updates to the route 53 api in your deployment scripts such as ansible or chef scripts as mentioned earlier if latency is particularly important for a customer or if for some other reason you want a particular customer to only hit your api endpoint in a particular region it is better to give them a subdomain for which you have configured records only for that region rather than rely on latency based or geolocation based routing these don t usually fail but when they do you are helpless one often underappreciated aspect of latency based routing is that you can use it to route traffic to a region that is not the closest region one way you can use this is as follows suppose you have two chances to query the backend server most of the times the server responds correctly in the first chance however if it fails this could be due to region specific issues such as servers in the region being overloaded or connectivity problems with the region you therefore want the first query to be to the geographically closest region but the second query to be to a different region that is not geographically closest but hopefully second closest you can do this by having two subdomains one for your first choice and one for your second choice the route 53 records for the first subdomain simply use latency based routing as defined by default i e you create one record set for this subdomain and each active region routing traffic closest to that region to the servers in that region the route 53 records for the second subdomain use latency based routing but send traffic closest to one region to a different region this guarantees that your two chances are used up against different regions note that this is not a substitute for health checks and target health evaluations but it does address cases where a region is somewhat overloaded but still largely healthy it also avoids the problem of cascading failure where a region with a high failure rate may end up getting additional traffic due to second tries whois can look up authoritative registration information for domains nslookup can be used to get information about the nameservers dig the most useful command for route 53 debugging can find the ip addresses associated with a given subdomain and you can verify that the results returned conform with your routing policy it also prints the remaining ttl when you issue the first command this should be your full ttl subsequent invocations within the ttl should show the remaining ttl for instance if your ttl is 60 seconds then running dig after 15 seconds should show a ttl of 45 seconds if dns name a has latency based alias records pointing to dns name b and dns name c you can dig all three names and then see if the ip addresses that a resolves to matches the ip addresses that b and c resolve to you can also specify a trace option to dig to print the trace traceroute is also useful to get clearer information on how the resolution occurred ping can be used to query the dns address and get estimates of the round trip time curl or wget can be used to make a http request and get a response you may run these shell commands from your own machine or by logging in to remote servers in various locations some examples are whatsmydns netand check host net 
query	119	sue your insurance company sometimes insurance companies do not act in the most upstanding manner if you have an insurance policy in place an event happens giving rise to a claim on that policy and the insurance company does not act as it is supposed to by denying your claim delaying payment paying you less than you are owed etc you may have to resort to litigation to get the money you deserve understanding on what grounds you can sue and the process for bringing the suit itself will help you if you find yourself in this frustrating situation understanding when you can sue your insurance company suing your insurance company taking your insurance company to court sue your insurance company if it unreasonably delays payment of your claim sue your insurance company if it tries to settle your claim for an unreasonably low amount of money sue your insurance company if it unreasonably denies your claim sue your insurance company for post claim underwriting sue your insurance company for failing to defend you in court understand your causes of action against your insurance company generally contact your insurance company obtain a copy of your signed insurance policy read your insurance policy thoroughly make sure your loss is covered under the terms of the contract compile an estimate of your losses research the insurance law of your state file a claim with your state s department of insurance hire an attorney file a complaint with the appropriate court engage in discovery participate in the pre trial conference go to trial insurance companies are in the business of making money the longer an insurance company takes to pay a claim 1 the longer it can hold on to the money it owes you and use that money for its own purposes and 2 you might find yourself in a position where you really need the money and therefore become willing to settle for less than the amount they should have paid you insurance companies are obligated to pay valid insurance claims in a timely manner if your insurance company has unreasonably delayed payment of your claim you can sue it in order to force it to pay the amount it owes you make sure to ask your insurance company for the reason it is delaying payment of your claim and ask them to put this reason into writing and send it to you you will need this as evidence later on once you make a claim you and your insurance company will engage in a negotiation process where the insurance company tries to talk you down from the amount you request to cover your losses while you may be able to reach an amount both of you agree on sometimes your insurance company will refuse to offer you anything but a small amount of money i e not enough to cover your loss and hope that you will take it instead of trying to fight the company over the amount if this is the case you can sue the insurance company because it is unwilling to cover your losses in a reasonable manner make sure to ask your claims adjuster for the reason the insurance company is only willing to pay you such a low amount and get this reason in writing you will need this later there are many tactics your insurance company might use in order to not pay your claim and many reasons it might give you for denying payment it might say that it was your fault you suffered a loss that your particular policy doesn t cover the exact circumstances of your loss that you didn t do enough to prevent the loss or simply that your claim is too high regardless of the reason it gives you if you feel that the reason it is denying your claim doesn t seem fair or that it is not rational you can sue your insurance company for denying your claim without a good justification for doing so make sure to have your insurance company give you the reason it is denying your claim in writing so you will have this for reference later on before an insurance company issues you a policy it engages in a process called underwriting by which it investigates you and your history to determine if it should offer you an insurance policy sometimes insurance companies will refuse to pay your claim on the basis that your policy should never have been issued in the first place because you were too great a risk to insure basically trying to underwrite you again after you suffer a loss making you a greater risk to the insurance company in order to avoid having to pay you it will then try to cancel your policy and use this as a basis for not paying an otherwise covered claim if your insurance company does this you can sue them because this type of behavior is not legitimate to recognize this type of behavior check to see which part of the insurance company is processing your claim the claims department or the underwriting department if it is the latter be on the lookout for your insurance company taking this type of action against you if your insurance company issues you a check refunding your premium payments because they are canceling your insurance do not cash this check doing so may be seen as accepting the insurance company s decision to cancel your insurance in light of a claim it does not want to pay in the liability portion of your insurance policy your insurance company protects you from certain damages sought in lawsuits against you this promise is often referred to as an insurance company s duty to defend when an insurance company has a duty to defend they will be required to hire legal counsel to represent you in covered claims it also includes a promise to cover all legal fees and costs if the damages being sought are at all covered by your insurance policy your insurance company will have this duty to defend if your insurance company fails to defend you when they were supposed to you may sue for bad faith and recoup the costs of defending yourself these costs could include attorneys fees for both defending yourself and suing the insurance company in law the cause of action is the formal way of stating that you have the right to file a lawsuit in light of a particular series of events in relation to insurance companies you will generally be bringing a lawsuit under one of three causes of action 1 breach of contract 2 violation of a consumer protection law or 3 a violation of bad faith law the above are examples of bad faith on the part of your insurance company which basically means that it did something wrong without any good reason for doing so if your insurance company has engaged in any of these activities this is the legal reason you will point to for bringing your lawsuit against your insurance company the majority of lawsuits against insurance companies are for these types of bad faith violations many of the above activities could also be considered a breach of contract meaning your insurance company has violated the terms of the insurance policy it offered you and on which you have been paying premiums these activities may also be considered a violation of federal or state consumer protection law which prevents businesses from engaging in unfair or deceptive business practices or from making fraudulent statements these laws vary by state but generally if your insurance company has made false statements to justify any of its actions you can bring your lawsuit on this ground as well your first step should always be to contact your insurance company to try to resolve your dispute before threatening litigation contact your insurance company and talk with your insurance agent to see if you can work the issue out on your own if your particular insurance agent or claims adjuster is unhelpful ask to speak to their supervisor ask why your claim was denied and get the reason in writing you will need this as evidence later if you intend to sue your insurance company you should have a copy of the insurance policy in question filed in your records with your other important documents if you do not have a copy or have somehow misplaced or lost it contact your insurance provider and request a copy of your insurance policy this is very important if you will be suing your insurance company because they violated the terms of your policy it is crucial that you understand exactly what your policy says pay particular attention to things like the proper process for submitting a claim how payment is handled and how disputes are resolved according the the contract make sure you have complied with your contractual obligations if you will be asserting that your insurance company has failed to follow through with its contractual duties you will want to be sure that they cannot make the same claim against you if your policy states the process by which you must submit a claim for example follow this process exactly insurance contracts are generally very specific about what is and is not covered as you are reading through your policy check to see if the facts surrounding your loss match with the types of loss your insurance company has contractually agreed to cover in your policy depending on the type of insurance you are dealing with you will want to make sure that you have evidence substantiating your claim acquire the necessary records bills receipts or photographs you will need to show you have a valid claim if you have spoken with your insurance company about your claim collect the records of these conversations written correspondence e mails etc so that you will be able to show you have taken steps to resolve your claim before resorting to litigation insurance law varies widely state to state and you will want to be sure that you are aware of what your state s laws say in relation to insurance claims before engaging in litigation there are many resources online dedicated to helping you understand the insurance laws of your state of residence read your state s laws thoroughly to get an understanding of the laws that will govern your lawsuit every state has a department dedicated to assisting consumers with regards to insurance claims and each has a website you can visit for more information or to file a complaint online after filing your claim you will need to provide whatever documents or evidence your state s insurance department may ask for the website for your state s department of insurance will also contain resources to help you understand your state s insurance law you should be aware that most state s insurance departments receive many claims each day and therefore you may have to wait a considerable amount of time before your dispute is finally resolved if you want quicker results consider hiring an attorney if you do hire an attorney some states insurance departments will wait until your attorney has litigated your case before intervening insurance law is very complicated and you might not have the easiest time researching and understanding it on your own you also might be too busy to sit down for hours to read through long lists of statutes while your state s department of insurance will certainly help you the fastest way to get your claim resolved is to hire a local attorney specializing in insurance law attorneys often accept insurance cases on a contingency fee basis meaning they will take a portion of the money you are awarded if you win as payment instead of you paying them up front you will be charged nothing if you lose your case the attorney will also be able to sit down with you and discuss the issues of your particular case to determine the best way to handle your denied claim many attorneys offer free consultation so don t be afraid to take advantage of this and talk through the facts of your case with someone who specializes in your state s insurance laws your attorney will take care of the lawsuit as it progresses and will contact you as needed for more information the first step of any lawsuit is filing a complaint with the appropriate court since insurance law is based mostly on state law it is likely you will be in the state trial court for the county in which you live your attorney will submit a document to the court stating your case in broad terms the basic facts surrounding the dispute and your cause of action for bringing the lawsuit which will probably be bad faith on the part of the insurance company your insurance company will file an answer to this complaint and your attorney will receive a copy from this document you will be able to get a general idea of what your insurance company s position is after your complaint is filed and the insurance company has responded the process known as discovery will begin basically this process which happens before trial allows each side to get a sense of the strengths and weaknesses of each side s case to determine if the case should be settled or if it would be better to go to trial and argue in front of a judge and jury this is where your written correspondence with the insurance company will come in handy if you don t have certain information about your case that you think the insurance company has in its records this is the time to ask for this information the insurance company will also ask you for certain records and documents which you must produce during this process the insurance company might depose you which means that it meets with you and your lawyer in an official setting to ask you questions pertaining to your case most cases are settled in this stage if you have a valid claim and your insurance company sees that you are willing to take legal action to protect your interests it will likely offer to settle your case with you to save itself the expense of trial if the discovery process has concluded and no settlement has been reached you your lawyer the insurance company and its lawyers will all meet before a judge to discuss certain issues before the trial begins that will speed up the trial process going forward these will be things like the rules for admitting certain types of evidence which issues the parties agree upon and the like on the day your case is set for trial you your attorney your insurance company and its attorneys will appear in court to argue your case your attorney will present the facts of your case against the insurance company and the insurance company will try to argue why it has not broken the law you will probably be called on to testify at trial so be sure to be consistent with the facts of your case tell the truth and remain calm and relaxed going to trial can be a stressful process but if you have a valid claim and the documentation to back it up you will likely receive a verdict in your favor 
query	120	file for a travel visa a person who wishes to enter a foreign country must normally apply for a travel visa in order to enter that foreign country legally a travel visa is a document issued by the consulate or embassy of the foreign country to which you intend to travel travel visas may be divided into the two categories of 1 immigrant or settlement visas and 2 visitor or nonimmigrant visas 1 visas in the first category are for individuals who intend to settle in the foreign country as an immigrant while visas in the second category are fixed term visas intended for holidays work study and other temporary or fixed term visits whether or not you need a visa to travel to a foreign country depends on whether that foreign country requires a visa for a person that holds the citizenship or nationality that you hold countries often do not require visas for persons of certain nationalities visiting temporarily or settling permanently learning how to file for a travel visa requires determining what type of visa you require and filing the appropriate paperwork for that type of visa with the relevant embassy or consulate finding out what visa category applies to you filing for a travel visa consider the purpose of your travel find out if you need a visa for a holiday consider whether you need a visa to study abroad consider whether an overseas job requires a work permit determine whether you will require a transit visa determine what type of settlement or immigrant visa you require locate a visa wizard online determine what type of visa you need fill out an application gather supporting documentation submit your application and supporting documents attend an interview if required appeal the decision why are you traveling to the foreign country in question knowing the purpose of your travel is very important because if you know your purpose of travel you will be able to determine what visa category applies to you and will therefore be able to file for the correct visa equally important is knowing that you should never try to file for a visa category that does not match the purpose of your travel e g do not file for a visitor visa if you are intending to travel for work or study are you visiting a foreign country for a holiday if yes then you need a visitor visa a limited term non immigrant visa unless the country to which you are travelling does not require a tourist visa for persons who hold your nationality e g americans traveling for tourism do not need a visitor visa to travel to finland for stays under 90 daysor to travel to canada for stays under 180 days are you traveling to a foreign country to study if yes then you need a student visa unless the country to which you are traveling does not require student visas of persons who hold your nationality for example if you hold the nationality of a country that is a member of the european union then you do not need a student visa to study in another member state of the european union on the other hand if you hold an american passport and wish to study in the united kingdom for a period greater than 6 months you do need a student visa did you just get a job in a foreign country if yes then you need a work visa unless the country to which you are traveling does not require work visas of persons holding your nationality e g if you are a citizen of a european union member state you may work in another member state without a work visa on the other hand if you are an american citizen wishing to work in for example belgium you will need a work visa also known as a work permit will you only be spending a very short period of time in country a en route to country b if so then you will need what is known as a transit visa unless country a does not require a transit visa for persons holding the nationality that you hold and you meet certain requirements for example if you hold american citizenship and therefore an american passport you can transit through australia without a transit visa if you enter australia by aircraft hold a confirmed onward booking to leave australia within 8 hours of arrival by the same or another aircraft you do not leave the

take feedback gracefully continue your professional training love the work that you do it s important to get your resume in the best shape possible before you begin your job search you need to state all of your relevant work experience use active verbs to explain the work you ve done and make your resume easy to read and understand most importantly you have to make sure to proofread it several times before showing it to anyone keep in mind that you may need to create more than one resume in order to tailor your experience to the position if you re applying to both a job as a library assistant and a teacher for example then you may need two resumes that highlight different strengths make sure your resume is easy to read and that it s obvious where you worked what your position was and how long you worked there some positions will ask you to list your references right on your resume prepare to have at least 2 3 people who can vouch for you before you begin the job hunt have a friend or a professional in your field look over your resume to give suggestions for how to make it more readable size 11 font has been shown to be the most appealing font to employers you can try

internship even if you re only doing it a few hours a week though the work won t be paid most likely it s a great way to get your foot in the door and to gain the skills you need to get an impressive resume there are also many opportunities to learn skills online for example if you re applying for editing jobs and notice that many of them prefer a candidate who knows basic html find an online class that can help you master this skill talk to people in the field that you want to enter they can help you get a sense of the skills you should possess before you start looking for a job some studies show that up to 70 80 of jobs are found through networking not through the traditional job application process if you want to dramatically increase your chances of getting a job then you have to try to network with professionals in your field as well as with people you know as much as you can though this may feel like you re cheating think of it as giving yourself the edge you need to succeed it makes sense that it s much easier to get a job through networking employers want to hire someone who can be vouched for instead of facing a pile of anonymous resumes it makes their job much easier you may not think that you know anyone who can help you get a job however even if your friends or family members don t directly have a connection to anyone in your field you should tell them that you re starting your job hunt to see if they know someone who knows someone who can be an asset to you if you ve gone to college and your school has regular networking events in the area try attending a few to see who you can meet make sure you prepare your elevator pitch before you go to these events so you can comfortably tell people who you are and what you re looking for when they ask you to tell them a little bit about yourself once you have your resume up to date have tried your hand at networking and have an idea of what you re looking for then you can begin your job search check out all of the different job searching sites on the internet and look for positions that sound perfect for you you should pick jobs that you feel fairly qualified for though you can go out on a limb and apply for a job that may ask for a bit more experience than you have if you feel like you can make up for it in other ways remember that it s important to apply to a job while it s hot or recently posted the most activity around a job posting happens in the first three days so if you find a job that sounds absolutely perfect for you try to apply for as soon as you can instead of putting it off until the weekend some popular sites for looking for jobs are indeed com simplyhired com monster com or even craigslist com you can also look for job search sites that are more relevant for your field for example if you re looking to get a job at a startup then you can try sites like ventureloop com once you ve found a job you want to apply to you should take the time to write a concise eye catching cover letter that shows why you re perfect for the job if you really want to succeed then yes you should individualize each cover letter to the job you re applying for this shows employers that you take the job seriously and that you really want to be a part of their team if you can find the name of the hiring manager or the person in charge of your application then addressing your cover letter to this person shows that you really care use engaging language instead of saying i believe i am a strong candidate for the job say something more exciting like i would love to bring my enthusiasm and experience to your team make sure to address the qualifications and qualities the company is looking for and to show how you possess them and how you would succeed in the position don t just regurgitate your resume give them more details about work you ve done or interests you have that they can t find out about through your resume alone keep it short and sweet just two paragraphs talking about who you are and why you d be a good fit for the company and one paragraph saying where you can be reached and that you would look forward to an interview will be just fine keep your language professional and appropriate to the company if the company is a serious business then you shouldn t try to use casual jokey language however if you re applying to write for an online humor journal you can be a bit more creative in your word choice once you ve found a few jobs to apply for go ahead and send in your resume and cover letter and hope for the best if you want to take initiative you can send a follow up email to make sure the hiring manager got your materials after a week or so to show that you really care if you re really serious about the job search then you should aim to apply to at least a few positions each week as long as they sound relatively appealing some companies can take months to get back to you so it s best to keep your options open and to cast a wide net as you apply to more and more positions it will become easier because it won t be as hard to tailor your cover letter to each job the fact of the matter is the job search process is an arduous one and it can take several months or even longer to find a job that suits you the average person applies to over 60 jobs before finding that perfect fit so you shouldn t feel discouraged if you apply to 30 or 40 jobs and don t hear a peep back this is a reflection of the market and the fact that many jobs are posted but given to internal hires or people who get them through networking don t think that this means you ll never find a job and continue your search though this will take up a lot of your time and may be draining imagine how good you ll feel when you finally land that perfect job after so much hard work don t let the job search affect your mental state many people get really discouraged by the whole process but you can t let it get you down rest assured that if you work hard enough you are bound to succeed continue to network as you search for jobs the traditional way you never know what you may turn up if you ve landed an interview then the most important thing you can do in advance is to prepare as much as you can for your big day you want to read up on the company understand what the position truly entails practice answering relevant interview questions for your field and make sure you have plenty of specific examples to illustrate how you have the qualities your employers are looking for you ll probably be asked about your biggest strengths make sure you re prepared with specific examples of why you possess these strengths and make sure that they are skills that your interviewers are looking for for the position you may be asked about your weaknesses or areas of improvement don t say that your biggest weakness is that you work too hard they ve all heard that before instead you should mention a weakness that isn t that bad and which isn t crucial to the position and also mention steps you re taking to improve that weakness you will likely be asked why you re a good fit for the company make sure you understand the company s mission and goals and talk about any relevant things about the company such as the workplace culture that make you a good fit for the team prepare to answer behavioral questions too such as what would you do if a manager was out of line or how would you control a classroom with several rowdy students the worst thing you can do is to roll in to an interview late this shows that you really don t care about the job aim to get there at least half an hour early and then walk in to the building 5 10 minutes early this shows that you have your act together without you being so early that your interviewers are annoyed or thrown off use this time to get yourself in a calm and positive state instead of reviewing your answers bring a copy of your resume and cover letter with you along with any other relevant materials you may need to bring this can help you answer your questions and can show that you ve put thought into your interview obviously dressing professionally and looking your best is a must when it comes to an interview even if the environment at the job you re applying for is a bit more casual you should err on the side of being overdressed than looking overly casual in a more professional setting wear well fitting neat and appropriate clothing and make sure you re well groomed and look put together for the interview looking professional will not only show your employers that you take your job seriously but it will also give you more confidence as you go through your interview it s important to be confident well spoken and articulate as you answer your interview questions speak clearly and slowly enough to be understood look your interviewers in the eye and know that it s okay to take a minute to form your response instead of blurting out your answers before you re ready make sure to answer the questions confidently without coming off as arrogant and be comfortable asking for clarification when it s necessary when you speak make sure to keep your posture solid and keep your hands on your lap avoid fidgeting or staring at the floor this can help you sound confident at the end of most interviews employers ask if you have any questions for them you should remember that the interview really works both ways and that it s up to you to see if the job is a good fit for you as well prepare a few questions to show that you really care about the position and want to be as involved as you can if you say that you have absolutely no questions this can indicate that you haven t really done your research you can ask things like how would you describe the office culture at your company or will there be opportunities to collaborate with other employees or i read about the name here project online i was wondering if you could tell me more about it if the interviewers truly did answer all of your questions you can say i was going to ask more about mention the aspect of the job here but you ve already covered that there are a few no nos when it comes to interviewing successfully though you should focus on the positive aspects of interviewing you should make an effort not to do a few things that show employers that you re not really all that serious about your job here are a few things you want to try to avoid when it comes to interviewing avoid asking about perks before you ve gotten the job if you re already asking about vacation days and bonuses before you ve been hired it ll show that you care more about what comes with the job than the job itself don t bring your coffee into the interview with you this shows that you re taking too much of a casual approach to the interview if they ask why you left or want to leave your current position avoid bad mouthing your previous employer even if your old or current boss is a real jerk you should never say this say something like i ve gained a ton of valuable experience at my current job but i m ready for a new challenge don t mention that you ve applied to 80 other jobs without getting an interview you want your employers to feel like the position they are hiring for is your 1 choice the most important way to make sure you keep your job is to have a strong relationship with your boss you don t need to be best friends with your boss but you should have a friendly relationship that is based on mutual respect and strong communication though each boss has his or her own style you should make sure to be friendly with your boss and receptive to what he or she has to say and to show that you really care about him or her though some bosses are much more private about their personal lives than others if your boss is open about his interests or his family then you can take the time to ask him about it when you re making small talk if you have issues with your job take it up with your boss respectfully don t complain to your coworkers instead or you risk having that get back to you when your other co workers gossip about your boss try to remove yourself from the situation another way to make sure you to keep your job is to show that you can play well with others if you want to seem like an important part of your company then you should be friendly with your co workers receptive to their ideas and willing to openly collaborate and communicate with the people you work with even if you disagree occasionally you should do so respectfully so that you seem like you can get along with anyone if you have a reputation for not being able to get along with other co workers then your boss will see that it s hard to fit you into a team however if you re the one making people laugh and feel good at the office it ll be hard to picture the office without you make an effort to attend office activities after work such as happy hours volunteering events or team building activities though you don t have to attend every event you should make an effort to show that you do care about your co workers outside the office steer clear of office gossip you don t want to get a reputation for talking about people behind their backs one way to make sure you keep your job is to try to maintain a positive attitude around the office as much as you can talk about the things you love about your job instead of complaining about the things you don t like and make an effort to make other people smile and to avoid whining about the small details you re not so thrilled about get a reputation for always having a smile on your face and it ll be much more likely that you ll keep your job of course if something really upsets you at the office you should have a respectful conversation with your boss about it you don t need to fake it if you really feel like something isn t right try to laugh or be cheerful as much as you can you want people to feel like they are gaining energy from your presence not being drained by you if you want to keep your job then you should make sure to be eager and excited about whatever challenges come your way you don t want to look like you don t want to do anything beyond your job description if your boss asks you to take on an extra project or to try something new you should accept it and be excited about all of the new things you will learn if you continue to challenge yourself not only will you impress your boss but you will also make your job much more fun and rewarding you want to be known as the person who will be happy to take on extra work or to learn something new you should be the first person your boss thinks of when it s time to tackle a new project showing up to work on time or even a little early may not sound like a huge deal but it s actually an important way to show your boss and everyone in the company how much your work means to you make an effort to show up at least 15 20 minutes early each day so you ll at least be there on time if you run into an unexpected delay plus if you get there a little early you can get a head start on your day if you do show up late make sure to apologize and show that you know this is not acceptable you don t want to seem smug about it make sure to be punctual to all meetings as well you should make a sincere effort to be neat and organized in all of the work that you do make sure your computer files and all of the files of your desk are in order that your appointment calendar is up to date and that you have a to do list that is easy to accomplish and easy to read if you spend just 10 minutes a day cleaning up your workspace and organizing your files you should be in great shape being organized is another sign of somebody who really takes his or her work seriously if your boss asks you to send him a file and it takes you an hour to find it then this shows that you don t really value your work if you want to show that you take your job seriously then you have to show up to the office looking professional though some offices are more casual than others you have to adhere to the dress code and show that you re really determined to make a good impression plus you will feel more professional if you look more professional and having a disheveled appearance will make it look like you really don t want to put in the effort if you care for your appearance then your boss your clients and your customers will take you more seriously another way to make sure you keep your job is to be creative and innovative in your position and to always look out for new ways to do things you don t want your boss to think that you re set in your ways and that you re not ready for the next challenge that your job will bring technology and the work many people do is rapidly changing and you have to be ready to roll with the punches and even ready to propose ideas for how to do your work more efficiently be eager to suggest new ways of doing things to your boss and to show him or her that you re always thinking outside the box if you want to keep your job then you have to be able to take feedback well and to understand that constructive feedback is meant to make you do better at your job not to make you feel inadequate in some way you should be respectful and thankful when your boss takes the time to give you feedback and use it to improve what you do on a daily basis if you re mean or unreceptive to feedback then your boss will see that you re not willing to improve at your job of course not every drop of feedback may always be helpful to you still you should be kind and gracious when you receive it show that you want to go above and beyond by continuing your professional training even after you ve landed your job take night classes get a part time master s degree attend conferences read relevant journals in your field talk to experts and just do whatever it is you want to do in order to stay up to date about the innovations in your field and to do the best work that you can if your boss knows that you re continuing your professional training then he ll see that you re really committed to excelling in your field and taking your job to the next level honestly when it comes down to it the best thing you can do to keep your job is to truly love all of the work that you do if you feel like you re faking it at work or pretending to be interested in most of the things you do then it may be time to find a position that is better suited to your interests if you find something that truly suits you then you ll feel like you never have to work a day in your life if you really love your work then you won t have to make an effort to be positive to advance in your field and to find new ways to succeed at what you do every single day 
query	123	find a lawyer in a mistaken identity case mistaken identity is a defense to a criminal charge and to some debt collection lawsuits in the criminal context you essentially argue that a crime might have been committed but you were wrongly identified as the suspect in a debt collection lawsuit you argue that the debt belongs to someone with a name or identifying information that is similar to yours 1 you will definitely need a lawyer to help you build a mistaken identity defense however one lawyer will not be able to cover both types of cases you will need a criminal defense lawyer if you are dealing with criminal charges and you will need a consumer lawyer if you are dealing with debt collectors to find a lawyer who can help you should get referrals and then schedule consultations finding a criminal lawyer finding a consumer lawyer figure out if you need a criminal defense lawyer talk to a public defender talk to friends and family ask other lawyers for a referral use your state bar s lawyer referral service set up initial consultations gather helpful documents prior to your meeting arrive early discuss how the lawyer will handle your case ask about fees compare lawyers make a decision determine your need for a consumer lawyer create a list of possible lawyers in your area narrow your list so it includes only the most qualified lawyers in your price range examine each lawyer s background make appointments meet with the lawyer bring important documents evaluate the individual lawyer as well as their team ask about fees and expenses make comparisons hire the best fit if you are being investigated for a crime or if you have been charged with one you need to seek immediate assistance from a qualified criminal defense lawyer do not talk to law enforcement or anyone else until you hire someone a criminal defense lawyer will be able to navigate the legal process and help you make your mistaken identity defense you may not know that you are being investigated for a crime until you hear that your friends and family are being interviewed by law enforcement in addition if law enforcement comes to ask you questions do not answer and tell them you would like to speak with a lawyer before continuing if you have been charged with a crime you will know at that point you will have most likely been arrested and or cited you are entitled to legal help if you are facing time in jail accordingly states must offer you a public defender in a criminal case you should ask the judge for a public defender when you attend your first court hearing to qualify for a public defender you must be low income you will have to fill out an application reporting your finances you don t really get to choose your public defender instead someone will be assigned to you if you don t get along with your public defender then you can complain to the defender s office however because public defenders are so busy you might not get another one assigned to your case if you think you have the funds or property available to hire a criminal defense lawyer start by asking friends and family for recommendations you will often know someone who has a friend that practices law in addition your friends and family may be able to ask around the community these types of connections can help you find a trusted lawyer in the community most lawyers rely on these recommendations for business therefore if someone likes a lawyer enough to recommend them they are probably a good candidate in some circumstances your friends and family may know lawyers but not any criminal defense lawyers if this happens ask for the general lawyer s contact information reach out to them and ask if they can make any referrals to a criminal defense lawyer these referrals are priceless and can help you get a meeting with a quality lawyer the legal community is small and tight knit lawyers will usually know someone they trust that practices in the area where you need help if you are not having luck getting recommendations or referrals use the free services offered by your state s bar association in every state the bar association runs a lawyer referral service which people can use to find qualified legal help after answering a few general questions about your legal problem you will be put in contact with various qualified lawyers in your area once you have a list of three or four choices contact them and set up a time to meet these initial consultations give both you and the lawyer a chance to feel out the possible relationship the lawyer will assess your legal case and their ability to help in some way you will use the meeting to assess your ability to work with the lawyer or an extended period of time when you set up the initial consultations make sure you ask about fees some lawyers will offer you a chance to talk for free while others may charge a small fee for your consultation the lawyer might want to see documents related to your case you should be told what documents to find when you schedule your consultation for example you might need a copy of any police reporta copy of the criminal complaint against youa written narrative of what you remember about the night in question lawyers are busy so you should do everything possible to get to the office on time call if you are going to be late tell the secretary when you think you will arrive in some circumstances the lawyer may have to reschedule when you arrive check in and wait for the lawyer to get you make sure you bring all of your documents with you at the consultation the lawyer will ask that you describe your case there should also be time for you to ask questions write down the questions ahead of time one thing you want to know is how the attorney will handle your mistaken identity defense ask what witnesses or information you will need for your defense have the lawyer tell you how often they have raised the mistaken identity defense once multiple times also ask how well it has worked did the lawyer s client win using a mistaken identity defense ask what other defenses you might have have the lawyer explain the likely outcome of your case you shouldn t leave the lawyer s office without knowing how they will charge you generally criminal defense lawyers charge clients by the hour or by using a fixed fee with that said lawyers have the flexibility to charge you in any number of ways the method they choose will depend on their preference and your ability to pay for example if a lawyer charges an hourly fee it will usually be between 125 and 400 per hour in addition the lawyer will usually charge in fifteen minute increments if the lawyer uses fixed fees they will charge you based on the services you need for example the lawyer might charge 500 to defend you at an arraignment and 1 500 to file a pretrial motion on your behalf criminal defense lawyers like their fees up front so they know they will get paid also ask about payment plans you might not have all of the money right up front however the lawyer could spread out a fixed fee payment over many months in addition the lawyer may accept property in lieu of cash in this scenario you would offer property you own e g houses cars paintings for the lawyers services after you have met with all of the lawyers you should compare them you want to hire someone you feel comfortable with take some time to sit down and analyze each lawyer consider the following did you feel comfortable asking questions if not then the lawyer might not be right for you did the lawyer explain things in an understandable way you want to stay involved in your defense so you should go with a lawyer who explains complex issues in a simple way are the fees reasonable you shouldn t hire a lawyer if you can t pay their fee what is your gut telling you no one can tell you which lawyer is best for you if none felt right then get more referrals and meet with them once you know which lawyer you want to hire you should call and tell them the lawyer will then send you a retainer agreement or engagement letter this letter spells out what the lawyer will do for you and how much you will have to pay you should sign the letter and send it back to the lawyer keep a copy for your own records consumer lawyers defend people against unlawful debt collection practices unlike criminal mistaken identity cases you will know if you have an issue as soon as debt collectors start contacting you about a debt that is not yours before you hire a lawyer talk with the debt collector that is contacting you let them know that you are not the person they are looking for and that they have mistaken you for someone else check to make sure they have the name contact information and even the social security number correct most of the time you and the debt collector will be able to resolve the issue quickly and painlessly however if the debt collector refuses to stop contacting you consider talking with a lawyer a consumer lawyer will be able to assess your situation and the debt collector s practices based on this information the lawyer should be able to help you assert a mistaken identity defense during litigation using friend and family recommendations lawyer referrals and state bar services make a list of qualified consumer lawyers in your area at this point keep track of every lawyer you hear about make sure you have the lawyer s name email address phone number and physical address take your big list and work on narrowing it down you will not have enough time to discuss your case with every person on your list instead find the lawyers who best fit your needs the easiest way to do this is to call the lawyer s office when you call ask what a normal hourly fee would be and whether they handle consumer cases involving mistaken identities if the lawyer s fees are in your price range and they handle cases of mistaken identities keep them on your short list after gathering a list of names you should go through and check each lawyer s background you can do all of this preliminary research on the internet for example make sure to do the following look at the lawyer s website check for their expertise and how professional the website appears someone with a sloppy website might not be a careful lawyer search online reviews many websites now post reviews avvo yelp google take these reviews with a grain of salt however if you notice common complaints such as the lawyer never returns phone calls then you should steer clear of that lawyer research the lawyer s disciplinary history each state has a board that investigates ethical complaints against lawyers you should find your state s website and search for the lawyer s disciplinary history a notation should appear if the lawyer has been disciplined once you have a list of lawyers you should call two or three that look good to you you probably don t have time for more ask if you can schedule a consultation and ask how much the lawyer charges many lawyers now offer free consultations others will charge a small fee you should call ahead of time to check also ask how you should pay you don t want to show up with only cash when the lawyer s office doesn t take cash when you meet with each lawyer come prepared and consider taking notes you will be ale to use these notes when it comes time to compare the lawyers you meet with when you talk with each lawyer be honest and open the lawyer will not be able to help you unless you tell them what you are dealing with keep in mind that any conversation you have with your lawyer is most likely protected by an attorney client privilege don t be afraid to ask your lawyer questions the initial consultation is not a one way street for example if you do not understand how the lawyer plans to attack your case ask them will they write the debt collector a letter will they file a lawsuit make sure you know the answers to these things before you hire someone make copies of every document you have relating to the case the lawyer will want to look at them and they will help provide a full picture of what you are dealing with in a consumer case of mistaken identity some of the most common documents you might have include mailings from debt collectors notes from your conversations with the debt collector which should include when you talked how long you talked what you talked about and what the outcome of those conversations were for example if the debt collector agreed that you are most likely not the person of interest write this down when you go in to a lawyer s office for an initial consultation you are not just assessing your fit with the individual lawyer you also need to make sure the lawyer s staff will be able to assist you for example consider whether the lawyer will have other people helping on your case does the lawyer have a law clerk or an associate are there paralegals in the office one of the most important things to look at is the lawyer s administrative staff for example does the lawyer have someone available to answer your calls when the lawyer is unable to do so themselves did the receptionist return your call in a timely manner were people friendly all of these things are important when hiring a lawyer in consumer cases regarding mistaken identities a lawyer will generally work with the debt collector to have the debt discharged if the debt collector continues their collection activities the lawyer may file a lawsuit on your behalf to make them stop until the lawyer files a lawsuit you will probably have to pay by the hour in some straightforward cases the lawyer may accept a flat fee for example if the lawyer feels confident that a simple cease and desist letter will take care of the matter the lawyer may charge a fixed fee for that service if litigation is involved the lawyer will most likely continue charging you an hourly fee however in a lot of consumer cases successful litigants are awarded attorneys fees therefore if you have a strong case your legal fees may end up getting reimbursed after you complete all of your initial consultations compare your experiences think about whether each lawyer was able to answer your questions in an understandable way also you want to make sure the lawyer you hire feels comfortable with the case you have if a lawyer seems unsure of their ability to represent you successfully don t hire them in addition to comparing the lawyers do not overlook the lawyer s staff and office remember you will be spending a good amount of time with this person and their office for some period of time you want to make sure you feel comfortable with the lawyer you choose once you have made your decision call the lawyer and tell them you would like to hire them if the lawyer is unable to take your case move on to your next choice when a lawyer accepts your case they will ask you to sign a retainer agreement or engagement letter this agreement will lay out the services the lawyer will perform for you and the fees they will charge if you are comfortable with the agreement sign it and start working with the lawyer 
query	124	plant turing sunflowers turing sunflowers are named for alan turing a mathematician that proposed that sunflower heads featured fibonacci number sequences fibonacci sequences of numbers begin with zero and one and each subsequent number in the sequence is the sum of the two numbers before it if you would like turing sunflowers to decorate your yard with a mathematical flair you will need to know how to plant and care for them planting turing s sunflowers ongoing care for turing s sunflowers removing turing sunflowers trying the turing sunflower experiment pick out a spot that is sunny and sheltered from the wind consider using a heavy container know that you might find a bit of a mess wherever you plant your sunflower seeds keep the frost in mind when planting your sunflowers prepare the area where you plan to plant your sunflowers consider planting your sunflowers from seeds plant your seeds consider planting two seeds at once give your tall sunflowers some support water your sunflowers protect your sunflowers from pests fertilize your plants consider leaving the dead sunflowers for the birds to eat cut the old stalks back get rid of seeds to prevent self seeding become familiar with who alan turing was learn how turing sunflowers came about consider participating in the experiment tall varieties of sunflowers require lots of sun and a sheltered position tall flower heads can bend over in moderate winds which can cause their stems to break you can also use fairly deep large containers and planters but they might need weighing down to prevent the tall plant from tipping them over heavy based pots are better such as ones made of stone or terracotta birds love sunflower seeds you may find birds will peck and scatter the seed heads which can make a big mess underneath the sunflowers the scattering of seeds also means that some of your sunflowers may self sow which means sunflowers might start growing in the general vicinity of the original sunflower it s best to wait until the frosts are over if you want to plant your sunflowers outdoors alternately you can start your sunflowers off in a pot indoors in the early spring and then move them outdoors in late spring once all risk of frost is over weed the area where you plan to plant your sunflower you can help improve soil fertility by mixing some compost into the soil to plant this tall variety of sunflowers start planting in the spring you can easily buy packets of seeds in gardening stores or online and they are some of the cheapest flower seeds to buy you may have less luck using seeds you have gathered yourself from previous year s sunflower harvest as these aren t always fertile plant the seeds about one inch deep into the compost you have mixed into your soil leave about 20 inches 50 8 cm of space between seeds then water the area well keep the soil moist until the sunflowers have sprouted sprouting can take two to three weeks some gardeners like to plant two seeds together as not all of them will sprout if both seedlings emerge you can remove and discard the one that looks less strong or transplant the seedling to another position at least 20 inches 50 8 cm away once the sunflower gets to be about waist height you might want to give the plant some support using a tall sturdy garden stake or cane drive this into the ground fairly deeply and then loosely tie the sunflower stalk to the cane you may want to tie the plant in another place further up the stem as it grows remember to give your sunflower some water during dry periods make sure not to over water your plant because sunflowers do not generally like having soggy feet slugs and snails may attack the young plants so you might consider covering them with a clear plastic bottle with the funnel end cut off to make a homemade cloche remember to remove this once the plant starts to outgrow it alternately consider using pellets or traps sunflowers are hungry plants you can really help the plant s growth by giving it a weekly feed with a liquid fertilizer avoid using slow release or granular fertilizers as these will release nutrients too slowly to benefit the fast growing plant you may find that the sunflowers won t grow as well the following year because the nutrients in that area have been depleted mix in plenty of manure at the end of the growing season to help stimulate regrowth you should get a good display of sunflowers by the late summer after that the flower heads will fade and the petals wither if you are a generous wildlife gardener it s beneficial to birds to leave the plants where they are so the birds can enjoy eating the seeds alternately you can cut the flowerheads and put them on a bird table sunflowers especially giant varieties leave a woody stalk behind cut this stalk to about knee height with a small hand saw then either pull it out of the ground or dig it out you can compost the stems sunflowers may self seed if you don t want volunteer self sown sunflowers in your garden the following year sweep up any seeds you see to stop them from scattering you may like to lay a sheet under the plants to catch any dropped seeds as you remove the flowerheads and the rest of the plant or you can hoe the area when the young seedlings emerge to kill them off alan turing was a brilliant mathematician credited with being a very significant figure in the birth of modern computing and artificial intelligence he made an enormous contribution to code breaking during world war ii and his work on breaking the code of the german naval enigma code machines is generally agreed to have helped shorten the conflict by several years to mark the centenary of turing s birth in 2012 a mass participation science project was proposed by the university of manchester where turing studied individuals groups and schools were encouraged to plant sunflowers to help prove turing s theories about the presence of fibonacci numbers in sunflowers this would also help commemorate this brilliant scientist as well as prove his work in a 2012 experiment examining 3000 sunflower heads turing s sunflowers aren t a special variety for the science experiment it was proposed that taller varieties were used these include sunflowers varieties such as russian giant giant single and giant yellow all these varieties grow to around 8 to 10 feet 2 4 to 3 0 m in height once the sunflowers are mature you might like to participate in the science project by examining the seeds has a good explanation of what you need to do to identify what s known as the fibonacci

query	127	create a perfect villain a good villain in a story can wreak havoc on other characters and help to generate conflict creating a perfect villain can really raise your story to the next level to create a perfect villain you should first understand the role of a villain build a backstory for the villain and then put the villain into action in your story recognizing the role of a villain building backstory for the villain putting the villain into action note the difference between a villain and a hero read examples of villains analyze the examples use an existing person as a model for the villain list the villain s five key character traits determine how and when the villain turned to the dark side outline the dark things done by the villain in the past give your villain humanizing traits decide if your villain will have special powers or abilities determine the conflict between the villain and the hero of your story give the villain a distinct voice create a master plan for the villain build up to a showdown between the hero and the villain in a traditional story the hero is the good person the one a reader or viewer will root for the villain is often portrayed as the bad person representing evil and darkness in the story the struggle between the hero and the villain sets up the major conflict in traditional stories with the hope that the hero wins and the villain fails keep in mind villains are often more terrifying and memorable to readers if they are multi dimensional often a villain who is as developed and detailed as the hero in a story will keep the reader engaged in the conflict and build tension taking the time to craft a well developed villain will only help your story become stronger and more memorable avoid using an abstract concept such as a disease a war or a corporation as a villain abstract villains are often too vague and general to elicit much emotion from your audience if you do want to use an abstract concept relate it to a particular person or being who will act as the villain in your story to get a better sense of how you can create a perfect villain you should read examples of villains who are popular among readers for example dr moriarty from sherlock holmes by sir arthur doyle satan from paradise lost by john milton count dracula from dracula by bram stoker sauron from the lord of the rings by j r r tolkien voldemort from the harry potter series by j k rowling once you have read several examples of villains in literature you should consider how the author crafts their villain you should also think about how certain villains are similar to one another and how they differ you may ask yourself how does the author characterize the villain does the author use physical and emotional characteristics to describe the villain how does the villain interact with the hero of the story what is the role of the villain in the story for example you may think about how tolkien s sauron is considered representative of all encompassing evil in the lord of the rings sauron is characterized by his power over the all seeing eye which sees everything in middle earth like the ultimate big brother in contrast doyle s dr moriarty is a criminal mastermind who tries to outsmart using intelligence tolkien s villain uses magic and doyle s villain uses intelligence but both villains push their respective stories forward into conflict to help you get inspiration for your villain you may a person who already exists that you find terrifying or scary this could be your older sibling a family friend or a celebrity using an existing person as a model can help make it easier to then add or subtract elements to create your own fictional version of the person for example maybe you create a villain based on a famous dictator like mao or a villain based on your scary aunt edna you may exaggerate some of the real life details of the person to make them appear more threatening or intimidating maybe you give aunt edna a physical trait that is scary such as a glass eye or a facial scar or maybe you exaggerate her personality making her meaner and more aggressive you may also look into historical figures who have been known as villains such as a serial killer or a political figure you could then add details to the historical figure to make them appear more villainous you can get a better sense of the villain by defining her by her key character traits these could be simple one word descriptors that help you paint a better picture of the villain and her goals once you sit down to write the story try to think of character traits that are more than just evil or crazy look for character traits that will define your particular villain and make her more than just a one note character for example you may write down attractive powerful jealous intelligent manipulative and quiet many of the more popular and successful villains in literature have engaging backstories where they have a history of bad deeds due to a pivotal event in their lives determining what event or moment made the villain turn dark can help to create a more fleshed out character it also allows you to avoid creating a one dimensional villain who only appears evil for evil s sake for example you may have a villain who witnessed trauma at a young age such as violence abuse or abandonment or you may have a villain who stumbled into a bad situation and made a poor moral judgement this may then have lead the villain down a dark path add to the villain s backstory by outlining her bad deeds this may be a progression of smaller bad deeds to bigger bad deeds or one or two awful things done within a certain period of time try to be detailed about these deeds as this will help you build the villain into a living breathing character who nevertheless makes choices and decisions just like everyone else for example you may list bad deeds done by the villain such as hurting specific characters or killing someone you may also note how these deeds were done maybe the villain got his henchmen to kill someone or personally hurt specific characters in vindictive and sadistic ways these dark things could then trigger the hero to go after the villain good villains will cause readers to question their own moral judgements as they may end up sympathizing with the villain despite the bad things he has done a villain who is sympathetic and evil is way more interesting than a villain who is just pure evil as readers will be quick to dismiss him and unable to relate to him giving your villain humanizing traits will prevent him from becoming a one dimensional character for example you may have a villain who cares for his children and is a good father despite his secret life as a serial killer or maybe have a villain who spares an innocent bystander despite his evil master plan to take over the world the villain satan from milton s paradise lost is portrayed as a fallen angel from heaven who is an outsider and an outcast these qualities are humanizing because most of us can relate to the feeling of being isolated or rejected in our own lives this makes milton s portrayal of satan more sympathetic and nuanced adding in details that make the villain human will also allow your story to feel more developed and well rounded a good rule of thumb is to make sure your villain is as detailed and defined as your hero this way the showdown between the two of them at the climax of the story will feel that much more exciting and engaging this may depend on if you are creating a villain for a genre story such as a fantasy story or if your story is based more in reality or the thriller genre your villain may have special powers or abilities that allow her to get a leg up on the hero and do incredible feats of evil giving your villain a specific power or ability will deepen her character and raise the stakes of the story for example maybe your villain is a genius mad scientist who uses this scientific abilities to create an evil monster or maybe your villain has the ability to access dark magic which then allows him to wreak havoc on a peaceful land you may want to consider giving your villain powers or abilities that run counter to your hero s powers or abilities for example maybe your hero is brilliant at a specific form of good magic which runs counter to the villain s skills in dark magic once you have given your villain a convincing backstory you should think about the nature of the conflict between your villain and your hero this will allow you to add to the villain s character and get a good sense of the villain s motivation as a character outlining their conflict will also help you structure the rest of the story starting from the beginning of the conflict and building up to the showdown between the villain and the hero for example the villain may desire powers that only the hero can access this may then lead to the villain seeking out the hero and plotting to control the hero for her own uses or maybe your villain can only achieve her goal by taking something from the hero she may then pursue the hero and hurt the hero leading the hero to retaliate and fight back one way to characterize the villain in a scene so she stands out is to give her a distinct voice think about how the villain might speak to others in a scene or to the hero maybe the villain has a unique perspective on a situation that comes through in the way she speaks ask yourself does the villain have an accent when she speaks does she use different wording or phrasing that indicates her evil nature many villains will speak with menace and use words to manipulate weaker characters maybe your villain is skilled at wordplay and uses words to confuse or trick other characters to give your villain purpose and meaning in your story you should map out his master plan doing this will also allow you to structure your story around the villain s master plan or factor in the master plan when you are thinking about how the hero will move through your story most villain s have elaborate plans with an ultimate goal or endgame defining this will also ensure your villain appears determined and motivated in every scene of your story as he has a clear purpose or goal for example your villain may have a master plan to use science to create a monster that will wreak havoc on the city and allow him to take vengeance on those who have wronged him in the past this master plan may then have several parts that you will need to show your reader so they get a sense of the villain s plan your villain may also work more in the shadows or pull strings behind the scenes moving one step ahead of your hero you may integrate his master plan into the larger story by having the hero discover clues of the plan leading to the ultimate showdown between the hero and the villain a perfect villain requires the ultimate showdown between good and evil your story should have a plot outline that builds up to a face off where the villain and the hero battle in some way this should be the high point of conflict and tension in the story where the villain finally unveils his true intentions to the hero your villain and your hero may battle through a game of wits or a battle of magic or your villain may set a trap that your hero must survive or a test that your hero must solve make sure the showdown is full of obstacles and difficulties created by the villain so the stakes are high for both the villain and the hero in your story

conflict for example you may realize that you have always wondered why your father is so estranged from his family and why your grandmother left china in the first place to come to america you may then use this conflict to structure and organize your story you may also research your family with this question in mind once you have done your research and spoken to your family about your intent to write the family history you should put together your family s story you may create a plot outline for the family history another option is to organize the story chronologically beginning with your family s origins and ending with their lives now you may also have several major conflicts throughout the story such as the time your grandmother ran off to marry your grandfather or the moment your great grandmother stepped on the boat to america use these conflicts to propel the story forward and make the story engaging once you are finished with a draft of the story share it with others and get feedback you may share it with your family members to get their opinion on it you may also share it with colleagues or friends who have experience in writing to get feedback be open to constructive criticism and revise the draft until it is at its best keep in mind your family members may have more edits or opinions on the draft than others try to accommodate their feedback as you are writing their family history too but you should also be willing to argue against their feedback if you think it will be detrimental to the overall story or not in keeping with the facts of the family history writing a personal memoir can be a fun and challenging way to write about your family you may write a memoir as part of an assignment for a class or as a personal project to write the memoir you will first need to do research on your family history this may mean interviewing your family members searching through public records for information on your family and creating a family tree as you do your research you should talk to your family about your plans to write a memoir let them know that you are researching your family for a book discussing the book with them will make the memoir more compelling and give you more information to work with keep in mind your family may not all be thrilled at the idea of the memoir at first especially if they are nervous or worried about certain family details coming to light be tactful and patient with your family explain to them that you are writing a memoir from your perspective and that there is never one side to any story assure them that you will let them read the final draft once it is done to get a better idea of how to approach your family s story you may read examples of non fiction work about family you may focus on a writer that has a particular style or voice that you love or if you are focusing on a specific family dynamic such as an immigrant family story you may read works that relate to that dynamic for example you may read angela s ashes by frank mccourtthe woman warrior by maxine hong kingstonnotes of a native son by james baldwinrunning in the family by michael ondaatjethe glass castle by jeannette walls you may realize there is a specific issue or theme that keeps coming up when you talk to your family members and do research on your family you may use this issue or theme to structure your story you could also include your own reflections on the theme or issue in your piece about your family for example perhaps you notice the theme of assimilation keeps coming up in your research of your family or maybe there is the common issue of the women in your family overcoming obstacles to raise their children in america creating a plot outline for your family s story will help you stay focused and organized you may make a loose plot outline that is broken into chapters or sections or you may go for a more traditional plot outline that is based on a plot diagram whichever approach you choose having a plot outline can make diving into the writing of the story much easier a plot diagram contains five parts the exposition the inciting incident the rising action the climax the falling action and the resolution you can also try using the snowflake method where you write a one sentence summary of the story followed by a one paragraph summary character synopses and a spreadsheet of scenes in personal memoir you are exploring your family relationships from your perspective you should look at your family memories and your experiences with your family perhaps you realize there is a central conflict in your memories and experiences that you would like to explore further or maybe there is a particular memory you have from childhood that had a big impact on your family and the rest of your childhood if you are writing about a memory or experience that is difficult to confront such as a memory of abuse or neglect from a family member you may need to write several drafts of the memory take your time and try to focus on sensory details in the memory be honest about how you feel about the memory on the page and don t be afraid to dig deep once you have completed a draft of your story about your family you should spend time polishing it until it is at its best read the draft aloud to yourself listen to how each section flows into one another pay attention to how you characterize each member of your family notice if there are any sections that feel flat or not as full of tension and conflict as they could be you should ask yourself several questions as you revise including do the characters in the story feel like fair representations of my real family is the conflict in the story and is it meaningful do i need to include more reflections on my family from my perspective you should consider showing the draft of your story to your family members especially if you are planning to try to get the story published get feedback from your family members ask them if they feel the story is accurate of the family s history be willing to listen to what they have to say and integrate their feedback into your next draft depending on what you write some of your family members may be upset or unsettled by your story this may occur if you are writing about a family secret or a difficult period in your family s history you should be prepare to defend or explain the choices you made in your story to your family members you may also get feedback on the draft from close family friends or colleagues that you are close to if you are looking for professional guidance on your draft you may enroll in a writing workshop that focuses on non fiction and memoir writing you may then get valuable feedback on your draft from other writers who are also exploring their family history you may be able to find non fiction writing groups online or at your local college or university if you have friends or colleagues who have experience writing memoir you may approach them and ask if they d be willing to start a writing group if you are writing about your family as a way to practice and improve your english you should use a prompt to get you started you can create your own prompt or find a prompt online you may challenge yourself to write a certain number of words about your family such as 250 words or you may challenge yourself to write a certain number of sentences about your family such as 10 sentences for example you may use a prompt like write about your family members or my family members are as part of the prompt you could pretend you are talking to someone you just met who asked you to tell them about your family when you write about your family use the present tense and write in short clear sentences identify all of your family members by name and discuss where your family members live use brother sister mother father uncle aunt cousin etc to identify your family members for example you may write let me tell you about my family i have a mother a father two brothers and one sister we also have a dog named pepper we all live together in a house in reno nevada we have lived in the house since i was born after they were married my mother and my father moved to the house to start a family once you have completed the draft about your family you should show it to others to get feedback show the draft to your teacher your instructor or to a native english speaker get feedback from them on your sentence structure your word choice and your spelling or grammar then apply the feedback to the draft you may end up adding in more details into the draft based on your teacher s feedback by the end of the revision process you should have a strong completed draft that showcases your english skills 
query	129	appreciate jazz music jazz is an american form of music that was born sometime around the year 1900 out of a diverse number of cultures and musical styles 1 sometimes restrained and intimate

a better appreciation of jazz you may deepen your appreciation of your favorite hits as well 2 knowing what to look for in jazz enjoying jazz understanding the evolution of jazz pick out the original melody develop a feel for the harmony catch the rhythm assess the forms of improvisation being used recognize the unity of the ensemble attend a jazz venue see a jazz festival be in the moment get into the swing of it brush up on the blues listen to ragtime get a taste of new orleans jazz continue learning about jazz the melody is the main theme of a song in jazz it s common for you to hear the same song twice and notice many differences between performers performances and even recordings this is because jazz musicians have a great deal of freedom in how they play the base melody serving as the foundation for its sound learning to pick out the main melody among the complex variations of individual instrumentalists is part of the fun of jazz you may notice that some performers have certain features or a distinct sound picking out and noticing these features can be a fun way for you to engage the music if you hear a melody you particularly enjoy you may want to explore variations of it to do this you might search for performances of the same song by different jazz artists or ensembles online listening to a song you re already somewhat familiar with may help you pick out the melody more easily some famous jazz hits you might want to give a listen to include take five sing sing sing so what and round midnight there are many layers to jazz music the melody should be the most distinct topmost layer but behind that you should hear a harmonious structure of chords generally there will be three different chords used with each of these being played in various ways to give the harmony of the song a broad range of variety it s very common for artist to break up harmonic chords to create a sustained pleasing sound while the melody is played you may want to keep an ear out for broken chords rolled chords and other variations in the harmony while listening to jazz many public radio services like your local classical jazz station or npr have segments devoted to jazz music you may learn more about harmony listening to these segments and the accompanying commentary of the djs the complex and regularly changing rhythms of jazz are a key feature to the genre the main beat of a song will often be elongated or shortened to add punch and flourish to the musical phrases in it you can easily notice where artists take liberties with the beat by following along with the main beat yourself while listening it may help you follow the beat if you tap your foot or your hand steadily in time with the music this will be the dominant rhythm of the song when you notice players hold out or cut short beats you ve discovered a change to the rhythm these off beat rhythms generally sync up with the main beat later on you may want to tap along quietly especially if you are attending a live jazz performance following the beat too loudly by clapping tapping your hands feet could disrupt the musicians swing music having a pronounced rhythmic quality may make feeling the rhythm easier for you some popular swing tunes you might be interested hearing include caravan take the a train and sweet georgia brown improvisation may be the feature of jazz most familiar to you however you may not know that there are different kinds of improv that jazz musicians use when playing these are broken up into three main categories that you may want to keep in mind when listening paraphrase improv paraphrase improv uses the melody like a springboard oftentimes an artist will feature the melody strongly throughout the piece waiting for specific places or themes before exploding into a variation motivic improv the name of this kind of improv comes from the word motif it uses repeated sections of the song at higher and lower intervals to change the atmosphere and quality of the motif being repeated formulaic improv this kind of improv requires the most technical knowledge on the part of the performer during formulaic improv a musician will insert highly complex combinations of notes often referred to as licks to spice up a solo since improvisation is such an important part of jazz music the players in an ensemble must be well coordinated for there to be cohesion throughout a performance in many cases this takes the form of signals gestures or other kinds of cues between players like a certain riff played on an instrument or a particular note in the melody that s leaned on heavily looking for the signals between performers or even noting the level of unity and balance among them can add another level to your jazz appreciation you may find that even if you don t like the tune the interaction between players still makes the music enjoyable there may be a local jazz club or bar near you where you can listen to jazz however if this kind of environment isn t your scene many universities and music institutes conservatories put on jazz events throughout the year that you can attend one benefit to seeing jazz live is its engagement of your senses not only can you hear the music and see the performers in action but in many cases you will be able to feel the music as its vibrations hit your skin observe good etiquette while you re at a jazz performance this is especially important at a jazz club or bar most performers will expect you to be respectful during the performance this means you should keep the volume of your conversations to a minimum the spontaneous nature of jazz makes live events the perfect place for you to get into the spirit of the genre recordings in many cases fail to convey the atmosphere of a performance many communities put on local events and festivals celebrating the jazz its history and its culture this is an excellent opportunity for you to mingle with and learn from longtime jazz fans and musicians at many of these events influential jazz artists as well as up and comers will play music giving you a chance to hear contemporary and classic jazz depending on the region in which you live the kind of festivals available will vary some major jazz festivals you might consider visiting include the chicago jazz music festival late august early september saratoga jazz festival late june portland jazz festival mid february fillmore street jazz festival early july and jacksonville jazz festival late may while listening to the jazz it s easy to get caught up in technical details or you can be distracted by your search for specific features in a song or ensemble ultimately jazz is based on the emotions of the performers the sound they craft during a performance is intended to capture that feeling whatever it may be try to feel with the performers as they play although the atmosphere of a venue can contribute a great deal to the atmosphere it can also be distracting you may want to close your eyes during part of the performance and see what feelings colors shapes or thoughts are evoked by the music the swing rhythm used in jazz songs infuses the music with a sense of forward momentum bounciness lightness and urgency this excitable ambiance looks for a similar response the listener creating a kind of conversation between performers and audience this is intentional as swing was derived from call and response musical styles of that time jazz was originally used as dance music in the early 1900s for youth rebelling against musical and social conventions if you re at an appropriate venue you may find that you connect better with jazz when you get out of your seat and start dancing along because jazz and the blues essentially grew up alongside each other in the early 1900s you ll find many similarities between the two genres of music in particular you ll notice that both jazz and the blues make use of blue notes which are notes played a little lower than the major scale of a piece this gives the music its iconic mournful bluesy sound in listening to blues and other music originating from the same period as jazz you ll gain a finer understanding for the atmosphere of that era this could help you connect more deeply with the music on an emotional or technical level the blues have been played in some form or another since the late 1800s so there are many artists in this genre you might listen to however three blues musicians highly influential to the jazz scene include w c handy huddie lead belly ledbetter and bessie smith ragtime introduced the jazz scene to syncopation which is the practice of strengthening weak beats and weakening strong beats this style is featured extensively in jazz you should note the offbeat quality syncopation gives jazz music this creates variety and a sense of drive in the music that makes it more exciting you can get a better feel for syncopation with a foot tapping exercise tap your foot up and down steadily when you bring your foot down say oom and when you raise your foot say pah so as you tap you should say oom pah oom pah then while continuing tapping your foot only say the pah this pah represents the syncopated beat jazz artists will include a mix of syncopated off beat and non syncopated on beat rhythms this creates additional complexity and emphasis in the song identifying off and on beat rhythms may add a new dimension to your appreciation of jazz the new orleans music scene greatly encouraged the use of brass instruments and syncopation in jazz while contributing to ensemble structure this structure generally relied on a brass instrumentalist frequently called the frontline and a two person rhythm section popular frontline instruments included the trumpet cornet trombone and clarinet rhythm section instruments often included the piano drums string bass and banjo thanks to the invention of the phonograph many classic songs that came out of the new orleans jazz age could be preserved listen along with joe king oliver jelly roll morton and the original dixieland jass band to familiarize yourself with new orleans jazz jazz has a long and colorful history that includes many styles and sub genres classic jazz swing bebop cool jazz bossa nova jazz fusion acid jazz and other jazz sub genres ensure that you ll have plenty to listen to in your journey to gain a better appreciation of jazz to gain a more formal understanding of jazz and jazz history you may want to take a class on the subject these can frequently be found at your nearest local university community college community center or school of music you may find that a trip to a historic jazz site like a nightclub or historic jazz composer s home gives you a fuller understanding of jazz many of these sites have information in the form of pamphlets that you can use to buff up on jazz

to resemble the ones worn in the friday the 13th series without his trusty machete jason would just be a lumbering mouth breather with questionable fashion sense do the costume justice by purchasing a plastic costume machete and using it to terrorize your friends a little dab of fake blood will make it look ominously like it s been recently used never carry around a real machete or any other

to showing his face before he stumbled upon the hockey mask that would come to define his image he kept his features concealed with a dingy old pillow case with one eye hole cut out fortunately this part of the costume is extremely easy to replicate for best results use a different pillowcase than the one you plan to lug your halloween candy around in later to make an eye hole for visibility put the pillowcase on over your head mark where your left eye is with a pencil and then use scissors to carefully cut out the eye hole if you want to be especially accurate keep the pillow case secured around your neck using a little rope or butcher s twine for his first foray into bloodshed jason used various farming tools for hacking slashing and poking having not yet discovered the versatility

query	131	read guitar tabs guitarists have their own special system of music notation called guitar tablature or guitar tabs for short using guitar tabs a guitarist can play a wide variety of music without ever having to learn how to read standard sheet music though guitar tabs aren t a perfect way of describing music they ve allowed newer generations of guitarists to quickly and easily share information about how to play songs across the globe via the internet every guitarist should have at least a basic understanding of how to read tablature it s the de facto shorthand for much of the guitar music you ll find written out online using tabs to fret notes and chords reading special symbols reading an example tab view tab notation as a representation of the guitar s strings use the numbers on the tab to fret spaces on the neck play vertically stacked numbers at the same time proceed from left to right look for lyrics or chord changes look for additional symbols in the tab learn the symbol for hammer ons learn the symbol for pull offs learn the symbol for string bends learn the symbols for slide techniques learn the symbols for tremolo bar techniques learn the symbol for vibrato learn the symbols for muting techniques learn the symbol for tapping learn the symbols for harmonic techniques learn the symbol for trills learn the symbol for tremolo picking glance over the tab below start with the chord at the far left proceed to the next two chords play the individual notes at the right put it all together a tab is usually written using six horizontal lines each corresponding with a string on the guitar the bottom line represents the lowest thickest string while the top string represents the highest thinnest string for standard tunings this means that the lines will represent from the bottom up the low e a d g b and high e strings e thinnest string b g d a e thickest string unlike normal musical notation guitar tabs don t tell you which notes to play instead they tell you where to put your fingers numbers on the lines correspond to frets on the fretboard each number represents a specific fret on the line it s written on for instance a 1 on the bottom line means to fret the first fret of the lowest string and play that note if the number is greater than 0 1 2 3 4 etc then press your finger on that fret when you play with 1 being the fret closest to the stock and fret numbers increasing as you move towards the guitar s body if the number is 0 then pluck the open string without fretting any notes when reading tabs many times you ll come across numbers that are aligned vertically these are chords fret every note in the chord as written then play the notes all at the same time you ll get a fuller sound than you might see the chord name written as well see example 2 below tabs are read like sentences in a book read them from left to right across the page dropping down to the next line only when you ve reached the end of the previous play the notes and chords in sequence as you read them from left to right note that most but not all tabs don t display the rhythm with which you should play the notes in the tab they may break the tab into measures usually signified by vertical lines in the tab between measures but they won t tell you the rhythm of the notes within the measures in this case it s best to listen to the song while you read the tab to find the beat some advanced tabs do count out the beat for you this is usually done by including rhythmic markings along the top of the tab notation each marking is vertically aligned with a note or a rest to give a sense of how long the note or rest lasts typical rhythmic markings include w whole note h half note q quarter note e eighth note s sixteenth note sometimes markings are included to show that a note or rest lies on the and of a certain beat a dot after the rhythm marking means the corresponding note or rest is dotted for instance q dotted quarter note for rhythm basics see how to read music many songs have guitar parts made up solely or mostly of chords this is especially true for rhythm guitar parts in this case the tab may forgo typical tab notation in favor of a simplified list of chord changes these chords are almost always written in standard chord notation amin a minor e7 e dominant 7 etc simply play the chords in the order that they re listed if it s not noted otherwise try playing one chord per measure but if the changes don t sound right listen to the song for the strumming pattern sometimes these chord changes are printed above the lyrics of the song to give you a sense of when these chords are played as in this snippet from a tab for the beatles twist and shout a7 d g a well shake it up baby now shake it up baby as you can see in the example above many tabs aren t just collections of lines and notes tabs use a wide variety of special symbols to tell you how to play the notes in the tab most symbols refer to specific playing techniques to make a song sound as much like the recording as possible pay attention to these special markings in a tab an h inserted between two notes e g 7h9 means to perform a hammer on to hammer on play the first note normally then use a finger on your fretting hand to tap down on the second note without using your strumming hand to pluck the note sometimes is used instead e g 7 9 a p inserted between two notes e g 9p7 means to perform a pull off which is essentially the opposite of a hammer on pluck the first note while using another finger to fret the second note then quickly lift the finger fretting the first note the second note will sound as with hammer ons sometimes is used instead e g 9 7 in this case know to perform a pull off if the second note is lower and a hammer on if the second note is higher if a b is inserted between two fret numbers e g 7b9 fret the first note and bend it up until it sounds like the second sometimes the second number is in parentheses and occasionally the b is omitted altogether if there is an r it denotes what the note should be released to e g 7b9r7 perform a basic slide by striking a note moving your finger up or down a string without releasing it from the fretboard then striking another note an ascending slide is marked by a forward slash and a descending slide is marked by a backwards slash e g 7 9 7 a lowercase s usually means to perform a legato slide this is like a normal slide but you only strike the first note with your pick let your target note sound simply from the motion in your fret hand there is debate among guitarists over whether a light pick strike is appropriate for the target note the most important thing is to remember to leave no gap between notes shift slides are signified by an uppercase s in this case strike the target note without striking the initial note of the slide if your guitar has a tremolo bar also known as a whammy bar or vibrato bar follow these symbols to achieve some remarkably out there effects if you see a n where n some number perform a tremolo bar dip quickly hit and release the bar to dip the note s pitch the number between the slashes gives an indication of the pitch you should dip to dip the pitch by n semitones a semitone is the same as the pitch between two adjacent frets for instance 5 means to drop the pitch by 5 semitones which will be the same tone as 5 frets below the original note if you see a n where n some number fret note n then strike it and depress the tremolo bar deeply to dramatically drop the pitch if you see n raise the tremolo bar up after striking note n to raise the pitch on some guitars you can also put your bar in inverted position first so that hitting the bar raises the pitch rather than lowers it if you see n perform a tremolo bar inverted dip by first depressing the tremolo bar then raising it as above this also works in inverted position look for or v if you see these symbols perform vibrato on the preceding note strike the note then use your fretting hand to rapidly bend and unbend the string vibrating the pitch of the note several tab symbols indicate different methods for giving notes a muted sound if you see an x or a dot below the number mute the string lay your fretting hand finger s across the designated strings so that when you strike them they produce a dull clicking sound several x in a row on adjacent strings indicates a rake just mute more than one string at once if you see pm play using palm muting for standard right handed guitar playing gently lay the edge of your right palm across the strings near the guitar s bridge when you strike the notes with the same hand as is providing the mute you should hear the tone of the note but with a subdued dead quality move your hand slightly up the strings toward the neck to deaden the notes more tapping is usually represented by a t if you see a t in a string of notes e g 2h5t12p5p2 use one of the fingers on your picking hand usually your right hand to tap down hard on the indicated fret this is a useful technique for making very rapid fast changes in pitch guitar tabs differentiate between several different techniques for playing harmonics bell like tones created by special fretting techniques for natural harmonics the fret is surrounded by e g 7 if you see this lay a fretting finger across the metal line at the right of the fret not the middle of the fret then strike the string for a clear bell tone pinch harmonics are signified by surrounding the fret number in brackets e g to perform a pinch harmonic strike the note with your pick hand while your pick hand thumb is also touching the note use vibrato from your fret hand to add sustain to the tone pinch harmonics are difficult it requires lots of practice note these are best performed on an electric guitar with distortion using a bridge pickup tapped harmonics are signified by two notes the second enclosed in parentheses e g n n tapped harmonics are like natural harmonics but shifted around the neck fret the first note then use a finger on your pick hand to slap or strike the string at the second fret position when you see a tr written in or above the tab it s usually between or above two notes often it s accompanied by a string of tildes s this simply means to strike the first note then rapidly hammer on to the second note and pull off to the first note again and again tp means you should tremolo pick the note essentially pick the single note over and over as rapidly as you can sometimes a tp symbol is followed by a string of tildes or dashes to give you a sense of how long to tremolo pick notice that it shows several three note chords as well as some individual notes descending on the higher strings in the following steps we ll

help you make the best decisions about everything from what kind of tree best suits your needs to where to plant it you ll need to think about the weather in your local area before planting a tree to make sure that you get a species that will survive and thrive in your garden or yard using the plant hardiness zone scale can help not only identify your local climate but also the best types of trees to plant the arbor day foundation offers a system of identifying climate for plants called the plant hardiness zones it divides the united states and canada into 11 different zones that are based on a 10 degree fahrenheit difference in the average annual minimum temperature the united states for examples is located within zones 2 through 10 you can access the plant hardiness zones at http shop arborday org content aspx page zone lookup and then lookup the zone in which you fall knowing your zone will help you identify the types of trees and other plants that you can plant and expect to grow in the zone s temperature extremes know that the plant hardiness zones don t account for local differences including moisture soil winds and other conditions that could affect the survivability of individual plants you ll also want to consider the terrain on your property before you plant a tree factors such as slope neighbors drainage and erosion can have an impact on what trees will thrive on your land for example if you live on particularly hilly or steep land it may not be a good idea to plant trees because their roots may not be able to take proper hold if you re planting a tree or trees to combat erosion you ll want to plant trees that already have a strong root ball so they don t get swept away at the next rainfall or windstorm think about what kinds of other trees and plants are there so that the tree you plant not only fits in with the overall aesthetic scheme but also that the tree has room to grow and won t kill other plants and trees around it most communities will have zoning laws about trees and digging holes on properties within its borders it s important to check these laws to make sure that you are able to dig and plant trees if not the community may not only prevent you from planting the tree but also force you to pay fines zoning laws related to planting are often related to digging holes near telephone and electric poles and other cables you ll need to make sure that you know where these cables and systems before you dig you may also want to check with local utility companies about digging around their poles and cables so that you don t disturb them or harm anyone when you plant or as the tree grows in the united states you can call 811 before you dig this will get your underground utility lines marked for free which will help to prevent damage injury and fines if you have any questions or are unsure about something related to planting a tree talk to a professional arborist in your area consulting with someone who understands

you re ready to buy a tree to plant purchase a suitable tree for the region climate and your yard trees native to your area tend to do well and you won t be introducing a potential invasive plant species it will be easier to care for a tree that is already native to the area you can find the best species of tree for your area for example if you live in northern canada planting a palm tree probably isn t feasible the arbor day foundation can help you find the best tree for your area simply by putting in your zip code or plant hardiness zone into the search engine at http shop arborday org content aspx page tree nursery as a rule of thumb plants with bare roots those that are in burlap and not in a container thrive much better than trees that are in containers you want to give your plant the best chance at growing and surviving planting at the right time of year is a key factor in this planting times will vary depending on the plant and where you live again this will vary depending on where you live if you are not sure of the best time of year to plant your tree consult your local university extension service or similar service each county in the united states has a university extension service and many countries including india and kenya have them as well if you are in the united states you can locate your local university extension service using the national institute for food and agriculture s interactive online map at http nifa usda gov partners and extension map once you ve purchased your tree you need to prepare it for planting this will help ensure that you re planting the tree properly and that it will survive the process is slightly different for a small tree and a large tree if the tree is a sapling turn it upside down gently to get it out of the container if it is in burlap wait to cut it off until you ve planted the tree in the ground if the tree is beyond the sapling stage cut through its packaging if it is in burlap wait to cut it off until you ve planted the tree in the ground if there is a wire basket or wiring on your tree s roots remove it with wire cutters so that it doesn t grow into the roots and kill the tree keep as much dirt around the roots as possible and don t move it more than necessary to keep the roots from drying out don t leave a tree s roots out of its container or burlap for too long because this could damage or dry them out if you ve decided to plant a seed instead of an already growing tree follow this step growing a tree from a seed means germinating the seed planting it at the appropriate time and taking close care of it this method will take than transplanting a tree from a container to get a seed to germinate you may have to use scarification this means that you break the seed coat and allow moisture to penetrate so that the plant embryo can begin germinating once the seeds have germinated plant them in an individual container or a seed tray move the trays or contains to a brighter location that is well ventilated each type of tree has different seeds with different needs so make sure to follow the instructions accordingly for the type of tree you are planting for example if you are planting a seed from a golden delicious apple you won t necessarily get a golden delicious apple tree you ll only be able to tell once the tree fruits if you want to grow a tree that yields a certain type of fruit it s best to buy one from a nursery to help ensure that it has good rootstock and that you get exactly the fruit you want once you ve had a chance to look at your land and think about what your goal is you can decide on a spot to plant your tree mark this spot with a bright and wide circle make sure to take things like power lines the location of your house and driveway as well as other trees into consideration so that the roots don t damage your property as they grow use a special marking paint to mark your spot these containers have a special nozzle so that you can spray them upside down before you start digging the hole to plant your tree measure the plant s root ball this will tell you how deep you need to dig the hole at this point you can remove the burlap that is around the root flare or where the roots connect to the trunk using a cultivator or garden trowel remove the top layer of soil from the root ball remove only enough soil to expose the root flare measure the height and width of the root ball from the ground to the top of the exposed root flare and from one side to the other using a shovel dig the hole in which you ll plant your tree you want to make sure that it is large enough to accommodate the tree s size and give it plenty of room to grow and take root dig a hole that is 2 3 wider and about as deep than the root ball this will give the tree enough room to fit and allow fresh roots to grow without stress try to dig the hole with a small pedestal of dirt in the center of the hole where the tree will rest the hole should be a little deeper around the edges but there should be a pedestal of dirt in the center where the root ball sits this pedestal prevents the root ball from sitting continuously in water any excess water will naturally flow to the deeper areas of the hole around the edges where the roots can drink from if needed measure the hole to see if it is wide and deep enough if necessary dig out more soil to reach the desired depth and width put a light coating of superphosphate in the hole to promote a healthy root system the time has finally come to plant your tree after you ve carefully prepared the hole place the tree gently into its new home if it doesn t fit remove it and adjust the size of the hole be sure the hole isn t too deep or too shallow the ground level of the plant should match up with the ground level after you backfill the hole do not bury over where the stem changes to root also called the crown or leave any roots exposed you can place the handle of your shovel flat across the hole from one side to the other to measure whether the crown is level with the surrounding soil before filling in the hole when the tree is in the hole identify its best face and turn it in the direction you want taking this step will make sure that you can enjoy how the tree looks and also make sure your tree has its best face forward remove any burlap from the tree s roots at this stage make sure you position the tree as upright as possible how you position the tree will affect how it grows in later years for years consider using a level to measure if you ve positioned the tree upright you can also ask a friend or family member to see if the tree is positioned perfectly upright use stakes to help the tree grow upright if necessary using a mixture of compost and the soil you dug out while you prepared the hole backfill or refill the hole make sure you have enough soil to support the roots while giving them room to grow backfill three quarters of the hole with existing dirt one quarter with compost or composted manure as needed it s important to make sure that there are no air pockets around the roots as you backfill the hole in order to get rid of any air pockets that might be present backfill only part of the hole and then lightly tamp it down with your hands or the shovel do this for subsequent layers when tamping down backfill make sure to proceed gently and also not use your feet because you could trample the roots use some compost or composted manure if needed if the soil that you currently have is not rich has clay like qualities or has the consistency of dust or sand the addition of manure or compost will give the tree a great start in life if the compost or manure smells it hasn t been properly composted and shouldn t be used because it can burn your tree resist the temptation to use a commercial fertilizer it can over boost the tree and make it burn out or not thrive give fruit and nut trees extra attention adding manure or compost is essential if you are planting a fruit or nut tree if your tree is still a sapling use a stake to help it grow for about the first year of its life this will keep the tree from blowing over in the wind and allow the roots to become established make sure the stakes you are tied loosely to the trunk do not dig into the bark or tighten around the trunk remove the stakes once the roots have a chance to become established after about a year larger trees may need two or three stakes once the tree is planted water it and keep up a regular schedule of watering this will help the roots become established in the surrounding soil water the tree every day for several weeks to let the roots get established after this you can reduce the frequency of watering water as necessary for the conditions in your area take into consideration humidity rainfall and sunshine to help you decide when to water your tree if you are planting fruit or nut trees for a small home orchard continue to water weekly for the life of the tree as your crop depends on consistent irrigation you ll also want to fertilize fruit and nut trees monthly or according to package directions considering adding a layer of mulch around your tree to help keep moisture in and weeds out cover the planting hole with 1 3 inches 2 5 cm 7 6 cm of shredded hardwood or leaf mulch keep the mulch at least 12 inches away from the trunk or it may cause the trunk to rot mulching around the tree will protect the tree from trampling and lawnmowers which are two activities that commonly kill young trees if there are any broken dead or diseased limbs on your tree remove them gently with a knife or gardening shears if there is nothing wrong with the tree there is no need to prune it until after the first growing season appreciate its shade and beauty and thank yourself for adding another tree to the world you won t regret it and as long as you properly care for it the tree can grow a long time you ll need to make sure that you water your plant to keep it thriving you want to achieve a balance of giving it enough water to penetrate the roots while not drowning it watering your tree with a steady stream from a garden hose for about 30 seconds should be sufficient the soil should feel moist at all times and mulch will help retain the moisture check soil moisture by digging about 2 below the surface and then use your finger to test if soil is moist if it is you don t need to water 
query	133	dance bachata a simple but sensuous dance originating from the dominican republic the colorful roots of bachata are reflected both in its romantic motions and its accompanying music today this suave passionate form of dance enjoys popularity all over latin america and beyond having gained popularity across the western world bachata is relatively easy for newcomers but also allows dance masters plenty of freedom to flaunt their skills learning basic bachata on your own incorporating a partner spicing it up feel the beat step to the left notice the motion in your hips repeat your steps in the opposite direction keep time and repeat ask your partner to dance hold your partner step with your partner incorporate back and forth motion add turns pay attention to your partner get your whole body in motion add bachata urbana flavor add complex footwork bachata is an 8 beat dance like the salsa bachata music has four beats per measure at its most basic bachata has dancers move left for one four beat measure then right for the next listen to the music and try to find the pulsing beat modern electronic bachata music usually has some form of synth percussion hitting every beat which makes the beat easy to find traditional bachata music can have slightly more complex percussion but usually still have beats that are easy to feel here s an example of how you ll count your steps during a basic bachata stepping to the left 1 2 3 4 stepping to the right 5 6 7 8 stepping to the left 1 2 3 4 etc the 4th and 8th beats are marked in parentheses because these beats are often counted silently in terms of modern pop bachata you might want to check out the work of modern latino artists like prince royce anthony santos aventura don omar and maite perroni these artists are influenced by bachata and many record songs in modernized bachata style try starting with creiste by anthony santos older more traditional bachata artists may be slightly more obscure today owing to the popularity of their pop counterparts try checking out artists like yoskar sarante frank reyes and joe veras the song intentalo tu by joe veras is a great bachata tune with a semi traditional flavor begin with both your feet together count the beat of the music 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 when you re ready start by stepping to the left with your left foot on beat 1 then bring your right foot to your left foot on beat 2 step left with your left foot again on beat 3 then finally raise your right foot off the ground slightly on beat 4 you may have noticed that by raising your right foot off the ground slightly you were forced to jut your hips out to the right this is perfect eventually the effect you want to create is that of a continuous rolling motion in your hips as you continue to dance be conscious of the motion of your hips don t stop plant your right foot on the ground on the next beat 1 stepping to the right then just mirror the motions you ve already made in the opposite direction bring your left foot to your right on beat 2 step right on beat 3 and raise your left foot slightly on 4 your hips should jut to the left now practice these basic steps until you think you have a sense for the basic pulse of bachata as you dance keep your knees slightly bent obviously bending your knee more when you raise your foot and try to keep a slight rhythmic swaying motion in your hips in bachata as with many forms of latin dance the swaying motion in the hips is typically more pronounced in the female partner than in the male partner if you think this is too simple don t worry the bachata is about to get much more interesting knowing how to graciously accept either a yes or a no is essential for avoiding awkwardness at clubs parties quincea eras and other places where you may want to do the bachata in traditional bachata men ask women to dance the instructions below assume a traditional situation however today it s perfectly acceptable for women to do the asking gentlemen when you want to dance with someone be direct yet courteous approach your potential partner directly offer her your hand palm up and say something short and to the point along the lines of hey would you like to dance if she accepts great take her hand and move to the dance floor if for any reason she doesn t want to politely acquiesce with a short acknowledgement like oh ok no problem then move on ladies when you re asked to dance reply graciously but honestly if you do want to dance simply say i d love to then take your partner s hand and proceed to the dance floor if you don t decline politely briefly and honestly explaining why you d rather not for instance you might say something like oh i wish i could but my heels are killing me in bachata there are two basic positions for holding your partner open position and closed position open position puts more space between the two partners as they make contact only through their hands open position allows more space and flexibility when it comes to advanced moves like turns closed position on the other hand is somewhat more intimate as it involves an arm draped across the lady s back and slight to strong contact between the two partners bodies closed position is more common in modern clubs and dance halls owing to cramped floor space see below for instructions on both positions gentlemen for open position keep your arms loose and relaxed offer your lady partner both palms facing up she ll gently place her hands in yours allow them to rest there don t grab with your thumbs both your and your partners elbows should be bent at your sides which will put your bodies about a foot or two apart for closed position wrap your arm around your lady s body so that your palm is resting roughly in the middle of her back she will drape her arm over yours resting her hand near your shoulder using your unoccupied arm which is called your leading arm hold her other hand out to the side at about shoulder or chest height keeping both of your elbows bent don t interlock fingers your hands should be held palm on palm with the back of your hand facing out as you dance use your outstretched hand to lead your partner gently guiding her upper body in the direction you re moving ladies for open position keep your arms loose and relaxed lay your hands palms down in your partner s remember to keep your elbows bent to allow flexibility and ensure you re somewhat close to your partner for closed position when your partner wraps his arm around your back lay your arm over his and rest it near his shoulder allow your partner to hold your other hand the back of your hand should be facing towards you while the back of his should be facing out keep your elbows bent and remember to keep a palm palm hand hold don t interlock fingers practice simply moving in time to the music with your partner you may find that coordinating your movements so that you both step on the beat is harder than you first thought regardless of whether you re in open or closed position both partners perform basically the same left four beats right four beats motion described above however realize that since both partners are facing each other one partner will be stepping in the opposite direction as described traditionally in bachata the man leads so if you re a lady you can just follow in the direction of his motion whether that means stepping to the right or to the left first as your bachata skill improves and you begin dancing with partners you ll want to move away from the basic left and right bachata steps and towards a more advanced versatile step pattern that uses back and forth movements as well these back and forth movements are done almost identically to the left and right movements in other words you ll step forward three beats and pop your hips on beat four then step backward 3 beats and pop your hips on beat four lather rinse and repeat as the leading partner steps forward the following partner steps back with the corresponding foot for beginners try moving through the basic left and right bachata steps twice then doing a back and forth motion twice then switching back to the left and right motion and repeating your steps should be as follows to the left 1 2 3 4 to the right 1 2 3 4 to the left 1 2 3 4 to the right 1 2 3 4 to the front 1 2 3 4 to the back 1 2 3 4 to the front 1 2 3 4 to the back 1 2 3 4 to the left 1 2 3 4 to the right and so on note because in traditional bachata the male partner leads the to the front direction refers to his point of view the female or following partner will step back as the leading partner steps forward and vice versa one of the most essential partner moves done in bachata is the turn in the most basic variation of this move the male partner raises his arm allowing the woman to complete a full turn in time to the music then both partners return to normal dancing without missing a beat follow the instructions below to do a basic turn gentlemen as you dance mentally count out the beat 1 2 3 4 on beat 4 begin to raise your leading arm over your partner s head and begin to release your other arm s grip as a reminder in closed position the leading arm is the outstretched one rather than the one wrapped around your partner s back on beat 1 of the next measure your partner will begin to turn in a circle under your arm gently holding on to your leading arm as she does so she will finish turning on beat 3 so that on beat 4 you ll both be dancing in sync again and you ll be able to move together in the opposite direction on the next beat 1 ladies feel your partner s leading arm begin to rise on beat 4 keep holding onto your partner s leading arm but release your grip on your partner s shoulder with your other arm and move under the curve of his leading arm on beat 1 start to turn in a circle under his leading arm try to finish turning on beat 3 so that you can hit beat 4 in the normal dancing position and step together in the opposite direction on beat 1 above all else bachata is supposed to be a way for two people to have fun both men and women should try to give their partner their full attention at the simplest level this means looking at your partner while you dance not at the floor and especially not at other people you d like to dance with however this also applies to the way you dance pay attention to your partner s movements if you re leading make sure your partner is keeping up with you if you re following try to match your partner s directions and predict which way he ll go next when your partner does a glamorous move like a spin or a turn give your partner the attention s he deserves generally unless you re doing a special synchronized two person move you shouldn t do your own moves while your partner is doing his or hers bachata shouldn t be a dreary shuffle it should be an upbeat energetic dance as your bachata skill grows try to incorporate more of your body into your basic step patterns for instance rather that keeping your upper body mostly straight try moving your arms in a pumping motion and twisting slightly as you move try bending your knees and popping your hips more than you normally would for a low sensual swaying motion eventually when you re comfortable the bachata should naturally become a whole body activity at most modern dance clubs you ll encounter a casual modernized version of bachata rather than the formal traditional version this version of the dance called bachata urbana incorporates a wide variety of added moves and minor variations to give bachata an updated modern feel below are instructions for two bachata urbana moves that can give your dance routine some modern flair the slide this move is usually performed when you would normally be stepping in the opposite direction as the leading arm typically this arm is the leading partner s left arm so this means you ll do this move when you d normally step to his right to do this move mentally count the beat of the music 1 2 3 4 on beat 4 of the to the left measure the leading partner raises his leading arm so that his hand and his partner s are above their heads on beat 1 of the to the right measure he drops his leading hand to below the waist takes a big step back with his rear leg and slides backward until beat 4 the following partner mirrors his movements the male turn this move allows the leading male partner to enjoy a flashy turn for a change the male turn works especially well right after a traditional female turn so we ll assume you ve just caught your turning partner on beat 4 on beat 1 start to turn in front of your partner she doesn t need to raise her hand over you like you would while she s turning as you turn she should keep her elbows bent and her hands out in front of her this way as you turn you can grab her non leading arm with your leading arm so that for a brief moment you re both holding hands and facing the same way with your back to her front continue turning and catch her hands as you normally would on beat 3 so that on beat 4 you re dancing in sync again when two experienced bachata dancers dance with each other they re unlikely to be content with the basic left right front back steps for long as you grow as a bachata dancer for added challenge and entertainment you ll probably want to start throwing new more complex footwork patterns into your repertoire here are just a few ideas you may want to practice heel steps typically on the fourth beat of each measure you ll raise your foot slightly and roll your hips to the side instead try kicking your foot out slightly so that its heel touches the ground and its toes are raised you may need to bend your knees slightly to do this comfortably the end result should be somewhat subtle not an exaggerated cossack dance kick but slight variation on your normal step twisting instead of stepping back and forth spend a measure twisting with your partner bend your knees slightly more than usual then twist your hips and legs side to side to the beat of the music try varying between twisting twice per measure once every two beats and twisting four times per measure once every beat leg crosses this move incorporates several kicks followed by a quick turn for a dazzling effect step to the side as you normally would for three beats on beat 4 raise your leg slightly more than normal in preparation for a kick on beat 1 keeping your upper body upright gently kick out in front of you your leg should swing back on beat 2 kick out again on beat 3 then on beat four cross your kicking leg across your stationary leg and plant it on the ground use your momentum to complete a full turn on beats 1 2 and 3 of the next measure so that you re back in your normal position on beat 4

query	135	deter possums from your garden possums in the australian or new zealand garden can be a real nuisance however they are a different animal from the opossum which are the only marsupial in the northern hemisphere and require slightly different tactics to deter 1 2 if the possum takes a fancy to your fruit crop or your favorite tree the animal can completely decimate it more so than their relative in the northern hemisphere the possum native to australia and new zealand is an adept flexible and creative climber thus you will need to find creative ways to discourage them from getting into your garden eating specific plants or blocking them from your yard altogether blocking access deterring climbing applying possum sprays and deterrents living with possums know what to protect protect individual fruits and vegetables enclose garden beds block all entry points make it hard for possums to climb structures or plants trim trees that are being eaten if a possum is eating the new growth off a tree you need to figure out how to block its access to the tree put netting on fruit bushes and trees place a greased pvc pipe on top of your fence look into commercial possum sprays make and apply a quassia chip spray use household items to deter possums surround your garden with predator urine put up noisy deterrents put up scarecrows plant food for possums trap possums humanely understand that possums are protected in australia but not in new zealand possums seem to be fond of new growth on deciduous vines fruit on fruit trees and some of the new growth on pruned evergreens possums damage the plants when they eat the new growth so this needs to be prevented possums may remove all of the buds thereby weakening the plant creating bare patches and making it easier for plant diseases to take hold keep this in mind when planting new plants in your yard or when planting a garden if you plant things a possum doesn t like such as prickly and smelly plants like a tea tree or geraniums for example they are less likely to be destroyed for example there are cloth bags that are made to cover individual fruits in a tree each one can be covered separately this will stop the possums from getting to the fruit and does not interfere with the growth of the fruit you can also use old plastic plant pots with a slit down the side to protect individual fruits or vegetables place the fruit inside the pot so that it is mostly covered but can still grow instead of keeping possums out of your yard you can just try to keep them out of specific garden beds the best way to do this is to create a full enclosure out of chicken wire this may make tending your garden a little more difficult but it will assure that your plants survive possums may make their way into your eaves or other access points on your house or shed possums trying to get into your garden shed or house eaves can be deterred by covering openings with permanent covers such as pieces of wood or by using anti bird netting over any holes or entrance points just make sure that the possums are not inside the shed or eaves when you cover them as you could trap them inside if you re not sure how the possums are getting in patrol the area at dusk and watch for possums leaving their den if the possum is using a structure to get to the plant make the structure difficult to climb wrap galvanized iron sheets around posts and over beams of structures such as pergolas this will stop the possum from being able to grip the surface with its claws this also requires ensuring that there are no trees or shrubs next to the structure that allow the possum to ease itself down from you can also use a plastic garbage can with the bottom cut off and a slit up the side put it around the trunk of a tree so that the possum is unable to climb up the tree you can wrap sheet metal around the trunk of the tree to make it difficult to climb you can also place thick netting around the trunk the netting will catch the possum s feet and discourage them from climbing branches should be far enough away from fences and structures so that a possum can t jump to them this in combination with blocking access to climbing the trunk of the tree will give you the best chance of saving your tree from being decimated the good news is that while possums can jump they can t jump very far an agile young possum can jump approximately 2 5 meters from a fixed stable base but less than 2 meters from a swaying tree branch this means that trimming your trees so they are more than 2 meters from your garden fence or other structure should be sufficient in particular you should place netting over these plants while they are sending out new growth shoots or are bearing fruit the netting will not keep possums out completely but they should make it difficult enough for the possums that much of the fruit will be saved also remove any fallen fruit below fruit trees or bushes fallen fruit will attract possums to the area so keep it to a minimum if you can this method only works if your garden is closed in with fencing as it stops possums from climbing over the fence it will take about one day of your time to install this protection attach a large pvc pipe running horizontally across the top of all of the fencing this will be hard for the possum to grip onto then apply non toxic grease to the pvc pipe when a possum now tries to get into your garden you should find that it cannot get a secure grip or footing because of a the grease on the drum this causes the animal to fall off without injury make sure that there are no holes or other points for the possum to cross the fence nurseries supermarkets and some hardware stores stock a range of possum deterrent sprays that you can use remember to follow the instructions on the packaging so that your plants are not affected and so that possums the are not injured quassia is a small branching tree that contains substances that deter the possum from wanting to be around it make a spray of 100g quassia chips to 2 liters 0 5 us gal of water heat for one hour then strain add one tablespoon detergent dilute 1 part quassia solution to 4 parts water and spray on foliage most homemade sprays and applications need to be reapplied following rain they should be reapplied frequently anyway for full effectiveness these will require constant reapplication to be effective in the long term some things that you can try include brew up some lapsang souchong tea spray this over the affected plants possums don t like it spread blood and bone around the vulnerable plants use mothball flakes on beams and around the base of plants place in pantyhose and hang from foliage apply indonesian fish sauce combine one tablespoon of sauce in one litre of water and then sprayed on foliage make a garlic spray place 2 tablespoons of freshly crushed garlic into one litre of hot water leave overnight strain then spray on foliage spray laundry detergent full strength onto foliage tabasco sauce use this full strength it can painted or sprayed onto foliage note that this can badly damage some plants so do your research before applying this sauce strong smelling herbs such as sage rosemary or oregano may deter possums especially when mixed with spicy chili pepper blend to a paste and spread around affected plants urine from male foxes weasels and likely other predators has repelled possums in experiments that said it may not be completely reliable and it could attract other animals look for predator urine at a hardware store or plant nursery and follow the label instructions to distribute it in a perimeter around your garden carpet python faeces are an effective possum deterrent if available pythons are possum predators some homeowners ring their garden with human hair to deter pests but this is unproven consider trying it the next time you have a haircut scattering the trimmed hairs thinly over the surface wind chimes noisy bells or plastic bottles cut in half can catch the wind and make enough noise to keep some pests away this isn t foolproof but hopefully your fruit trees will be ready to harvest before the possums learn to ignore the noise you can also buy commercial ultrasonic pest deterrents outside the range of human hearing dogs especially outdoor dogs will chase away possums and their barking will scare them off you can try a traditional scarecrow or put up fake birds such as a tennis ball with feathers glued onto it again the effectiveness of this deterrent varies from animal to animal and may lessen over time hanging mirrors near the scarecrow may amplify the effect you may be able to steer a possum s attention away from one plant to another put plants that possums like to eat such as eucalyptus at the edge of your garden this may keep them occupied enough to keep them away from tender shoots and new growth in your garden in new zealand possums are considered an invasive species you should trap them and call animal control for removal that said possums are protected in australia the south australian government only recommends humane trapping when a possum is living in your building even then it may cause the possum less stress to lure it out then block its accessfor example you could build a nesting box place some fruit in it and then place it near where the possum is dwelling this should lure the possum into the nesting box if you do use a live trap a small amount of honey works well as bait use the trap to transfer it out of the building but not outside of the area possums almost always die when relocated possums may limit the kinds of plants you can grow in your garden but possums need human help to survive if you live in australia you can help offset the destruction of their natural environment by creating a good location for them to live including nesting boxes and attractive vegetation possums are considered invasive in new zealand call animal control or the department of conservation for assistance in removing them 
query	136	address the pope the pope is the highest earthly office of the catholic church and such an office demands respect regardless of whether you are catholic or not as such there are specific ways to address the pope both in writing and in person here s what you need to know about each one addressing the pope in writing addressing the pope in person address the pope as your holiness maintain a respectful tone conclude the letter politely know the vatican mailing address know the email address and fax number for the vatican press office refer to the pope as holy father other appropriate ways to address the pope in person include your holiness and most holy father stand and applaud as the pope enters genuflect as the pope approaches kiss his ring when appropriate speak respectfully clearly and concisely stand up as the pope leaves another acceptable way to address the pope in writing would be most holy father note however that on the envelope you should address the pope as his holiness with the pope s name in the blank for instance if writing to pope francis the envelope would read his holiness pope francis throughout the body of the letter your tone should be polite and gracious you do not need to write in flowery language but your language should be on par with how you would speak or be expected to speak inside a catholic church avoid swearing slang derogatory language or any other forms of impolite speech write out everything you need or want to say but keep in mind that the pope is a busy man instead of dragging on and spending extensive space on flattery it would be better for all parties concerned if you kept the formalities basic and went directly into the purpose of your letter as a roman catholic you should conclude the letter with a sentence along the lines of i have the honor to profess myself with the most profound respect your holiness most obedient and humble servant before signing your name if you are not a catholic you can change the closing to something along the lines of with every good wish to your holiness i am sincerely yours followed by your signature something as simple as with every best wish sincerely yours with a signature after it would also work for a non catholic writing to the pope regardless of the exact wording you choose the level of respect you demonstrate should correspond to the minimum level of respect you should have for someone in the pope s position at the very least someone who does not follow catholic teaching or who disagrees with the pope should still recognize his position of authority and close in a respectful manner anyone who does follow catholic teaching should demonstrate the respect expected from one addressing the leader of his or her faith on earth if you plan to send your letter by traditional mail you should write the address on the envelop as his holiness pope francis apostolic palace 00120 vatican city note that you should separate the address onto separate lines according to the placements of the slashes other ways to write the same address include his holiness pope francis pp 00120 via del pellegrino citta del vaticanohis holiness pope francis apostolic palace vatican cityhis holiness pope francis vatican city state 00120do not write italy on the envelop as the country the vatican is considered its own independent nation completely separate from italy if you would rather send the letter by e mail or fax you must go through the vatican press office the pope does not have a personal public e mail address or fax number the e mail address is av pccs vathe fax number is 390669885373note that neither form of contact goes directly to the pope but correspondence you have for the pope will get to him eventually when sent through either of these means his holiness and holy father both address the pope by his title and position in the church you should address the pope only by these titles rather than by his name when speaking to him face to face the amount of applause will vary depending on the venue but you should always stand in respect once the pope walks into the room you are in usually if the venue is a small room with a small to mid size crowd the applause is quiet and polite for large venues however like a stadium mass loud applause and even cheers are appropriate if the pope approaches you directly you should kneel with your right knee bent to the floor you do not need to make the sign of the cross as you would do while genuflecting to the eucharist but you should still bend at the knee genuflection is a sign of high respect if you are catholic and if the pope offers you his hand that would be an appropriate time to plant a quick yet respectful kiss on the piscatory ring also known as the ring of the fisherman traditionally worn by the pope on the other hand if the pope offers you his hand and you are not catholic you are not obligated to kiss the ring you could simply shake his hand instead the ring of the fisherman is a symbol and mark of the office by kissing it you show both respect and sincere affection for the man who holds that office plan what to say beforehand so that you do not stumble too much over your words and maintain a tone that is both clear and respectful the entire time start by introducing yourself give your name and say something important or fitting about yourself if you came to the vatican for a specific purpose or desired an audience with the pope for a specific purpose you should also state that the pope will guide the conversation and you should let him do so keep your answers direct and brief and speak in a clear loud voice so that the pope can hear you as soon as the pope stands to leave you should stand as well wait until he leaves the room before you sit down again or pay attention to anything else applause is not usually necessary at the end of the audience or event but if you are in a large crowd and the crowd begins to applaud it is appropriate to join in if you so desire 
query	137	identify mange on dogs mange is a type of inflammatory skin disease caused by tiny parasitic mites on dogs there are two basic types of mange sarcoptic and demodectic which have separate causes and symptoms it is important to be able to identify the signs of each and to understand the difference between them though mange is rarely fatal knowing how to recognize this frustrating disease early makes treating the dog much easier in the long run recognizing symptoms of mange testing for sarcoptic mange understanding the different types of mange taking initial treatment and prevention steps look for intense itching check for hair loss note the extent of bald spots or hair loss inspect your dog s feet to see if they re swollen or irritated look for patches of red irritated bumps on yourself or others in your household note that the signs of mange could also be signs of other possibly serious conditions grab hold of one of the dog s ears gently rub the ear between your fingers look for an itching motion note that the pinnal pedal reflex test does not give a definitive diagnosis of sarcoptic mange differentiate between sarcoptic and demodectic mange understand the difference between localized and generalized demodectic mange learn to look for the signs of demodectic pododermatitis as early as possible seek veterinary care clean or replace the dog s bedding collar and so on don t breed dogs with demodectic mange keep other animals away from a dog with sarcoptic mange understand the risk factors for catching sarcoptic mange sarcoptic mange usually causes frantic itching the dog may relentlessly scratch or chew at its skin to relieve the itch the dog s skin irritated from the constant scratching and biting can easily become infected the itching can even be so severe that it distracts the dog from necessary behavior like eating drinking and resting severe cases of sarcoptic mange that result in secondary infections from bacteria or yeast can cause a white crusty surface to form on the dog s irritated skin though this does not occur in all cases in addition dogs with severe secondary infections will also often suffer weight loss run a fever and or have enlarged lymph nodes localized demodectic mange the least serious variety usually results in one or two thin or bald patches in the dog s hair usually this small patch will not appear inflamed or irritated and will not cause serious itching if a case of localized demodectic mange does not go away on its own it may eventually spread to the rest of the dog s body resulting in generalized mange the dog will develop numerous thin or bald patches over its body existing patches may grow to about 1 inch 2 5 cm in diameter the skin in the patches may become red scaly and or crusty this skin irritation can cause the dog to scratch at its skin which can sometimes lead to more serious infections these secondary infections will lead to similar symptoms as those in sarcoptic mange cases fever weight loss swollen lymph nodes etc some select cases of demodectic mange cause a condition called demodectic pododermatitis this occurs when the mites that cause mange become deeply embedded in the dog s feet where they are very difficult to remove this condition most often presents itself in the form of swollen irritated feet it is usually worst around the nailbeds and often accompanied by a secondary infection one of the ways to detect a case of mange on your dog is to find mite bites on yourself when the type of mites that cause sarcoptic mange come into contact with a human they can cause red bumps similar to mosquito bites luckily these almost never become serious however seeing these symptoms after being around a dog that can t stop itching itself is a strong indication of sarcoptic mange note that humans cannot get the type of mites that cause demodectic mange itching or patchy hair loss are also symptoms of other underlying health issues such as allergies hyperadrenocorticism cushing s disease diabetes hyperthyroidism and parasite infection therefore it is important to consult your veterinarian about the problem in order to get a proper diagnosis and treatment if your dog appears to be itching itself more than normal but you re unsure whether it has sarcoptic mange this simple test can help to start take one of your dog s ears gently in your hand hold the loose floppy part of the ear between your thumb and index finger if you re worried about the possibility of getting bitten by your dog s mange causing mites you may want to wear disposable gloves for this test use your thumb and index finger to rub the dog s ear from both sides use slow steady movements and don t squeeze too tightly while you do this keep your eyes on the dog s hind leg on the same side as the ear you re rubbing you re looking for a movement in the dog s hind leg like it s trying to reach up to scratch its ear if you see this your dog may have sarcoptic mange in this case you should wash your hands and take the dog to a veterinarian at your earliest convenience this test called the pinnal pedal reflex test works because in the vast majority of sarcoptic mange cases mites are present in and around the dog s ears when you rub the dog s ear it feels the irritating itching sensation caused by the mites and tries to scratch itself while the test does confirm your dog is itchy and sensitized it does not confirm the cause sarcoptic mange can be very difficult to definitively diagnose the pinnal pedal test may lead to a presumptive diagnosis of scabies in which case treatment should begin as soon as possible if your dog responds to the therapy promptly that is considered confirmation of the diagnosis dogs can contract two forms of mange sarcoptic mange and demodectic mange though both can be serious the two forms of the disease differ somewhat in the symptoms they present see part 1 and have different causes sarcoptic mange is an infection by a specific kind of mite that is passed along from other infected animals demodectic mange is caused by a different kind of mite that is normally present in a dog s skin while most dogs live in harmony with these mites sometimes the mites can proliferate and cause hair loss and irritation although both sarcoptic and generalized demodectic mange can lead to itching it s important to distinguish the two the mites that cause sarcoptic mange lead to immediate severe itching while the mites that cause demodectic mange cause patches of irritated skin to develop which then may become itchy while sarcoptic mange itself can t kill a dog the dog s health can deteriorate quickly if it gets a serious infection or stops eating or sleeping so in this case immediate veterinary care may be needed this should be obvious a dog with a bad case of sarcoptic mange will appear profoundly unhealthy sarcoptic mange is sometimes referred to as scabies demodectic mange may also be called demodex localized demodectic mange is characterized by hair loss in one or two spots if unresolved possibly because of suppressed immunity allergies or endocrine issues the condition may spread resulting in a proliferation of bald patches that may become irritated and infected which lead to itching and scabbing localized demodectic mange is most common in puppies in about 90 of cases localized demodectic mange disappears on its own without treatment in a month or two however in a fraction of cases the disease may develop into the more serious generalized demodectic mange while dogs do not inherit demodectic mange per se is thought that those that develop generalized demodectic mange usually inherit their weakness to the disease genetically pododermatitis is a third type of demodectic mange in some cases the dog may have the classic symptoms of demodectic mange while others may have foot infections only treatment of pododermatitis can be long and complicated often involving administering antibiotics and frequently dipping the dog s feet in a medication called mitaban because treatment is difficult spotting this condition early is critical if you think your dog has any sort of mange you should consult your veterinarian only a trained experienced vet can run the proper diagnostic tests to determine the type and severity of the mange depending on the diagnosis the vet will then prescribe the proper medication to treat the mange because mange is almost always easiest to treat before it becomes severe seeing your vet as quickly as possible is important to ensure your pet is back to normal as soon as possible cases of sarcoptic mange require a veterinarian more urgently than demodectic mange because the severe itching from sarcoptic mange can make a dog miserable and more importantly quickly lead to health problems early diagnosis and treatment is essential the exception to this general rule is for very minor cases of localized demodectic mange because these usually clear up on their own a veterinarian is not always necessary though you may want to consult with one for peace of mind anyway and to rule out other conditions in cases of mange especially sarcoptic mange which is contagious any objects that have recently come into contact with the dog s hair or skin should immediately be washed or replaced this includes its bedding collar leash harness doghouse and any brushes or cleaning products the need for cleaning is especially urgent if you have other pets who don t have mange yet for fabric objects launder with bleach or borax and dry at the highest possible setting for hard objects and surfaces use a hospital grade disinfectant repeat daily as needed until the mange subsides as noted above dogs who get bad cases of demodectic mange sometimes have a weakness in their immune system that they ve inherited from their parents because of this owners of dogs that have had long severe or difficult to treat cases of demodectic mange are usually encouraged not to breed their dogs for dogs that have had minor localized cases of demodectic mange breeding is sometimes considered acceptable especially if the mange occurred when the dog was young and cleared up on its own it s worth noting however that some veterinarians will recommend against breeding dogs that have had any sort of demodectic mange if you re unsure of whether it s wise to breed your dog talk to a vet who knows you and your dog for advice usually a vet like this will be able to recommend a course of action that takes your needs into account as well as the health of any future puppies because sarcoptic mange is highly contagious quarantine is essential for making sure that other pets and animals don t catch the aggravating disease if your dog has sarcoptic mange immediately separate it from other animals don t let it sleep feed or play near them if you think a neighbor s dog has sarcoptic mange don t let your own pets go near it once the mange has completely disappeared the dog may be allowed to mingle with other animals as normal note that no form of demodectic mange is thought to be contagious to other animals or humans in very rare cases the disease may be contagious to other dogs however quarantine measures usually aren t taken even when symptoms are severe sarcoptic mange is highly contagious and usually passed from one infected dog to another often the infected dog shows few if any signs of the disease sarcoptic mange may be passed from a mother to her puppies and is common in overcrowded conditions where dogs are poorly maintained such as puppy mills boarding kennels and shelters however a dog might be exposed to mites even if it doesn t come into contact with a mangy animal mites can survive four to 21 days away from their host in temperatures between 50 59 f 10 15 c and two to six days in temperatures of 68 77 f 20 25 c a dog could catch mange from an object that has recently been used on an infected animal such as a blanket or towel likewise if grooming salons do not practice regular sanitation of clippers towels and caging this could also lead to the spread of the disease since wild animals like coyotes and foxes can also get sarcoptic mange exercising in wildlife areas may also expose your dog to scabies

with an otoscope a lighted instrument for inspecting ears you may also undergo a hearing test potentially some imaging tests such as an mri or a ct scan in some cases more extensive tests may be necessary in general these tests are not invasive or painful but may cause some discomfort you may experience changes in the bones of the inner ear that can be genetically based the inner ear includes three very small bones the malleus the incus and the stapes these three bones are connected to each other and to the eardrum tympanic membrane they are also connected to the structures that translate sound vibrations into nerve impulses that we perceive as sound if these bones are not able to move freely because of otosclerosis tinnitus can result you may also have excessive earwax which can cause tinnitus unfortunately many times the exact cause of tinnitus cannot be determined many times it may simply be due to aging such as the following conditions age related hearing loss presbycusis menopause tinnitus is one of the rarer symptoms of menopause and it may be actually due to age rather than the menopausal transition often the tinnitus disappears along with other menopausal issues

some success these include antidepressants and antianxiety drugs these however are also associated with a number of side effects including dry mouth blurry vision constipation heart problems drowsiness and nausea hearing aids may be useful for some people your physician might recommend a hearing aid after you have been examined by a licensed audiologist according to the american tinnitus association hearing loss causes less external sound stimuli to reach the brain in response the brain undergoes neuroplastic changes in how it processes different sound frequencies tinnitus is the product of these maladaptive neuroplastic changes essentially this means that with progressive hearing loss the brain tries to adapt but sometimes that adaptation doesn t work and tinnitus is the result in general the hearing loss is often at and above the frequency of the tinnitus itself mask the noise in your ears by turning on background music or other sounds you can use tapes or cds with white noise of the ocean a babbling brook rainfall soft music or whatever works to help block out and cover up the sounds in your ears white noise or other soothing sounds can also be used to help you sleep this can be important as many people find it difficult to sleep with tinnitus at night the sound in your ears can become the only sound audible and can make it hard to fall asleep background noise can serve to provide a peaceful sound to help you sleep brown noise is a collection of randomly generated sounds and is generally perceived as much deeper sounds than white noise pink noise uses lower frequencies and is also perceived as deeper sounds than white noise either pink or brown noise is often recommended to help with sleep find examples online of both pink and brown noise choose the noise that sounds best to you one of the most common triggers for tinnitus is the presence of loud noises avoid these as much as possible some people may not be affected by loud noises but if you do experience worsening or aggravated tinnitus after hearing loud noises you ll know that this may be a trigger for you a german study involving music therapy in tinnitus showed that music therapy employed in early cases of tinnitus can prevent that tinnitus turns into a chronic condition this therapy involves listening to your favorite music with its frequency altered to center on the same frequency as the ringing in your ears temporomandibular joint tmj problems which can cause tinnitus can be successfully treated with chiropractic approaches tmj problems are thought to promote tinnitus because of the proximity of muscles and ligaments that attach to the jaw and the hearing bones a chiropractic treatment would consist of manual manipulation in order to re align the tmj the chiropractor might also manipulate the vertebrae of the neck in order to decrease the symptoms of tinnitus chiropractic adjustments are not painful but they may cause some temporary discomfort the chiropractic treatment may also include the application of heat or ice and specific exercises chiropractic treatments can also help with meniere s disease another relatively rarer cause of tinnitus a recent review of studies of the success of acupuncture for tinnitus concluded that there was some cause for hope acupuncture techniques would vary based on the underlying cause for the tinnitus these techniques also often include traditional chinese herbs more studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture on improving tinnitus aldosterone is a hormone found in the adrenal gland that regulates sodium and potassium in the blood one study found a tinnitus patient with hearing loss to have an aldosterone deficiency when the patient received bioidentical aldosterone the patient s hearing was restored and the tinnitus went away there is a relatively new approach that may be useful for some the idea is to find the frequency of the particular sound in your ears and masking that specific frequency with specially designed sounds your ent or audiologist may have recommendations about these treatments you may also find these treatments available online for a fee through websites such as audionotch and tinnitracks these services walk you through testing for the specific frequency of your tinnitus and design a treatment protocol there have been limited studies on this approach but they do appear promising your body uses coq10 or coenzyme q10 for cell growth and maintenance it is also an antioxidant coq10 can also be found in organ meats such as heart liver and kidney one study indicated that coq10 supplements could be helpful for some patients with a low serum level of coq10 try taking 100 mg three times a day ginkgo biloba is believed to increase blood flow to the brain and has been used to treat tinnitus with variable results this is likely because tinnitus has many known and unknown causes a recent review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the use of ginkgo biloba to treat tinnitus another recent report on the other hand concluded that a standardized extract of ginkgo egb 761 was an effective treatment egb 761 is a standardised extract of ginkgo biloba leaves and has antioxidant properties as a free radical scavenger a standardised extract of ginkgo biloba leaves is a well defined product and contains approximately 24 flavone glycosides primarily quercetin kaempferol and isorhamnetin and 6 terpene lactones 2 8 3 4 ginkgolides a b and c and 2 6 3 2 bilobalide commercially this particular supplement is sold as tebonin egb 761 follow manufacturer s instructions if taking this supplement in one study almost half of tinnitus patients improved with 50 milligrams mg of zinc daily for 2 months this is actually a rather high dose of zinc the recommended daily intake of adult males is 11 mg and for females the recommended dose is 8 mg don t take this amount of zinc without talking to a knowledgeable healthcare professional first if you do take this high amount of zinc don t take it longer than 2 months balance your intake of zinc with copper supplements a high intake of zinc is associated with copper deficiency and copper deficiency anemias and taking the extra copper will help prevent that take 2 mg of copper every day melatonin is a hormone that is involved in the sleep cycle one study indicated that 3 mg of melatonin taken at night was most effective in men without a history of depression and those with tinnitus in both ears it is generally recommended to avoid salty foods because of their association with high blood pressure which can cause tinnitus a reasonable recommendation is to eat a healthy whole foods diet low in added salt sugar and saturated fats and to increase the amounts of fruit and vegetables in the diet some of the most common triggers for tinnitus include coffee alcohol and nicotine avoid any and all of these as much as possible we don t really know why these are triggers for different people because tinnitus is a symptom of a number of different possible problems the reason these are triggers may vary on an individual basis cutting out these substances may not improve your tinnitus in fact one study showed that caffeine was not associated with tinnitus at all another study indicated that alcohol may actually help relieve tinnitus in older adults at a minimum watch what happens if you have any coffee alcohol or nicotine especially being aware of what happens to your tinnitus after you indulge in any of these if the tinnitus gets worse or harder to deal with you may want to consider avoiding those triggers completely cognitive behavioral therapy cbt is an approach that uses techniques such as cognitive restructuring and relaxation to change a person s response to tinnitus tinnitus retraining therapy is a complementary practice that helps desensitize you to the noise in your ears the therapist will teach you different ways to cope with the noise this is a process in cbt known as habituation where you can learn to ignore the tinnitus the therapist will teach you about your tinnitus and will teach you a variety of relaxation techniques this person will help you adopt a realistic effective attitude in dealing with tinnitus a recent review of the technique indicated that it didn t affect the level of noise but it positively affected how the individual responded to the noise the response after cbt included less depression and anxiety with higher reported levels of satisfaction with life a recent large review of therapeutic approaches to tinnitus determined that a combination of sound therapy background noise plus cbt provided the best overall results another study reviewed nine high quality studies evaluating the efficacy of tinnitus retraining therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy in each study a variety of standardized and validated questionnaires was used the investigators found that both tinnitus retraining therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy were equally effective in relieving the symptoms of tinnitus you might find it useful to find a tinnitus support group especially if you are experiencing depression or anxiety associated with the tinnitus this support group can help you develop tools to cope with your condition anxiety and depression can be associated with tinnitus and vice versa if you are experiencing these symptoms make sure you seek out professional help usually depression and anxiety exist before the tinnitus but these conditions can follow the onset of tinnitus the sooner you get treatment for tinnitus anxiety and or depression the sooner you can begin to feel and function better tinnitus can also make concentrating difficult this is where cognitive behavioral therapy can be very useful providing different tools and resources to cope

self help guru martha beck uses this phrase to describe the fear that can keep you from trying out new things practice mindfulness be patient with yourself rekindle a childhood passion combine your talents turn a beloved hobby into a full time passion do the thing you ve always dreamed about try a new sport explore your artistic side pick up a new hobby get out of your comfort zone travel volunteer in your community try new things with the help of others do your research avoid jumping into a new job just on instinct commit to leaving when it just feels wrong many people often end up listening too much to their social selves the part of your personality that wants to fit in be thought of well by others and follow rules while it s healthy to want to be part of a larger community if you end up basing all your decisions on what other people think is right for you you ll end up feeling like you ve missed your purpose this can happen at any time in your life but you may be especially vulnerable when you re younger because you may feel compelled to listen to your parents or other authority figures stop shoulding yourself this phrase comes from psychologist clayton barbeau who coined the idea to describe what happens when you let external pressures shape what you think you should do this can make you feel unhappy and dissatisfied with your choices because they are coming from a place of guilt and fear rather than choice try thinking about what you want to do not what you feel you should do because someone else has told you that you should do it passion comes from authenticity feeling like you re honoring yourself in your decisions rather than trying to be or satisfy someone else this is highly personal and no one else can tell you what feels authentic to you only you can decide that your values are your core beliefs in life they can be religious or spiritual but they can also be reflective of your personality and what most satisfies you research has shown that when you aren t living in accordance with your values you can feel unhappy and unmotivated you may also procrastinate more because you don t find your activities meaningful it can be difficult to figure out what you value in life if you ve never given it much thought or if others needs and desires have always taken priority over your own take some time to examine your past experiences and think about what made you feel right about your life many people have never sat down to really figure out what their values are take some time for yourself and ask yourself what things feel right to you and what activities do not feel right to you think about times when you felt happiest what were you doing back then who were you with why do you think that event or situation contributed to your feeling of happiness what can you do to bring that feeling into other areas of your life think about times when you felt fulfilled and satisfied what needs or desires were fulfilled what was meaningful about this time or experience to you why do you think that was so are there any topics that get you fired up when you think or talk about them what do you think affects you about these topics consider what you would save if your house was on fire and all your people and pets were already safe what meaning do those items have to you what does that say about what s important to you if you could change just one thing about your family community workplace neighborhood or even the world what would you change and why would you change it once you ve thought about your answers to the questions and even come up with your own questions if you like examine your answers what appears to make you happy and to add purpose to your life what is not as satisfying as you thought have a look at the list of common values at mindtools to help you figure things out for example perhaps you remember feeling proud of yourself when you had accomplished something on your own this suggests possible values like independence self reliance and ambition you might also have felt most fulfilled when you were able to express yourself through your artwork this suggests possible values like creativity exploration and vision perhaps you felt the happiest when you were able to help your children with their homework or help a neighbor with their yardwork this suggests possible values like support community and contributing positively to society remember that your values are yours don t judge them by anyone else s standards some people value spontaneity or competitiveness others value structure or teamwork neither is better than the other take a look at your life and see if you re already doing something that you love but just not doing it very often figuring out what you really love to do and channeling it in a productive way that turns it into a passion can help you explore your heart s desires here are some of the things to ask yourself what are my goals what do i do most of the time what do i keep on trying to do what draws me if i could do one thing for the rest of my life what would it be what do i love to do what would i do even if i didn t get paid to do it what makes me feel like nothing else exists what activity makes me feel completely in my element what am i doing when i feel right or beautiful or connected this is different from making a list of all of the things that make you happy you will have to write down all of those things you ve always dreamed about but haven t done because you don t have the time the money or because they re impractical or even slightly scary here are some questions to ask yourself what is the one thing i have always dreamed about but never got to do what did i want to do when i was a child do i have an impractical dream that i once abandoned what do i love reading or daydreaming about is there something i ve been afraid to try because it takes me out of my comfort zone is there something i ve been wanting to do but haven t done because of financial fears is there something i ve always wanted to do but haven t tried because i ve been afraid i d fail or just not be very good at it is there something that someone i know does that thrills me what would i do if i had no constraints a vision board also called a dream board or a creativity board can be a helpful way to prompt your passions some people are more visual thinkers and respond well to collecting things that represent meaningful ideas collect images and inspiring quotes that represent what is meaningful to you who do you want to be what do you want out of your life what do you want to create or make you can also make a virtual vision board on a site like pinterest life is about compromise you will not have the time or energy to do everything but it is important to decide what your priorities are figuring out what you value most in life will save you the frustration of trying to have everything which just isn t feasible is it important that you are passionate about your career you may have to sacrifice in other areas of your life such as hobbies or even financial security is it important to you to have the money to pursue a passion for travel or another hobby you may have to take a solid well paying but less exciting job to pay for it be as specific as possible happiness and success are too vague to be helpful try to use your reflection on your values and enjoyments as a guide to figuring out what makes you happy regardless of the trade offs and compromises you make you will feel more satisfied and therefore more passionate when you are in control of your choices no one s expectations of you are behind the wheel but you are this can be a huge goal such as find a new job or a smaller goal such as take an art class to help you set a goal that you re likely to accomplish consider the following who is responsible for achieving this goal most of the time this will be you but if your goal includes others such as spend more time with my family they ll also be responsible for accomplishing it what are the details of your goal one of the reasons people don t accomplish their goals is because they re too vague be as concrete as possible for example learn to be artistic is too big take a painting class to explore my artistic side is more manageable when will you have each step of the goal accomplished many goals especially big or complex ones need multiple stages figure out exactly when you will have each step finished for example look for art classes in my community this week sign up for a class and buy supplies next week begin taking classes the week after that where will these goals take place for many goals such as exercise more having an idea of where you will do the work can be helpful for example if you want to exercise three times per week decide whether you want to go to the gym go running exercise at home or take a class how will you accomplish each stage this helps you define the goal s framework for example if your goal is go to france figure out what actions you will need to take at each stage such as look at travel guides and websites talk with friends who ve been to france book reservations get a passport etc why are you doing this clarifying your motivation makes you more likely to accomplish your goal what will accomplishing this goal do to help you achieve your passion the yeah is the excitement or inspiration that drives you to seek your passion the but is the intrusion of fear that keeps you from pursuing it the next time you find yourself thinking yeah traveling the world building a birdhouse finding a new job would be great but stop right there ask yourself is the but or the obstacle or roadblock really something you can t overcome or will it just take a little creativity to work around for example your goal might be i d love to travel the world but i don t have the money this may seem like an impossible obstacle but there are ways to work around it save up the money with your goal in mind sell all your belongings and use the profits to go hitchhike and rely on the kindness of strangers there are always ways to do what is important to you one of the biggest things that can kill a pursuit of your passion is fear when fear drives your decisions you don t take risks or allow yourself to be vulnerable vulnerability and openness are key to connecting both with yourself and with others fearfulness often happens when you focus so much on what could happen that you don t accept what s happening right now practicing mindfulness can help you with this practice naming your fear don t judge it just acknowledge whatever it is you re feeling at the moment for example i m feeling scared of taking this risk because it might not work out then comfort yourself with a few self affirmations such as i cannot control how things work out i can only control my own actions don t try to repress your fear repressing an emotion will only make it reappear stronger instead try sitting with your emotion for the moment explore how it feels be kind to yourself and remind yourself that it s natural to feel all emotions including being afraid try mindfulness meditation mindfulness meditation can help you explore your feelings without judging them which can help you work past your feelings of fear ucla offers free downloadable mp3 guided meditations you can also find free videos and tutorials at the harvard pilgrim website finding your passion means experimenting and experimenting can take time you may have to try a several ideas before you find one that clicks with you many people fail to find their passion because they don t stick with the search when it gets tough accept that you may hit roadblocks and challenges along the way that s okay treat every challenge as a learning experience when you truly find your passion you will have amassed a wealth of experience and education from having pursued it be kind to yourself too some people may judge your passion they may think it s silly ignorant unwise or just boring don t let anyone else s criticism stand in your way as your passion is yours you don t owe anyone but yourself an explanation for your choices you may feel like your life has become too routine or boring for you to have time for dreams and passions but there must have been a point in your life when you had a real dream to pursue something courageous and exciting think back to your childhood self and the things you used to dream about doing when you were a kid or even an adolescent see if you can find a way to reconnect with these passions if you always wanted to be an astronaut then maybe this idea doesn t appeal to you quite as much anymore think about why the idea appealed to you in the first place maybe because it involved exploring space science or adventure and see if you can find a new passion out of that be brave if you wanted to be a singer or an actress it s never too late to try to fulfill your dreams unfortunately you may have to take a practical approach in some cases if you wanted to be an olympic gymnast when you were ten and you re forty now it s unlikely that there s a gold medal in your future if you were once really passionate about gymnastics see if you can involve yourself in it in some other way such as being a trainer coach or being involved at a gym in some capacity if you were lucky enough to keep a journal when you were younger go through it see what passions sparked your fancy and what dreams you wrote about again and again maybe you have more than one talent perhaps you re really great at bmx stunts and you love to write could you see yourself writing books on bmx riding and tricks or true stories about how those riders started out doing what they love here are a few other ways to combine your talent maybe you love to write poetry as well as interpretive dance could you interpret one of your poems or write a poem about your love for dance if you re a talented writer make the most of your writing skills if you love something blogging about it or making a website about it will help you share your passion use your writing skills and develop your love for what you re doing if you have a passion for languages and an unrelated field such as eco business see if you can use your language skills to work as a translator or interpreter in that field if there s already something in your life that fills you with excitement joy and self worth why not try turning that hobby or activity into a full time endeavor though it may scare you to make a big life change if you know there s something you already love spend more time pursuing it to see if it s your passion your hobby could be anything from ceramics painting or poetry to teaching yoga or screen printing if you can t make money with your passion like running marathons for example then you can find a way to make that hobby the central passion of your life by getting involved in the running world in some other way you can transition slowly into spending more time doing your favorite hobby to see if it s your passion if you re afraid to drop everything and devote yourself to this hobby full time then take baby steps remember that you are not required to do something for a living to make it your passion if you love marathons but can t find a way to turn them into a career just train and run no matter how gutsy risky or impractical that thing may be you should work hard to make your dream a reality who knows maybe you ll try salsa dancing and will realize it s not the thing for you or you ll travel to the galapagos islands and will feel uninspired however it is more likely that by being brave and doing the thing you ve always dreamed about you ll be lighting that spark that ignites you be determined to pursue your dream in spite of practical and financial constraints make a plan that allows you to try your dream out even if it s only for a little while it could take a while to save up to pursue this dream or to make the proper arrangements but it will be worth it if you re afraid to try the new thing like climbing to the top of a mountain ask your friends for their support you don t have to try something new and scary alone start talking about what you re going to do before you do it if you really wanted to build your own treehouse start telling everyone about it this will get you closer to making your dreams a reality you ll be less likely to back down if everyone knows you want to pursue your dreams you may not know it but your true passion could be mountain biking or archery though you may think you only like to go jogging once in a while you ll never know what your true passion is until you try trying a new sport will get your

your new discovery before leaving the stability of your old job everyone can be passionate about something new and exciting for a few days when you discover the unpleasant or even dull aspects of your new discovery and still love it that s when you know it s right for you for example becoming a chef might seem like the ideal career for you but it s easy to glamorize something when you re not living in it day to day taking a culinary class or even enrolling in culinary school will familiarize you with the nitty gritty details such as the insanely long hours hot kitchens and generally low pay once you know the worst about your new interest and still can t imagine yourself doing anything else you can feel confident that you ve found a real passion if you feel stuck at a dead end job that fulfills none of your needs except paying the rent every month commit to finding something else you may even find that quitting before you ve found another job motivates you to work harder this is because of a little something called the zone of optimal anxiety a psychological phenomenon where being in an unfamiliar situation causes just enough anxiety to make you work harder and think more creatively be aware however that too much stress is as bad for your performance as too little if you leave your unfulfilling job without any savings or other ideas and have a mortgage student loans and your kid s tuition to cover you might find yourself overwhelmed with so much stress that you can t function 
query	143	decode a vin a vin or vehicle identification number is a unique string of letters and numbers assigned to each vehicle manufactured although they have been around since 1954 these steps will work best on vehicles made since 1981 when an international standard system was created vins can tell you when and where a car was made which model of engine or transmission it came with and other

vin is real or fake locate the vin on your car to start the decoding process find detailed information quickly by entering the entire vin online use a service to check whether your vehicle has a history of damage use the other methods to decode it yourself use the first character to discover the continent of manufacture use the first two characters to narrow it down to country and manufacturer use the tenth character to determine the model year acquire your car company s decoding sheet use the third character to determine the type of vehicle or the company division use characters 4 through 8 to decode information on component types use the 11th character to discover the exact assembly plant use the 12th through 17th digits to find the serial number or miscellaneous information use an online vin calculator to quickly confirm the vin is real understand the purpose of the 9th character replace each letter with a number according to the information below write out the new 17 digit number write out the following line of numbers underneath one number below each digit 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 10 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 multiply each column of numbers add each number in your final list together divide the result by 11 and write down the remainder check the 9th digit of the original vin you ll need to find a long serial number usually 17 digits marked somewhere on your car or truck it may be in one of several locations you can read the wikihow article on how to find your vin vehicle identification number or look in the common locations listed below look on the dash at the base of the windshield on the driver s side for a small plaque look for a sticker on the driver s door a vin may also be found in the front of the engine block easily visible once you open the hood on most newer vehicles some body parts such as fenders and hoods also have the vin on them for identification and matching parts to the vehicle open the driver side door and look at the where the side view mirror would be located if the door were shut older cars may have vins found elsewhere such as on the steering column radiator support bracket or the left side inner wheel arch you can find websites that can decode the vin of most manufacturers automatically try vin decoder net if you re looking for detailed quickly accessible information you can try to find a vin lookup on your car manufacturer s web site but it s not guaranteed to have one if your vehicle was manufactured before 1980 it might have a nonstandard vin if free lookup websites don t work try a paid service such as carfax autocheck or vinaudit these should give you a little information for free but a full vin decoding will cost money specialized vin websites and vin lookup services exist to see whether your vehicle was involved in an accident fire or other damaging situation you cannot decode this information from a vin yourself since the vin for a vehicle never changes these services just take advantage of the fact that police and other organizations use the unique vin to describe a car in accident reports first try the free service at the national insurance crime bureau website if you cannot get information for free online you may need to pay for a vehicle history report this should be included in the vin report services described earlier such as vinaudit s follow the methods below instead if you want to have fun decoding it yourself or if your vehicle was made by an unusual manufacturer not decodable by a website finding out where and when your car was made should be easy while the other methods may take extra effort these codes are fully standardized in north america elsewhere in the world most major manufacturers follow the same standards but they may use the 9th and 10th characters for different purposes in north america the 9th must be used as checking code to confirm the vin is real and the 10th must be used to indicate the year the car was made you can skip straight to the next step to find which country it is made in but this basic information is easy to check and remember if the first character is an a b c d e f g or h the vehicle was made in africa j k l m n p or r as the first character means the vehicle was made in asia this includes the middle east note that a vin never begins with a zero or o due to the ease of confusing these two symbols s t u v w x y or z indicate europe 1 2 3 4 or 5 indicate north america including usa mexico and canada 6 or 7 indicate australia or new zealand note that nearby nations such as indonesia or the philippines are considered part of asia for this purpose 8 or 9 indicate south america many vehicles are made in a different country than the one the manufacturing company is located in compare the first two characters of the vin to an online chart like this one including the first continent code described above and find out where a vehicle was really made this will also tell you which company made the car some companies use the third digit as well to indicate manufacturer or company division the first two digits should be enough to identify the country and company however this method will always work for north american cars and will often work for cars from other regions note that this might be one year later than the car was actually made a model year of 2008 means the car was probably made either in 2007 or 2008 see below for decoding instructions a 10th character which is an a b c d e f g or h indicate the years 1980 1987 in alphabetical order or the years 2010 2017 j k l m and n are reserved for model years 1988 1992 or 2018 2022 p means the model year is 1993 or 2023 r s and t mean 1994 1996 or 2024 2026 v w x and y mean 1997 2000 or 2027 2030 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 indicate the years 2001 2009 or 2031 2039 a real vin never contains the letters i o or q the year code has additional restrictions never using the number 0 or the letters u or z if you re not sure whether your car is new or old check the vehicle s 7th character if this is a number your vehicle s model year is earlier than 2010 if the 7th character is a letter the model year is 2010 or later until 2039 for all additional information such as the make of engine or the exact assembly plant that made the vehicle you ll need to know the internal system that car manufacturer uses if you don t know the car manufacturer you can look it up based on the second character look up the most common manufacturer s code online try to find a vin lookup service or the vin decoding sheets on your car manufacturer s website failing that use a search engine to look for vin decoding sheet name of company this may be difficult or impossible for some manufacturers contact the company s support service if they have one and ask about vin decoding specific to their cars ask an auto service shop if you can see their decoding charts the workers there use the charts to direct the repairs and adjustments they make depending on the manufacturer the third character of your vin is used either to narrow down the location further to a company division or to describe the vehicle s type most of the time this character simply means car or truck or provides little information that the country code doesn t for instance made by honda canada these make up the vehicle description system or vds according to specific company codes they describe the vehicle s engine and transmission types exact model and similar information technically the 9th character is also considered part of the vds section but is used to confirm the vin is real not to describe a component if you want to know exactly which factory was used to make your car the 11th digit will tell you just like everything else in this section you ll need to find that company s system to find out more see the beginning of this section for more details on how to accomplish that each manufacturer can decide how to use this space for their own purposes most commonly this is a single 6 digit number that tells you the vehicle s serial number some manufacturers never repeat serial numbers while others start again at 000001 each year the 10th through 17th digits are referred to as the vehicle identification section use a search engine to find one and enter your full vin remember to use capital letters follow the instructions below if you want to calculate it yourself instead shady used car salesmen sometimes replace vin stickers to hide a history of damage using an online calculator can quickly confirm whether it s a lazy fake but a smart criminal will use a real sticker from a similar model this is where you can compare the vin in the door to the vin on the dash or on other body components to see if major components have been replaced with used parts or mismatched parts indicating wrecks or rebuilds the 9th character is a check character mandatory in north america but commonly used elsewhere in the world as well this character can be used in a mathematical calculation to determine whether the vin is fake and has no other purpose note the check character will always be a number or the letter x if it is a different letter either the vin was fake the car was made before 1980 and uses a different standard or the car was made outside north america and unusually the makers decided not to follow the check digit standard write down the 9th character now to check at the end of the calculation or find it again afterward the first step involves replacing each letter in your vin with a number that can be used in a calculation use the following system and keep the characters in the same order as you replace them for instance if your vin begins ak6 you should rewrite it as 126 a and j become 1b k and s become 2c l and t become 3d m and u become 4e n and v become 5f and w become 6g p and x become 7h and y become 8r and z become 9if there is an i o or a q in your vin it is fake real vins never use these letters due to how easy it is to mistake them for a number you can skip the rest of this method as you already know the vin isn t real leave plenty of space between each digit as well as below the number consider turning a sheet of paper sideways so you have the room to write it in one line keep the exact order listed note that 10 is one number and should only go below a single digit each digit in the top row will be multiplied by the number directly beneath it write the results of each problem separately do not turn them into one long number here s an example a fake vin with letters turned into numbers as described above 4 2 3 2 2 6 3 4 2 2 6 3 2 0 0 0 1the series of numbers to multiply 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 10 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2multiply 4 x 8 the first number in each line to get 32 multiple 2 x 7 the second number to get 14 continue until you get the following results 32 14 18 10 8 18 6 40 0 18 48 21 12 0 0 0 2 add every number you got from the multiplication step together to get one number continuing the example above we get 32 14 18 10 8 18 6 40 0 18 48 21 12 0 0 0 2 247 don t calculate this division problem out to the decimal point only to the whole number you can use a calculator long division or work it out in your head note if the remainder is 10 write down an x instead using the example above 247 11 22 remainder 5 write down 5 if you re using a calculator that gives you the answers in decimals and you re not sure how to find the remainder use an online remainder caculator instead if this is the same as the remainder you wrote down the vin is real otherwise the vin is probably fake the vin is definitely fake in this case if the car it belongs to was made in north america after 1980 note that if the remainder is 10 the matching 9th digit of a real vin will be x since the manufacturer can t use a two digit number 10 as a checking number in our example above the fifth digit of the original vin is 2 but our remainder is 5 these numbers are not the same so the vin must be fake 
query	144	caulk baseboards caulk is a watertight sealant used to protect the joints and seams in a house from damage and wear though often used to seal the gaps around doors windows and other home fixtures caulk can also be used along the edges of your floor to seal the gap between the wall and baseboard in addition to giving your room a professional finished appearance this also protects against water damage and daily wear and tear by choosing the right tools doing proper prep work and caulking carefully it s easy to give your baseboard a durable professional sealing choosing your caulk and caulking gun preparing your work area caulking the baseboards caulking safely finishing the job deciding whether caulking is right for you use latex caulk for delicate indoor jobs use acrylic latex caulk for long term projects use silicone caulk for tough jobs and extreme temperatures don t mix different types of caulk use a caulking gun for large projects and tubes for small ones clean your floor and baseboards keep the area free of obstructions have water or a household cleaner and several rags handy lay down masking tape before beginning to caulk cut a hole into your caulk cartridge s point pierce the cartridge s inner membrane load a cartridge into your caulking gun if inexperienced with a caulk gun practice first caulk the tops of the baseboards smooth the caulk with your finger caulk the bottoms of the baseboards pull your masking tape before the caulk dries ensure proper ventilation wear gloves if desired handle knives with care don t eat or inhale caulk protect the caulk while it sets fix any minor errors by hand clean up understand where caulking is appropriate understand the time commitment of caulking understand the costs associated with caulking one aspect of caulking that can be confusing to first timers is the fact that multiple types of caulk exist for seemingly the same job however different types of caulk have different strengths and weaknesses which can make some varieties more appropriate for certain jobs than others for instance latex caulk is a type of caulk which is great for indoor projects it has a low odor which is important when ventilation is limited it also has great expansion properties can be easily cleaned up with water and even comes in a variety of colors finally latex caulk can be painted when it s dry allowing you to make it practically invisible however latex caulk doesn t quite have the durability of other varieties which can be a problem if it s exposed to widely varying temperatures severe weather and heavy wear as you may expect from its name acrylic latex caulk is a type of caulk that s made from latex combined with acrylic resins this variety has all the strengths of latex caulk listed above however because of its acrylic properties this caulk is more flexible and durable than ordinary latex caulk making it a great choice for indoor situations in which it will be exposed to a high degree of wear and tear the sturdiest variety of caulk which uses a silicone base can be a pain to apply but is suitable for the harshest conditions silicone caulk s toughness makes it great for situations in which it is exposed to widely ranging temperatures harsh weather conditions and heavy wear for durable all weather protection silicone chalk has no substitute however silicone caulk has several disadvantages it can t be painted which means you may be stuck with its default clear appearance it also is difficult to clean up with water making spills and drips during the application process into serious headaches finally it has a strong odor before drying which makes good ventilation a must when applying the caulk though it may seem like combining different varieties of caulk like acrylic latex and silicone for instance might give you the strengths of each in fact doing so will simply give you a caulk that won t do its job each variety of caulk is specially formulated to work on its own mixing one type of caulk with another can leave you with a substance that may not bind to your surfaces set or provide proper protection for baseboard caulking where protection against water damage is a serious concern you ll always want to use only one type of caulk at a time if you re tackling a relatively small simple project like for instance caulking your baseboards at the point that they meet a bathtub you can usually get away with buying and using small tubes of caulk which allow you to squeeze caulk out like toothpaste for easy application for larger projects you ll want to use a caulking gun and compatible caulking cartridges which are much quicker though it can take some time to get used to them they re ultimately the more efficient option for large jobs most caulking guns are quite cheap costing around 10 20 or less caulk is tremendously sticky stuff it s liable to bind to any loose object it touches because of this it s very important to ensure that both your wall and your baseboard are clean before caulking dirt dust grease and grime can mix with or stick to your caulk and make it look unappealing more importantly however they can interfere with the ability of the caulk to bind to the surfaces you do want it to stick to since one of the uses of baseboard caulking is to prevent water damage a tight seal is a must use water or a household cleaner like formula 409 to give your floor baseboard and wall a thorough cleaning try not to use soap with water as this combination can leave a slick film on your surfaces making it difficult for your caulk to stick for floors that have accumulated lots of dust vacuuming is one additional quick efficient cleaning option if you have the option try using your vacuum s long skinny hard to reach places attachment to remove dust from corners while caulking is by no means a dangerous process it is one that can be frustrating if you are forced to re do work you ve already done to minimize the risk of avoidable mistakes ensure that your work area is completely clear of furniture rugs and other potential obstructions before beginning if you have children or pets you ll also want to make sure they re kept out of your work area by setting up barriers or getting another person to monitor them nothing s worse than stopping your project to clean caulk out of a screaming toddler s hair when you caulk your baseboards mistakes are inevitable if it s your very first time they ll be common luckily when it comes to caulking it s hard to make serious mistakes for the vast majority of the errors you ll make the old fashioned combination of water and rags will suffice though many household cleaners will also work well additionally since you ll be on your hands and knees for most of the caulking process rags can be used as knee pads to provide comfort note that as will be explained below water alone is ineffective for cleaning up silicone based caulks perhaps the single most important thing you can do to ensure an easy efficient caulking process is to lay down tape with great care taping beforehand allows you to protect against spills and ensures that your caulking job is smooth clean and uniform no special tapes are required simply use ordinary masking tape also called painter s tape a thin papery variety of tape which is usually tan or blue you ll want to lay two strips of tape along each area to be caulked one should be on the floor following along the length of the baseboard and almost touching it the other should be on the wall roughly 1 16th of an inch above it running parallel to it a single long length of tape is usually the easiest option in the long run but using multiple manageable lengths is perfectly fine so long as they are all parallel to the the baseboard and aligned with each other caulking guns use specially designed cartridges to dispense caulk these look like long cylindrical tubes with a skinny pointed cone or nose at one end before loading your cartridge take a knife or a sharp pair of scissors and trim off the very end of this nose at about a 45 degree angle to create a small slanted hole this hole should be only about 1 8th of an inch in diameter about the width of a matchstick try to cut your cartridge s tip as conservatively as possible it s easy to make a small hole bigger but impossible to make a large hole smaller next use the gun s piercing rod which is usually a stiff piece of wire attached to the gun to poke a few holes in the cartridge s membrane through the hole you just cut in the tip this allows caulk to flow easily out of the cartridge the more holes you poke the more easily the caulk will flow about 4 5 holes is usually sufficient note that some plastic cartridges don t have an internal membrane if you don t feel any resistance when using the piercing rod you ll know this is the case most caulking guns can be loaded via the following steps push the spring loaded lever on the gun and hold it down pull the rod at rear of the gun the pushrod all the way back while holding the lever down insert the cartridge into its slot butt first then drop the cartridge s point down into the space in the front of the gun make sure the angle of the cut in the point is facing downwards you may need to turn the cartridge to do this finally twist the pushrod so the notches are facing downward pull the trigger a few times until you feel resistance you re now ready to caulk to practice spread out a large piece of newspaper on the floor and hold the point of your caulking gun against it pull lightly on the trigger until caulk begins to flow out of the nozzle when caulk begins to flow out of the gun move it slowly back while keeping constant pressure on the trigger try to make a long thin consistent line of caulk without any gaps or thick spots when you re done lift the nozzle from the work surface then twist the pushrod so the notches are in the up position and depress the spring loaded lever this releases the pressure on the cartridge and stops the flow of caulk don t squeeze too hard when you re applying caulk this can rupture the cartridge causing a mess and forcing you to start over when you re ready to caulk for real hold the tip of your caulking gun against the space where the wall and the top of the baseboard meet keep the hole in the tip flat against the wall this means you should hold the gun diagonally turn the notches in the pushrod downward squeeze on the trigger with steady pressure and begin moving the caulk gun along the length of the baseboard as the caulk flows out move at a slow even pace continue along the entire length of the baseboard treat any spills with a damp rag don t forget to repeat the process outlined in the practice step for stopping the flow of caulk when you re done with your run when you ve caulked one edge of your baseboard you ll want to smooth the caulk with your finger to ensure the caulk sits in its gap as securely as possible and also to ensure that the caulk has a uniform smooth appearance drag the tip of one finger along the caulk lightly a few feet at a time as soon as a significant amount of caulk accumulates on your finger wipe it off with a clean damp rag treat any spills with a separate damp rag don t smooth with too much force apply only gentle pressure with your finger pressing too hard can scrape the caulk from the wall entirely next repeat the caulking process for the bottom length of the baseboard keep firm but steady pressure on the trigger of the caulking gun to dispense caulk along the bottom edge of the baseboard caulking the bottoms of the baseboards after you ve finished smoothing the caulk on the top of the baseboard ensures that leftover caulk from the top won t spill onto your work below when finished smooth over the caulk with your finger as described above when you ve caulked and smoothed both edges of a length of baseboard to your satisfaction it s time to pull your tape up be sure to do this while the caulk is still fresh if the caulk dries before you pull up the tape you ll end up pulling the caulk from the baseboard along with the tape and will have to repeat your work grab one end of your length of tape and pull it gently away from the surface at a forty five degree angle proceed slowly and delicately along the entire length of tape repeat for the second length of tape if you used multiple lengths of tape for a single surface pull the tape from the wall in the same direction that you laid it for instance if you laid three overlapping pieces of tape from left to right pull the tape from left to right as well handle the tape with care the leftover caulk can stick to and stain clothing with ease for the most part caulking isn t a terribly dangerous activity you re unlikely to endanger yourself or others while caulking this being said there are things you can do to improve your already very good chances of finishing your caulking job unscathed the first is to ensure that your work area is properly ventilated setting up a fan and or opening windows improves the flow of air through your work area which can disperse the odor and fumes that wet caulk can give off this is especially important for silicone based caulk which has the strongest odor if you re working outside you don t usually need to worry about this caulk isn t dangerous or caustic like certain substances used for other home improvement projects its very purpose is essentially to be as inert as possible however it is very sticky and hard to remove from skin and clothing especially once it dries so you may want to wear gloves when you work with caulk to keep it off of your fingers and sleeves this also gives the benefit of making clean up very quick and easy you may also want to wear goggles or protective eyewear as caulk can be painful if splashed into the eyes though this is unlikely the one time that you re most likely to hurt yourself while caulking is ironically before you re using caulk as you cut the tip off of your caulk cartridge take caution to ensure you don t cut yourself if you re using a knife be sure to hold the cartridge with your other hand away from the tip always cut away from your body never towards it when you re not using your knife or scissors store it safely away from your work area finally it bears mentioning that although caulk is fairly harmless it is not meant to be consumed or inhaled and can cause serious health problems if it is if you or someone you know accidentally consumes caulk call a poison control center immediately for guidance be sure to wash your hands after caulking to ensure you don t accidentally consume caulk while eating drinking coughing and so on when you ve caulked your baseboard and pulled your tape all that s left to do is to allow it dry different types of caulk will have different drying times so check your caulk s packaging for more information regardless of the amount of time it takes your caulk to dry you ll want to ensure that no dirt or dust disturb it as it sets you ll also want to ensure that young children and pets are kept away from the caulk as well when it comes to caulking minor errors are all too common usually fixing these errors by hand before the caulk sets by using your fingers is simpler and easier than fixing the errors after the caulk dries to do this just repeat the smoothing process with your finger using extra caulk as needed if you notice an error after your caulk has dried re apply tape to the offending area apply caulk to your finger and work it into the crack or gap until it s well blended with the surrounding dry caulk when your caulk dries the repair should be barely visible if you used a caulking gun for your main job but have a small caulk tube handy you may find that it s much easier to use the tube for touch up work than to have to assemble a caulk gun again dispense caulk and potentially clean up spills just be sure to use the same type of caulk as you used for the main job as always remember to remove the tape while the caulk is still fresh congratulations you re done all that s left to do is to return your work area to the way it was before you began release the pressure on your caulking gun and remove the cartridge most cartridges come with a cap to preserve the leftover caulk if yours does not try using plastic wrap and a rubber band or tape wash your hands and your equipment with soap water and a washcloth remove any garbage or debris and replace any furniture rugs etc you moved when using leftover caulk at a later date note that you may need to use a nail or tack to remove dried caulk from the nozzle of the cartridge in general caulking is a fairly cheap and easy home improvement project however it has its limitations caulk is useful for sealing small thin gaps between baseboards and the floor or wall it s not however appropriate for protecting the baseboard itself which must be painted to provide protection from water damage and wear and tear additionally while baseboard caulking is great for making the bottom edges of a room water tight it provides little protection against large sources of water damage like burst pipes leaky ceilings or walls and so on thus baseboard caulking is best used as just one part of a more extensive plan for water proofing a room which should also include painting finishing tiling and more it s also worth noting that baseboards should not be caulked when the floor or wall is unfinished wood in this situation caulk provides little protection from water and cannot form a tight seal against the surface it is applied to the time that it will take to caulk varies based on the size of your project as well as how long it takes you to become familiar with your tools most one room jobs can be completed within an hour or two while longer jobs can take days regardless of the size of your job you won t want to rush so leave yourself more time than you think you ll need a thorough caulking job can take lots of time in the short term but mistakes in your caulking that can result from rushing can cost you more time in the long run generally caulking is quite cheap caulking guns retail from about 5 10 for cheap options up to about 20 for the highest quality options cartridges of caulk usually cost no more than 5 in addition to these things you may need to buy masking tape a knife or scissors and gloves all in all you usually won t need to spend more than 30 40 if you own some of these materials already your costs will be lower your costs will vary based on how many cartridges of caulk you need to buy as a point of reference for a 10 x 10 foot bathroom you ll need about 1 or 2 cartridges it s usually smart to buy a little more caulk than you think you ll need you can always save this left over caulk for later

runner choose the correct blade length choose comfortable skates hockey skates won t work for figure skating and figure skates won t work for playing hockey figure skates have a longer blade and a toe pick on the front while hockey skates have a curved blade and no pick figure skates are more stable than hockey skates and are better for recreational skaters if you are purchasing a first pair of recreational skates for your child you re probably better off starting with figure skates most of the guidelines for purchasing children s ice skates apply to children of all ages but keep in mind that toddlers need skates with a wide double rail two blades and a solid bottom these skates will be safer and more comfortable for very young skaters and they won t need to be broken in children younger than six should also have a double rail to prevent wobbly ankles there are a huge variety of children s ice skates on the market and different types of skating call for different skates in general then it s best to buy your child s skates from a dedicated skating store where you can get the advice and assistance of a professional avoid purchasing skates from a general department store without professional guidance you may wind up with the wrong type of skates for your child and this could lead to poor performance an uncomfortable fit or even an injury if your child has a coach or teacher you can also use this person as a resource he or she will have specific recommendations for your child and may also know where you can get the best deal on the skates you need correct fit is crucial if the skates are too small they will hurt your child s feet but if they are too large they won t provide the necessary stability your child will likely need a different size in skates than he or she wears in sneakers so again a professional fitting is important take your child to try the skates on wearing thin socks or whatever socks he or she will usually wear when skating try on several different brands as each will have a slightly different fit the skates should feel quite snug compared to regular shoes but they should not be painful lace up the skates completely when trying on to get the best sense of the way a particular pair of skates will fit you need to lace them all the way up have your child stand and walk in the skates if his or her heel lifts out of the boot or if there is much wiggle room in the toes the skates are too large you may be tempted to buy a larger size so that your growing child can wear them for a bit longer but this isn t a good idea in fact it could even lead to injury if you absolutely cannot try on skates in person and must estimate start with a pair of skates two sizes smaller than your child s typical sneaker size if you ve found the right kind of skates in the correct size you re already well on your way to choosing something your child will feel comfortable in however there are a few other things to keep in mind when you compare options avoid buying double bladed skates or the kind that you strap onto your shoes these skates don t grip the ice properly your child may feel wobbly and uncomfortable in these skates and he or she may wind up with a completely avoidable injury children s skates should provide good ankle stability to prevent injury this means that the skates need to have moderate stiffness and your child should not be wobbly while standing in them although they are more expensive higher quality skates will provide comfort and stability leading to happy and injury free skating sessions in general good figure skates will be made out of leather while good hockey style skates will be made out of strong but lightweight materials different brands work best for different skates but in general jackson and riedell are seen as the best figure skate manufacturers bauer is a popular brand for hockey skates kids can outgrow skates very quickly since you can t buy skates a size too large without risking injury you ll want to look for something affordable it s probably not wise to buy the cheapest skates on the market as these might not provide the support comfort or performance that you want but there are a few ways to save money on your child s skates consider a skate package while boots the shoe part and blades can be bought separately it is often easier and cheaper to purchase them as a package this is especially true for kids who may only be using their skates for one season before outgrowing them look for skates allow for size adjustments some skates are built to be adjustable so that children can use them for a longer period of time consider used skates if you are struggling to afford a quality pair of skates for your child you can try getting used ones from friends relatives or your children s teammates however fit and function are still crucial if you can t find the right kind of skates in a good fit it s not worth the savings skates that have the boots and blades attached allow for easy maintenance additionally you will want blades that maintain their sharpness to reduce the maintenance required quality blades will reduce the need for constant sharpening make sure you use blade guards and completely dry your skates every time you use them to maintain them brand new ice skates might feel slightly uncomfortable even if they fit perfectly your child may wind up with a blister or two make sure your child understands that these issues should be temporary once the skates have been worn a few times they should feel nice and comfortable you can minimize this period of discomfort by having your child wear brand new skates for only thirty minutes at a time recreational skates are very different than those for figure skating or professional skaters they are made to allow you to move forwards and backwards do crossovers and complete simple turns but they won t work for competitive figure skating or professional level hockey in most cases it s best to buy from someone trained to recommend the best skates for your needs do not purchase skates from a general department store because these skates will not give enough ankle support and can increase your odds of winding up with an injury for most recreational skaters skates that have the blade and boot the shoe part already connected work best these skate packages are often cheaper lower maintenance and simpler to purchase most recreational skates come with the blades already attached to the boots check with a professional at the skate shop to see what your options are the best recreational figure skates should be made of leather with steel blades attached only to the sole of the skate recreational hockey skates should be made at least partly from cloth and have a fiberglass frame cheaper recreational skates will often be made out of plastic or synthetic leather if you don t skate often and don t feel you need the highest quality skates this may be an acceptable compromise for you skates made out of vinyl will be very cold they do not provide much stability either so it s best to avoid them the best hockey skates will have a gel layer inside that conforms to your feet when they warm up recreational skates start around 50 and can go up in price from there some are as much as 1000 most recreational skaters should budget somewhere between 50 200 depending on the desired quality skates at the low end of the range will be of lower quality and comfort than those at the upper range if you buy boots and blades separately for figure skating you ll spend more perhaps up to 600 for the boots and 600 for the blades fleece lined skates have limited usefulness unless you are skating outdoors in very cold weather otherwise they do not provide much control over your feet and can be difficult to use start by trying on skates that are one size smaller than your normal shoe size skates are meant to be tighter on your feet than normal shoes it may be difficult to find special sizes in recreational skates but they can come in many sizes and different widths check with your skating store to see whether they carry skates in very small or very large sizes and see which brands come in narrow or wide versions many recreational skates are quite soft for extra comfort but not good for intermediate figure skaters that will be doing turns and spins skates with a moderate stiffness will be best for providing good support while also being flexible enough for quick breaking in and good comfort if you are a beginner or just want to enjoy being on the ice with family and friends then you should choose a soft skate for comfort if you are an intermediate skater and beginning to learn freestyle skills but are not ready to be high end figure skating skates then you should go with a more moderately stiff skate check the tongue of the boot for stiffness and padding the tongue has a big effect on comfort and extra padding will protect your legs and feet from injury wear thin socks that are the same as those you will be skating in and lace your skates properly skates should be laced loosely around the toe area tightly over the bridge of your foot and beginning of your ankle and a bit looser around the top of the skate thin socks give better control over the skate and should not make your feet cold if you choose good quality skates do not wrap long laces around your ankle rather loop them around the hooks at the top of the skate walk around for at least five minutes to test the skate and see how it feels your heel should not be moving around at all if it does move try to tighten the skate and if it still moves then you should go down to the next size walking wobbly or standing knock kneed or pigeon toed is a sign that you may need a smaller size skate if your skates are painful to walk in or if your feet fall asleep within five minutes of walking then you should try a half size bigger you should feel as solid walking in skates as you do in your normal shoes when you bend your knees your skates should give slightly without your ankles rolling skates can come in different widths and they can be stretched to some degree if your skate seems a little tight across the ball of your foot then you might be able to fix the problem with a spray or stretcher ice skate blades should have two edges with a slight hollow in between and should be smooth and without dents they should also easily scratch the surface of your fingernail when you run it across if you see any of these problems then you should have your skates sharpened some stores will be able to sharpen the skates for you alternatively most indoor rinks or skating supply stores will have a specialist who can sharpen your blades for you even if you choose skates that are sized perfectly they may cause some discomfort or blistering the first few times you wear them figure skates provide specialized support and control for advanced skaters this allows skaters to execute jumps spins and difficult turns these skates will be very different from those for recreational skaters figure skaters need professional advice in selecting skates so don t shop from regular department stores having the right pair of skates is much too important to risk buying from anyone who isn t trained to help competitive skaters high quality figure skating boots can cost 600 with the blades costing around the same speak to your local store or coach to determine the amount you will need to budget for your skates if your budget is tight it may be better to purchase higher quality used skates as opposed to lower quality new skates make sure the used skates fit correctly have sufficient support and have blades that still have some sharpening life left when in doubt consult with your coach or another professional before buying figure skates can be quite expensive so it is important to choose the correct ones for your size and ability don t assume that the first pair you try will work you may need to try several different sizes in several different brands before you find something that works there should be no extra room in the boot figure skates are meant to fit quite tightly to increase stability while skating in fact many figure skates can be heat molded to fit your feet exactly take advantage of this opportunity baking will mold the skates to your feet as perfectly as possible measure both your feet when deciding on your shoe size in case one foot is bigger than the other sizing differs between brands so be aware that if you choose a new brand you may also need to choose a new size choose the correct width many figure skates come in narrow or wide sizes so don t settle for a mediocre fit while pre assembled packages are fine for beginners and recreational skaters it is better for intermediate and advanced skaters to choose their boots and blades separately this allows you to customize your features according to your body and style again consulting a professional is crucial your coach or another professional can help make sure you get the right combination of boots and blades competitive boots are typically made of leather and come in different levels of support boots for those completing single jumps will be lightweight while those for doubles and triples will be stiffer to provide a better level of support and stability stronger heavier skaters should choose boots that offer additional support higher quality blades will be sharpened less often and have better flow on the ice blade quality will affect spin and jump quality so it is an important aspect of your skates blades are usually chosen based on the size and features of the toe pick larger toe picks give more stability for jumps smaller toe picks and shorter blades are better for dance and synchronized skating parabolic blades are good for those having trouble with edge slips k picks are for those who skid or slip or toe jumps advanced figure skaters may need to make minor adjustments to their skates for the perfect fit if you find the right pair of skates and they fit well in general but rub your feet uncomfortably in just one or two places you can have them punched pushed out a bit in particular spots properly secured laces are essential for providing stability and comfort while skating make sure your foot is placed in the boot all the way and tighten up the laces in the first half of the boot the laces in this section should be secure but not overly tight lace the second half of the boot and pull hard over the top of the foot and where the ankle bends this area is the most the important part of lacing figure skates finish lacing the boots around the hooks without pulling the laces too hard the laces should be secure but not overly tight ice hockey is a competitive sport that involves a lot of time in your skates different positions will require different kinds of skates so it important to know what style of play you will be engaging in purchase skates from a dedicated skating store so that you can get the advice and assistance of someone who knows about hockey skates do not purchase skates from a general department store these skates will not provide enough ankle support and may make you more prone to injuries there s more than one kind of hockey skate on the market and they are truly distinct so it s important to buy the correct kind goalie skates have a lower boot with a wider blade for more stability and ankle and foot protection other kinds of hockey skates also differ according to certain features including blade radius your individual needs will depend on what position you play hockey skates start at about 50 and go up from there depending on the quality of the materials used to make the skates if you play competitively you may want to invest in a more expensive pair of skates most hockey skates are a mixture of leather and synthetic materials to optimize durability performance and comfort different synthetic materials such as kevlar or graphite will determine the quality of the skate and the cost talk to your coach or another professional about the best material for your needs you want hockey skates with the highest durability comfort ankle support stiffness padding and workmanship in the most lightweight skate possible many hockey skates offer gel inside that can warm up and mold to your feet providing the best comfort and fit on hockey skates the holder is the plastic piece between the boot and runner and the runner is the blade most beginning level hockey skates will have a one piece holder and runner it is better to choose a one piece holder and runner for a beginner hockey player because they are cheaper if the blade or holder happens to break at some point it usually costs around the same to replace the entire skate competitive hockey players will want to choose the two piece design because if the runner breaks it can be easily replaced the runner and or holder may break when a high speed shot is taken directly at the runner holder hockey blades have a concave or hollowed out shape and are measured based on the amount of blade that is in contact with the ice called the blade radius to measure radius place the two blades together bottom to bottom and measure the distance between the points where the blades touch beginners will want a blade radius of around 5 inches 12 5 cm to give stability while moving forward and backwards to improve cutting and turning choose a blade radius of 3 4 inches 7 5 10 cm if you are a forward you will want a shorter blade radius to improve maneuverability defensemen will want a longer blade for added stability goalies will chose an even longer blade radius and have a less hollow grind to increase the contact with the ice choose hockey skate size differently from figure skates because they need to be tighter for more stability and less chafing try your hockey skates on with a thicker hockey sock so that you know how they will fit when you are actually playing different manufacturers make their hockey skates differently so it is important to try on a range of brands choose the correct width width is one of the most important factors in choosing the hockey skates that fit best most brands come in a range of widths including standard width d or r wide boots e ee or w and sometimes even narrow width c if you have never had issues with sneaker sizes then you will probably be fine with standard width skates hockey is a fast paced game and hockey players must feel like their skates are part of their feet it is important to choose hockey skates that are comfortable and feel natural on your feet understand that it may take some time to break your skates in the first few times you wear a new pair of hockey skates you might have some discomfort or even develop a blister or two if you ve purchased good skates that fit correctly however this should be a temporary issue

query	147	know if you have esophagitis esophagitis is the medical term used to describe an inflammation of the esophagus in most medical terminology the ending itis means an inflammation and the first part of the word indicates the part of the body that is swollen or inflamed the esophagus is the muscular tube that connects your mouth with your stomach transporting food after you ve chewed it into the stomach for further digestion at the entrance to the stomach is a tight circular muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter this muscle is designed to close tightly to keep stomach acid inside the stomach when the sphincter at the top of the stomach is weakened it allows acid to reflux into the esophagus this causes irritation or inflammation in the esophagus the symptoms of esophagitis will help you determine if you have the condition through early recognition and treatment you can reduce the long term effects of damage to the cells in the esophagus observing symptoms of esophagitis learning if your habits are causing esophagitis learning if your health is causing esophagitis diagnosing and treating esophagitis making lifestyle changes determine if you have difficult or painful swallowing assess if you re getting heartburn frequently be aware of signs of eosinophilic esophagitis allergy induced esophagitis observe your reaction to alcohol and smoking keep track of your intake of certain foods pay attention to how you swallow pills determine if you have chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease talk to your doctor about your health conditions get evaluated for infections get tested for allergies make simple changes to see if the symptoms go away quickly know when to see your doctor watch for severe symptoms get diagnosed by your doctor talk to your doctor about a barium x ray ask about an endoscopy discuss proton pump inhibitors ppi with your doctor try an h2 blocker get periodic endoscopies if you have had esophagitis don t let esophagitis go untreated change your eating habits maintain a healthy weight stop smoking wear comfortable clothing take medication with plenty of water sleep with your head elevated when the esophagus is inflamed or irritated food moving through the esophagus to the stomach will increase this pain sometimes the esophagus is inflamed enough that swallowing becomes difficult since the food has limited space to pass when the acid reflux from the stomach goes up the esophagus to the vocal cords it can cause hoarseness and a sore throat although these are common signs of gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd as well when associated with esophagitis they are usually accompanied with difficult or painful swallowing heartburn is a common symptom of esophagitis when it is related to reflux when acid leaves the stomach and enters the esophagus it will cause a burning sensation because the cells of the esophagus were not designed to withstand an acidic environment if you have eosinophilic esophagitis there is a buildup of white cells called eosinophils in the esophagus and stomach the white cells produce a protein which causes inflammation in your throat and can lead to scarring narrowing and formation of excessive fibrous tissue in the lining of your esophagus an allergic response might also induce stomach pain and nausea and or vomiting this can occur at almost any age and happens more commonly in caucasian men as a result to the inflammation you may have difficulty swallowing food the esophagus can narrow to the point that food cannot pass through and becomes impacted this is a medical emergency and requires the immediate care of a surgeon you can affect your risk for esophagitis through some of the lifestyle choices you make alcohol reduces the strength of the lower esophageal sphincter and can trigger gastroesophageal reflux or stomach acid that refluxes up the esophagus this creates irritation and inflammation in the lining of the esophagus take note how you feel after you drink alcohol see if you start to notice a trend cigarette smoking has the same effect on the esophagus acidic foods and caffeinated beverages will also increase the acidity in the stomach these can increase the risk of reflux and trigger esophagitis write down the foods you eat and how you feel in the hours after you eat drug induced esophagitis is triggered when you swallow pills with little to no water the residue from the pill remains in the esophagus creating irritation and inflammation some of the more common medications to create this problem includes pain relievers such as ibuprofen aspirin and naproxen sodium antibiotics potassium chloride biphosphonates for treatment of osteoporosis and quinidine used for treatment of some heart conditions reflux esophagitis occurs when the stomach acid refluxes through the lower esophageal sphincter and into the esophagus gerd is a condition in which this backflow is a chronic problem one complication of gerd is tissue damage to the esophagus leading to esophagitis your risk for esophagitis can increase because of pre existing medical conditions for example surgery or radiation to the chest will weaken the lower esophageal sphincter and increase your risk of experiencing esophagitis chronic vomiting weakens the sphincter from pressure in the stomach and thus increases the risk of esophagitis people with a weakened immune system from medications or an immune mediated illness such as hiv can develop infections that lead to esophagitis these infections include those due to fungi or viruses such as herpes or cytomegalovirus infectious esophagitis can be the result of a bacterial viral or fungal infection although relatively rare this type of esophagitis will occur more often in people with poor immune function such as people suffering from hiv leukemia chemotherapy treatments for cancer diabetes or organ transplant symptoms associated with infectious esophagitis can include fever and chills associated with the infection oral thrush if the infectious agent is candida albicansif the infection is herpes or cytomegalovirus you may experience sores in your mouth or in the back of your throat making swallowing food or saliva even more uncomfortable you may be having an allergic reaction that can cause esophagitis eosinophilic esophagitis can occur in response to an allergic reaction or from acid reflux or both eosinophils are white blood cells that play a role in allergic reactions in the body sometimes the allergy is to foods such as milk eggs wheat soy or peanuts at other times people can have non food reactions to pollen or dander which causes esophagitis in many cases esophagitis will clear spontaneously within three to five days this is especially true when the trigger was taking medication without enough water and you start drinking lots of water with medication if you resolve your gerd then the esophagitis will also begin to heal spontaneously stop eating the foods that cause an allergic reaction eosinophilic esophagitis and the inflammation and irritation will resolve some people experience symptoms that necessitate a visit to the doctor in order to prevent further physical damage make an appointment with your doctor if you notice symptoms that last more than a few days symptoms that don t improve or go away with over the counter antacids changes to the way you take medications or when you stop eating the foods causing the allergic reaction symptoms that are severe enough that you have difficulty eating any symptoms of esophagitis accompanied by signs of infection such as muscle aches headache and fever any symptoms of esophagitis that is accompanied by shortness of breath or chest pain that happens shortly after eating emergency care is needed if your symptoms also include you suspect that you have food lodged in the esophagus you have a history of heart disease or experience chest pain you experience chest pain that lasts more than a couple minutes you vomit blood which can indicate bleeding from the esophagus you have black tarry stools which indicate bleeding in the digestive tract blood turns black with a tar appearance after exposure to digestive enzymes if the esophagus is bleeding it can either turn the stool black in color or you may vomit blood your doctor will make a diagnosis based on a thorough history and physical examination as well as one or more tests keep in mind that your doctor will recommend treatment based on the cause of esophagitis a barium x ray usually called a barium swallow is an imaging study which uses a barium solution that lines the esophagus and stomach making the organs more visible these images will identify any narrowing of the esophagus they can also indicate any other structural changes such as hernias tumors or other abnormalities an endoscopy is a test which uses a tiny camera placed down the throat into the esophagus your doctor will look for any unusual appearance of the esophagus this procedure also gives your doctor the opportunity to remove small tissue samples for testing the appearance of the esophagus can change if the esophagitis is caused from drugs reflux or eosinophilic esophagitis tissue samples removed during an endoscopy can be tested for bacterial viral or fungal infections determine if there are white blood cells eosinophils in the tissue and identify abnormal cells that could indicate cancer or precancerous changes these medications block and control acid production are often the first line of defense they may not work for all patients but some people respond well and will experience relief from inflammation if you don t respond to ppis your doctor may prescribe a steroid such as fluticasone or budesonide these are prescription or over the counter medications which reduce the production of stomach acid these medications include famotidine pepcid nizatidine axid ranitidine zantac talk to your doctor about which h2 blocker is right for you common side effects include constipation diarrhea dizziness headache hives nausea or vomiting or problems with urination if your doctor diagnoses you with esophagitis and he determines that it is triggered by reflux your doctor may prescribe periodic surveillance endoscopy this means that periodically depending upon the severity of your symptoms and any other problems you might be having your doctor will perform an endoscopy he will look for tissue changes and evaluate tissue samples for precancerous conditions left untreated esophagitis can result in narrowing of the esophagus from scar tissue this is called a stricture of the esophagus this causes swallowing to be difficult until the stricture is treated and the esophagus returns to a normal size barrett s esophagus is a second long term side effect of chronic inflammation and irritation to the esophagus as the esophagus tries to heal the cells in the esophagus change to those similar to cells found in the intestines this type of cell change is associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer the tissue changes that are characteristic of barrett s esophagus cause no symptoms for the individual the risk is small but it s important to have regular checkups if precancerous cells are discovered they can be treated immediately chronic and uncontrolled inflammation can also trigger irreversible structural alterations this leads to tissue fibrosis stricture formation and ultimately impaired function of the esophagus this remodeling of the esophagus can require surgical intervention other long term consequences of untreated esophagitis resulting from reflux include damage to the lungs and upper esophageal area such as asthma laryngitis and chronic coughing these changes are the result of the exposure of the cells in the lungs and larynx to stomach acid which also triggers the inflammatory response in the esophagus if you are afflicted by esophagitis you should consider how your diet is contributing to the condition making some changes to your diet may help you overcome your esophagitis try the following strategies eat several small meals during the day eliminate chocolate mints and alcohol don t eat any foods that give you an allergic response avoid foods high in acid and other foods that trigger your heartburn avoid stooping over or bending immediately after meals this increases the pressure in the stomach and triggers reflux wait for at least three hours after eating to lie down or go to bed too much excess body weight can contribute to pressure on your abdomen talk to your doctor to determine a healthy weight for your body frame maintaining this weight will reduce pressure on the stomach and the lower esophageal sphincter smoking can contribute to your chances of developing esophagitis give up smoking by making a plan to quit and using products to help you quit such as nicotine gum or a nicotine patch when your clothes are too tight you may be putting added pressure on your stomach and lower esophageal sphincter go for clothes that fit properly or slightly loosely find pants that fit your waist comfortably instead of pants with a tight waistband taking medications without drinking plenty of water with them can cause irritation to the lining of the esophagus and trigger esophagitis some of these medication include tetracycline doxycycline alendronate ibandronate and vitamin c take all medication with plenty of water to reduce the irritation to the esophagus when you elevate the head of your bed your head will be higher than your chest causing acid to stay in your stomach place wooden blocks under the head of the bed to elevate it do not use pillows to elevate your head this causes you to bend in the middle both increasing the pressure on the abdomen and increasing the potential for back and neck problems 
query	148	play the snare drum the snare drum is one of the most widely utilized percussion instruments in western music snare drums are featured in both orchestral and marching percussion scores and this drum is also the cornerstone of the modern drum set learning how to play the snare drum is often the first step a budding percussionist will take to learn the snare drum practice basic techniques and rolls and then focus on keeping time learning basic technique practicing drumming rudiments keeping time moving forward set up your snare drum practice different matched grips try a traditional grip for soft sound and jazz use correct posture practice striking the drums try basic strokes try a single stroke roll practice a double stroke roll try a buzz roll use correct technique when practicing practice finger technique listen to the cues of your band practice with a metronome put timing first rest your thumbs practice each day record yourself consider lessons if you want to play an instrument you need to understand how to set it up safely this way you can follow guidelines and practice efficiently the snare drum is a small circular drum that can be placed on a metallic stand your stand will usually have a base comprised of three to four moveable legs spread the legs wide enough to create a stable base for the drum the stand should not be wiggling at all as you begin to fit the snare drum into it on the top of your case there is a metallic chamber where you secure your snare drum this called the basket gently fit your drum into the basket making sure the drum stays relatively still in response to pressure and movement the snare drum should be at about waist level if your snare drum is too high or too low adjust the stand s height accordingly your snare drum should tilt towards you slightly if you feel uncomfortable or awkward as you begin playing you can tweak how the drum is tilted for your personal comfort wing nuts are screws found on your snare drum stand which have large wing like bolts make sure you go through and tighten all the wing nuts slightly each time you begin playing your snare drum depending on the type of drumming you re doing you grip your sticks differently before you begin to play the snare drum spend some time familiarizing yourself with different grips in a matched grip common with beginners you hold both drumsticks in the same way this is a standard type of grip for most drumming techniques there are three ways to use a matched grip in a germanium grip common in rock drumming find the balance point or fulcrum point of your drumsticks grip your drum with your thumb and index finger here placing your remaining fingers at the bottom of the drum stick keep your elbows out and bend the drum sticks at a 90 degree angle pointing towards the snare drum your palms should be pointing down the american grip is the same as the germanium grip in terms of how you hold the drumsticks however the angle is slightly different let your arms fall down and point the drumsticks at a 45 degree angle pointing to the snare drum once again keeping your palms down many people find the american grip comfortable so it s popular for drumming beginners the third kind of matched grip is the french grip you hold the drumsticks close together and almost parallel you also keep your palms up when holding your sticks this might not be the best hold for beginners while it allows for quicker movements it can be hard to maintain control over drum strokes a traditional grip is most common in jazz drumming hold the stick with your palm up placing the balance point of your stick in the pocket created between your thumb and index finger keep your index and middle finger on top of the stick and your pinky and ring finger on the bottom of your stick as you don t get as much power out of strokes with this grip use it for softer styles and jazz your posture is important when it comes to drumming you will not play as effectively without good posture and you can also cause yourself back pain learn correct posture before you begin playing the snare drum keep your legs slightly apart when you stand and hold your back straight keep your arms at your sides allow them to rest in a position that s comfortable to you once again the drum should be at waist level adjust the stand if it s too high or too low keep your body relaxed especially your shoulders hands and arms to begin just experiment with drum strokes before learning specific moves or techniques make sure you know how to use your drumsticks correctly the end of a drumstick is referred to as the bead the bead of a drumstick should move up and down in a straight line as you play try your best to hit the same part of the drum with each beat this can take some practice as it s hard to have full control over the movement of your drumsticks when you re first starting out the sticks should bounce off of the drums to achieve a bouncing effect keep your fingers hands and arms relaxed practice just beating on the drum freely until you feel like you have some control over the drumsticks then you can start learning some moves there are five basic drum strokes for a snare drum as you learn how to play your snare drum try simply practicing the basic strokes this will help you become more proficient as you learn more about the snare drum the full stroke means you hold the drums using your preferred grip in a slightly upright position that is your drumsticks will be pointing upward towards the ceiling when you re using a full stroke your drumsticks will begin in the upright position at the start of a beat and return to the upright position at the end of a beat a down stroke is a slight variation of a full stroke your drum sticks start in the upright position however at the end of a beat they should be pointed downward slightly towards your snare drum in a tap stroke at the beginning of the beat your drumsticks are in the downward position at the end of the beat they return to the downward position in an up stroke your drumsticks are in the downward position at the beginning of a beat by the end of the beat they re in the upright position when reading music drum parts will usually indicate which strokes you are using f stands for full stroke d stands for down stroke t stands for tap stroke and u stands for upstroke the single strike roll is an important drum rudiment if you want to learn how to play the snare drum you ll need to know a basic single strike roll practicing a single stroke roll can be a great introduction to basic drumming it will help you get a feel of your drumsticks and teach you how to control them a drum roll is a simple move in which you quickly alternate between playing with your left and right hand you start with your dominant hand for example if you re right handed you would play right then left then right then left and so on if you re left handed play left then right then left then right and so on start off slow just aim to have good control of your drumsticks make sure they rise and fall in a straight line and land on the same point on the drum each time do not pay attention to timing as you begin practicing just focus on going from left to right or from right to left while maintaining control of your drumsticks once you feel in control begin to incorporate timing make sure the beats are even that is make sure you spend equal time on each beat try to challenge yourself increase you speed with each practice session trying to remain in control of your drumsticks while keeping an even tempo as speed increases a double stroke roll is a slight variation on the single stroke roll like the single stroke roll it can be used to get a feel for your drumsticks it s another basic snare drum rudiment to master as you re starting off in the double stroke roll you use two strikes per hand instead of one this creates a faster paced more intense tempo once again lead with your dominant hand if you re right handed play right right left left right right left left and so on if you re left handed play left left right right left left right right and so on your drum sticks should bounce naturally when you keep your wrist relaxed hit the drum and allow the stick to bounce twice then stop movement in your wrist and fingers and pull the drum stick upward repeat on the other side start off slow when mastering any new technique on the snare drum you ll need time to gain control make sure you re moving your drum sticks in a straight line make sure the beads of the sticks hit the same spot on the drum for each beat practice as long as it takes to feel in control as you feel more comfortable controlling the drum sticks move up to a faster pace eventually you should be able to do a quick paced double and single roll a buzz roll is a slightly more advanced drum roll similar to the double stroke roll a buzz roll uses a more relaxed grip to allow more fluid movements learn the buzz roll one hand at a time start with whichever hand you prefer use your index finger and thumb primarily to guide the drum stick this hold can take a bit of practice before it feels secure say you re starting with your left hand use your left hand to strike the snare drum allow the drumstick to bounce freely allowing it to continue bouncing until movement stop naturally do not as you did with the double roll use your wrist to stop the drumstick repeat this with your left hand keep going back and forth with your hands as you go increase the tempo slightly minimize time between striking your left drumstick and striking your right drumstick the buzz roll is meant to build intensity and excitement over time as you practice basic drum moves remember to follow the proper technique you ll need to keep technique in mind to practice efficiently keep your posture in mind remember to relax your body keep your legs apart and make sure the drum is at waist level use the proper grip the grip as outlined depends heavily on the type of music and your level of proficiency matched grips are best when you re starting off drumming as they allow for the most control however if you re going into jazz drumming specifically use the traditional grip it s very important to keep your hands relaxed gripping too hard on a drumstick does not provide more control it can also cause tension in your hands leading to fatigue and cramping even if you feel a loss of control try to remember not to hold too hard on your drumsticks solid finger technique is what allows you to maneuver your drumsticks efficiently as you move through the basics of drumming take a moment to familiarize yourself with basic finger techniques to gain greater control over your drumsticks practice moving the sticks with only your fingers keep your wrists and arms completely still as you move your drumsticks up and down do some of the basic moves we have outlined like a single roll double roll and buzz roll as you practice these moves only use your fingers to move your drumsticks keep your hands loose as you play do not stress out about playing fast you can increase tempo later on when you feel more in control of your drumsticks with finger technique you should actually train your weaker hand first this way you re more likely to spend adequate time training your less dominant hand if you re right handed start with your left hand if you re left handed start with your right hand if you re working with a band learn to work as a team timing is vital if you want to be a good drummer pay attention to the band s beat to determine the tempo you should use drummers provide the backbone of rhythm in a song the underlying beat of a song is usually defined by a drum you need to be able to speed up and slow down when necessary and play in the tempo required by the piece you re performing review the songs you re playing ahead of time to get a sense of when to speed up and when to slow down practice playing along to a recording before going to band practice keeping an eye on your time be open to criticism teamwork is important in a band or orchestra if your bandmates or conductor tell you that you re playing too fast or too slow accept this as constructive criticism try to ask them what you can do to play at a more even tempo if you feel you re playing too slow or too fast listen to the tempo of the other instruments and players try to match that tempo as you work your drum beats a metronome is a small handheld device that keeps beats all drummers need to start off practicing with a metronome if they want to learn to keep time you can set a metronome to whatever tempo you want and try to hit your drum with the beats it keeps as you practice with a metronome pay attention to when you start slipping for some drummers keeping beat is difficult towards the beginning of a song it may take them a few minutes to get into the swing however for other drummers the end of the song is where they tire down and begin to slip if you know your weak spots you ll be able to know when to be extra vigilant during performances ask your band or conductor if you can keep a metronome going into practice for some drummers having the clicking tempo in their head keeps them focused you may find using a metronome while playing with others is tremendously helpful if your beats are not in time they will sound off to the audience even if other aspects of your technique are solid bad timing interferes with other musicians and creates confusion for the audience as you begin moving past the basics of the snare drum and playing with others prioritize learning to keep time practice with a metronome each night and ask your bandmates and conductors for constructive feedback your thumbs tend to cramp and become sore if you play the drums a lot try to rest your thumbs between performances and practice do not engage in activities like texting and typing that require you to use your thumbs try gently massaging the skin around your thumbs or soaking them in warm water there s no magic trick to getting better at a musical instrument you simply need to practice each day the only way to become proficient in playing the snare drum is to put in the necessary work practice should be part of your daily routine just as you brush your teeth and shower in the morning practicing your snare drum should be a daily priority take half an hour to a hour each day to practice schedule practice time into your weekly routine if you get done with school or work around 3 o clock each day see if you can schedule practice time around 4 o clock you can adjust this schedule on weekends or if there are extenuating circumstances make sure you re conscientious of others when practicing drums can be loud if you re playing on a second story make sure you put down carpeting or a rug under your drums to muffle the sound try not to practice too late at night or too early in the day keep a record of yourself practicing you can listen to yourself playing afterwards and check for your strengths and weaknesses you do not need extensive equipment to record yourself as your primary goal is to gauge your own proficiency you can use your laptop or phone to record practice sessions lessons can be a great way to increase your proficiency there are many different techniques and styles involved in playing the snare drum after learning some basics consider seeing a professional instructor he or she will be able to observe you playing and offer specific feedback based on your style if money is an issue consider buying a book on the snare drum while this is not the same as one on one instruction it could provide some additional insight on technique and style

moderate amounts of whole grains make going meatless easy don t overdose on high calorie vegetarian foods figure out your weight loss goals track your food intake include aerobic exercise weekly incorporate strength training bump up your lifestyle activity manage your stress levels get enough sleep to help you figure out when to go meatless make yourself a meal plan it ll serve as guide to help you stay on track with your diet and not force you to find foods on the fly or tempt you with a quick drive through meal do a meal plan for one week write out every breakfast lunch dinner and snack that you will have each day if you re not making every meal meatless note which days or which meals need to be meatless plug these meals into a calorie counter or food journal app so you can get a total calorie count for each day if your calorie level is too high cut down on the serving size or snacks if it s too low add a snack to your day fixing yourself a meatless breakfast doesn t have to be hard or difficult you may be surprised at how many common breakfast foods are naturally meat free when you re looking for meatless breakfasts decide whether or not you want to include dairy foods or eggs these are considered vegetarian but not vegan if you are including dairy and eggs great meatless breakfast meal ideas can include cottage cheese with almonds and fruit a smoothie with spinach fruit and greek yogurt or an omelet with feta cheese tomatoes and onions if you want to avoid dairy and eggs try these vegan breakfast meals oatmeal with soy milk fruit and nuts tofu scrambled with peppers onions and spinach or chia seed pudding with fruit if your normal lunch meal is a burger or cold cut sandwich it can be difficult to figure out an alternative option however there are a lot of great items that are meatless and are good for lunches great vegetarian lunches that include dairy products include a greek wrap with spinach feta cheese hummus peppers and olives a 1 2 grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup a black bean and cheese quesadilla with sliced avocado or a homemade protein pack with sliced cheese nuts and fruit vegan lunch ideas include 3 bean chili curried chickpea salad in a whole wheat wrap vegetable barley soup or a cold sesame noodle salad with tofu and steamed vegetables many people find dinner hard to make meatless it s very common especially in more westernized countries to feature a meat as the main course of an evening meal if you re used to having a piece of chicken steak fish or even a pork chop at dinner it can be difficult to switch gears towards meatless meals to start serve up some common meatless meals they re probably something you ve been eating anyways for example try whole wheat spaghetti and marinara sauce vegetable stir fry cheese pizza on whole wheat crust or try a quiche with vegetables and cheese get a little more creative with this meal by trying meat replacements you can use soy crumbles in the place of ground meat veggie burgers in the place of hamburgers or vegan sausages in the place of italian sausage other ideas you can try include quinoa salad with diced vegetables beans and feta cheese a caprese sandwich with mozzarella tomatoes and pesto spinach and cheese stuffed shells or stuffed portobello mushrooms with tomato sauce spinach and cheese to help you go meatless get your family involved they can provide a lot of support and may also benefit from this new diet change talk to your family about your weight loss goals and desire to go meatless ask for them to be supportive of you as you make changes to your diet and lifestyle also ask if anyone would like to join you as you incorporate more meatless meals or ask if they d mind if a few days during the week everyone ate meatless meals together it might be fun to research recipes together and cook new meals for everyone to try if everyone isn t on board with meatless meals ask if a few meals a week could be meatless or if they d mind preparing their own meals so that you could focus on preparing meatless meals part of weight loss is choosing leaner cuts of protein fortunately many of the vegetarian and vegan protein sources are naturally low in calories protein is essential to any healthy diet but it s particularly important for weight loss it ll help keep you satisfied and fuel your metabolism include at least once serving of protein at each meal measure out a 3 4 oz portion or a 1 2 cup serving vegetarian protein sources to consider include dairy products eggs nuts beans lentils tofu tempeh seitan and vegan meat replacements like veggie burgers vegan cheese or vegetarian sausages meatless options to try include a tofu and vegetable stir fry poached eggs with asparagus lentil and bean chili or a grilled tempeh reuben fruits and vegetables are common in meatless meals include a variety of these items and try making them the star of your meatless meal for example you could have a cauliflower steak by cutting a large central piece out of a cauliflower and grilling it it can be difficult to figure out what to eat for a meatless meal but instead of focusing on what protein is the main part of the meal try using a fruit or a vegetable as the main course not only are fruits and vegetables perfect for vegan and vegetarian diets they re also high in fiber high fiber diets like protein can help you feel full with less food and keep you satisfied longer try to include at least 1 2 servings of either a fruit or vegetable at each meal measure out a 1 2 cup of fruit or 1 small piece 1 cup of vegetables or about 2 cups of leafy greens meatless ideas to try include sweet potato enchiladas a spinach salad with berries baked eggplant parmesan or stuffed artichokes in addition to fruits and vegetables whole grains are a vegetarian food that can help provide additional nutrients to your diet just be sure to choose 100 whole grains even without meatless meals it s still recommended to choose 100 whole grains these nutrient rich foods contain higher protein fiber and other minerals compared to refined grains whole grains like all foods should be portion controlled measure out 2 oz or about 1 2 cup of grains per serving 100 whole grains to try include quinoa millet farro barley whole wheat pasta or whole wheat bread meatless meals to try include quinoa breakfast porridge whole grain spaghetti with marinara sauce whole wheat pizza crust with your favorite toppings or a vegetable and barley soup regardless of whether or not you re trying to lose weight working more meatless meals into your diet can be difficult at first make it a bit easier by following some of these tips start with your favorite meatless meals if you want to go meatless you don t have to always find totally new recipes start by thinking of meals you already make that are meatless and incorporate these more often for example spaghetti and tomato sauce bean and cheese burritos or vegetable soup are already meat free take a little help from the store there are a variety of meat free items that can make adapting current meals easier for example use veggie burgers in place of beef burgers or use veggie meat crumbles in place of ground beef try more global cuisine many global cuisines like indian or thai have dishes that are meat free as well this can be a fun way to experiment with new foods and flavors while sticking to your meatless meal plan in order to make sure you meet your weight loss goals you need to be careful and choosy when picking out meatless foods and meals not everything that s considered vegetarian or vegan is also considered healthy or nutritious the lack of meat or animal products doesn t automatically make something a better or healthier choice for example cheese pizza french fries milkshakes and mac and cheese are all considered meatless meals however they re also not the healthiest nor will they aid in your weight loss efforts your meatless meals should be primarily lean protein fruits and vegetables stay away from items that are high in fat high sugar or overly high in calories for example limit or avoid chips crackers cookies cakes pies ice cream fried foods and fast foods to start your meatless meal weight loss plan you ll need to set a weight goal this will help you determine a calorie level to follow and provide guidance on what meals to include in your diet to start make sure you have realistic expectations about weight loss remember it s not safe or recommended to lose a lot of weight too quickly in general most health professionals only recommend aiming for a 1 2 pound weight loss per week this slower rate of weight loss is considered safer and more sustainable long term you re more likely to keep off that weight loss instead of regaining it for example if you want to lose 10 pounds it ll take just over a month to hit this goal once you ve come up with your weight loss goals start tracking your foods this will provide insight into what you eat how you eat and where meatless meals will be the most effective for you to start track your meals and snacks in a food journal track every breakfast lunch dinner snack and calorie containing beverage that you have during an entire day the more accurate you are with your tracking the more reliable your results will be and the more helpful they ll be using your food journal tally up your total calorie intake after each day to lose that 1 2 pounds a week and have safe and sustainable weight loss you ll need to cut out about 500 750 calories from your day this can be your target calorie goal each day to help you lose 1 2 pounds per week note you need a minimum of 1200 calories a day so you prevent nutrient deficiencies low energy and fatigue and weakness in addition to making changes to your diet it s also important to make changes to your lifestyle adding in aerobic activity is an important part of a healthy life and to weight loss aerobic activities are those exercises that increase your heart rate and breathing pace they help burn extra calories that will aid in weight loss in general health professionals recommend that you include about 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity each week you can split this up throughout the week as needed however in order to count towards this goal you need to be doing an activity for at least 10 minutes exercises to try include walking jogging cycling dancing hiking swimming taking an aerobics class or rowing in addition to aerobic exercise also add in strength training this form of exercise is an additional way to help your body burn more calories strength training helps support weight loss by building more muscle mass the more muscle you have the more calories your body burns even at rest health professionals recommend that you include 1 2 days of strength training each week in addition to your cardio activities you need to do a variety of exercises to work each major muscle group and be working out for at least 20 minutes try weight lifting body weight exercises pilates or yoga these all count towards strength training outside of both cardiovascular and strength training activities you can also increase your calorie burn with lifestyle activities it s a great way to stay active and support weight loss lifestyle activities are the exercises that you do as a part of your normal daily routine they do not burn many calories by themselves but over the course of the day can add up they include activities like sweeping the floor doing the laundry walking through the grocery store taking the stairs or gardening try to be more active during the day by increasing the amount of time you spend doing these activities think of ways to take more steps stand more often or just move more in general be sure to reduce the amount of time that you spend sitting down because this can have negative effects on your health regardless of what type of diet you follow you should try to manage your stress levels if you are chronically stressed you may find it difficult to lose weight even while following a meatless meal plan stress even low grade stress can elevate different hormones in your body these hormones make you hungrier crave higher calorie foods and can slow your metabolism to help manage your stress try meditating going for a walk listening to music reading a good book closing your eyes or talking to a friend if you re having difficulty managing your stress or its seriously affecting your weight or ability to lose weight consider talking to a behavioral therapist or counselor for additional help similar to stress not sleeping well can make weight loss more difficult to support weight loss try to get a good night s sleep as often as you can when you don t sleep enough or don t sleep well the next day you will be more hungry this is because there is increase secretion of hunger hormones which increase your appetite and craving for higher calorie foods in addition if you re feeling fatigued you re more than likely going to skip a workout and be more tempted to take a short cut with your meals aim for at least 7 9 hours of sleep each night you might need to go to bed earlier or wake up later to meet that guideline 
query	150	learn about ancient egypt ancient egypt was a powerful and fascinating nation whose great engineering feats are still something of a mystery to us today egypt was a main center of power and is one of the great civilizations whose relationships with neighboring greek roman and other empires made it play an important role in the area so much so that the roman republic was scandalized by the control a certain cleopatra had over its rulers the basic timeline the basics of egyptian society daily life be familiar with the basic time frame of ancient egypt explore the religion and mythology of egypt learn about the technology medicine science of ancient egypt learn about the government social structure and laws of egypt learn about the cuisine of ancient egypt learn about the home life of an ancient egyptian explore more facets of ancient egypt egypt is a truly ancient kingdom which history dates around 120 000 years bc and has led a cherished life until it was conquered by the romans and was part of various empires in later years including the ottoman french and british empires it is not clear when egyptian history truly started although by 5500 bc communities were settling around the nile and developing agriculture this era is typically known as the pre dynastic period the climate was far less arid then than it is now with much of the land covered with savannah and grasslands the early dynastic period started around 3050bce is typically formed by the uniting of two kingdoms upper egypt which paradoxically is in the south of egypt and lower egypt which is in the northern nile delta regions this period developed the powerful institution of the pharaohs which were critical to its stability regional influence and survival in 2868 bc the period known as the old kingdom started it was within this age that greater developments started such as a justice system taxation system and other levels of governance as well as more advanced crop management the practice of creating pyramids started in this era creating what would become many cities of the dead which are known as necropolis in this age were the building of the pyramids of giza and the sphinx among many others in 2181 bc power struggles as well as over a century of famine conditions weakened the structure of egypt and created what is known as the first intermediate period this period lasted a relatively short time as egypt had re split into upper and lower egypt and the period ended when the two rival dynasties went to war with the winners being upper egypt who ruled from thebes in 2134 bc the pharaohs of the upper kingdom had reunited egypt and set to restore the countries prosperity this era is known as the middle kingdom and an age when egypt controlled great wealth from agriculture precious metals and led to a great revival of arts literature and architecture this kingdom collapsed yet again due to famine and restive migrants 1674 bc was the start of the second intermediate period in this age the pharaohs power was heavily reduced and was expected to pay tribute to what were seen as foreign rulers that are known as hyksos however they did absorb egyptian culture as a way to hold power and introduced many new inventions the pharaoh s court was forced to remain at the old capital where it was kept busy by an old enemy nubia sudan ethiopia to the south and the hyksos to the north by 1549bce the pharaohs had gradually built the military and defeated both nubia and the hyksos which lead to the new kingdom in this age the egyptian empire was at its largest and saw a great period of arts monument building and literature this age built vast wealth however as its religious institutions become too powerful the nation fractured once again the third intermediate period lasted for quite some time starting from 1069 bc and was ruled by many dynasties including many libyan princes while the empire regained power wealth and prestige it also was a period with many wars that led to an eventual decline by 672bce the two kingdoms were reunited and this is known as the late period in this age egypt was threatened by many different kingdoms and was eventually conquered the the greeks in 332bce by alexander the great the ptolemaic period was 3 centuries ruled by greek dynasties however the hellenistic culture did not overthrow the ancient culture and the greek rulers absorbed the local culture and religion to hold power 30 bce is marked by the famous story of cleopatra arguably the last true independent pharaoh of egypt but does not count as the last egyptian pharaoh which was before the invasion by greece the stories say that cleopatra having failed to fend off a roman invasion during a roman civil war with her roman lover mark antony and committed suicide after which egypt swiftly fell to the romans egypt had an enormous variety of different creation myths legends as well as gods and goddesses this lasted until 391 when the christian emperors eroded and banned any traditional institutions eventually christianity gave way to islam which is the majority religion today in ancient egypt the location of the nile was important the living lived on the east of the nile where the sun rose and in a rite of passage the deceased were taken to the west of the nile which were the lands of the dead the tradition of placing pennies in the coffin or on the corpse to pay for the ferryman comes from ancient egypt deities were not always seen as benevolent and the faithful prayed to them for protection against their wrath this pattern also created many of the animal gods such as the hippopotamus a most dangerous creature as well as other predators the overall system was complex and the priests typically made little effort to unify the religion and resolve conflicting myths this in many ways did not seem to pose a major problem as it would today egypt was also the place where the worlds first recorded monotheistic religion started long before the current religions of today this was a short lived period ruled by akhenaten who worshiped a sun god known as aten after this king died his successor tutankhaten revived the old ways and changed his name to tutankhamun cementing his power by invoking the old sun god amun the later transfer from the old religions to christianity was not a smooth transition with the mathematician and philosopher hypatia later murdered outside a large church during a time of political rivalry as a scapegoat this event is sometimes marked as the end of the classical civilization the pharaohs and the nobles were mummified as a way to ensure their pathway to eternal paradise was safe to help preserve the body parts were extracted including the brain through the nose and stored in canopic jars they often took furniture gold food and slaves in early days slaves were entombed alive with the pharaoh but later sculptural images were made to represent them as things to enjoy in the next world egyptian temples were slightly different to greek and roman temples the god occupied a small sanctum or chamber and the priests dealt directly with the god the common person usually didn t even get close but used the priest as an intermediary on very special occasions the image of the god was taken out into the public space for worship gods served as an important role not only in life but in death a person who traveled to the underworld had their heart weighed on a pair of scales against the feather of truth while they were interrogated by the gods about their life should their heart be heavy also if they lie their heart would be fed to a demon monster and that person would then be damned visit design and make a canopic jar embalm make a mummy for more insights about the methods they used egypt was quite advanced in its time in medicine the stone ground flour was gritty and wore down egyptians teeth the close proximity to the nile bought parasites malaria and other diseases and a lot of work related injuries many mummies reveal the wealthy were often overweight from a rich diet adult life expectancy for egyptians was around 35 and with infant mortality high with 1 3 of infants dying the egyptians lived fast and died young and death was a central facet of their philosophy egyptian doctors were highly specialized so that there were doctors for specific ailments egyptians at quite an early age used bandages set bones stitched wounds performed dentistry amputated limbs had an understanding of anatomy and even created prosthetic in medicine they used honey as an antiseptic herbal medicines and opium for pain management many of these are still used today in processed forms but not all medicines actually worked some of them have been shown to have no curative properties relied on sorcery and some even contained animal dung egyptians were early and very skilled in glass making creating their own type of glass known as faience they made many household and decorative objects as well as tiles out of glass they were also expert shipbuilders mastering the art as early as 3000 bc as their location on the nile river as well as access to the mediterranean sea made ships a highly useful tool to trade and transport wares the ancient egyptians were expert mathematicians and engineers which was an important skill not only around the nation but for building the great monuments egypt is famous for while it is still open to debate how the egyptians created vast palaces temples pillars obelisks pyramids and other structures it is certain the egyptians were skilled at the architectural sciences other important early development are paper from papyrus art and painting precision tools mining irrigation astronomy metal smelting ceramics pigment making and masonry visit make papyrus build a karel drbal pyramid read egyptian hieroglyphics multiply like the ancient egyptians for more insight into their language science and mathematics egypt had as principal the pharaoh who enacted most laws while egypt does not seem to have had a fixed legal code like the modern world or one that has survived most cases were resolved by arbitration between local elders in a common sense methodology preferring mediation or an agreement between the two severe crimes tended to be referred to the pharaoh the vizier to judge the system was complex for these cases as the judge was also the prosecutor and the plaintiff and defendant in the case had to defend their own cases punishments were often severe and extended to the family of the criminal egyptian society was very class conscious and unlike the greeks had little fluidity between the hierarchical classes after the pharaoh came the scribes officials and then the priests doctors engineers and other scholars below them came the craftsmen and workers below them were the farm workers and at the bottom of the ladder were the slave populations however ancient egypt like greece did have an equal system for men and women where they were equal under the law and all classes except the slaves could petition to have their case heard and resolved egyptian women were more free than their descendants in the modern religions both men and women could also marry own property sell and trade inherit and make contracts equally which was unlike many of egypt s neighbors the downside is that they tended to have less access to education if their family did not persist in it did not always occupy high positions in administration and that while many women ruled as pharaoh they often wore a symbolic and prosthetic beard to represent masculine strength the military defended the nation and was typically recruited from the populace but in later years which caused much strife relied on mercenaries and foreign troops egypt however had a very centralized and well managed economy in which the temples played in a key role as many granaries and good pasture was in the temple property all products bought and wages paid were on a fixed rate so inflation was heavily controlled workers were paid in a fixed rate of grain of which they could barter with and administrators were paid in grain and silver or copper enforced recruitment was known during times of pyramid and monument building which seeing the short life expectancy was quite often as well as times of civil war which was also fairly common egypt was a world spice center and an important part of the world as the fertile valley around the nile had regular flood and dry periods which allowed new silt rich to improve the soil this gave egypt regular crop surpluses in good years but like today the nile is still the life source of egypt like many other cultures the ancient egyptians relied a lot of beer as a beverage as the nile water was unsafe to drink this beer was often thick cloudy and nutritious almost to being a watery porridge or gruel wine was imported or made locally but beer was the beverage for the common people vegetables could be grown almost year round and included a lot of onions and garlic lettuce pulses and beans especially lentils and chickpeas as well as varieties of cucumber gourd and water plant tubers fruits included melons dates nuts figs grapes and pomegranates coconuts were imported from the tropics at great expense and by the roman period they had a range of stone fruits such as apple pear plums and quince as well as almonds walnuts and pistachios the ancient egyptian diet was low in sugar but the egyptians did like their sweet dishes which were frequently made of honey sweet carob pods dates and figs in the early dynasties when the nile valley was lush and green meat was a common staple which included antelope birds such as duck geese and quail as well as ostrich crocodile and even hippo and porcupine they also farmed cows goats sheep and pigs for consumption and fished often but fish was more a commoner s diet where further north in rome greece fish was incredibly expensive other staples include breads cheese and eggs but for the poorer people bread beer and legumes or pulses tended to be the main foundations the egyptian home varied according to the wealth of the inhabitant basic homes were typically mud brick houses often with white painted walls reed mat carpets decorative fabric wall hangings and a semi detached kitchen which was usually made without a roof to be able to let the heat and smoke of the fires out of the house the egyptian bed was usually a solid wooden frame bed with a reed mat if any for padding the beds often doubled up as seating during the day there was no pillow but a headrest made from wood or metal as the only additional comfort the egyptians enjoyed theater although as the climate is excessively hot it was never as big as the greeks and romans who built vast amphitheater and circus arenas however the abydos passion play is still likely to be the world s oldest existent play clothing in ancient egypt was very egalitarian both men and women wore a large folded piece of bleached white linen while children wore no clothes until they were 12 after which they were given clothing and had their heads shaved popular past times includes board games such as senet mehen unfortunately the rules have long been lost so it is unknown how to play this game and hounds and jackals for the youth ball games wrestling and games such as marbles made from old knuckle bones were popular egyptian games didn t have dice so used a series or color coded sticks or bones to create values the wealthy classes often enjoyed hunting and fishing but the poorer classes were typically tied to their farms and so had little time for leisure during the day hygiene was very important which in a hot climate is an important consideration as well as for religion men and women bathed often if not daily and used a soap made from oils and sand or fat and crushed chalk men often shaved their entire bodies and both genders used scented ointments as a perfume women often used a mirror made of polished bronze and both genders used kohl which is an eye makeup with medicinal as well as sun protective qualities the egyptians loved music and parties although they were expensive common instruments included a wide range such as drums cymbals bells flutes trumpets pipe instruments lyres and harps egyptian palaces were much grander affairs often featuring great painted murals polished stone and fine furnishings often expensive wood such as cedar imported from elsewhere to be able to express the great wealth of egypt visit play senet for an idea about the worlds oldest board game you can learn from online sources documentaries visiting museums as well as from history experts to gain an insight into an empire culture and its people whose effects can still be felt today within the modern world 
query	151	calculate the volume of a square pyramid a square pyramid is a three dimensional solid characterized by a square base and sloping triangular sides that meet at a single point above the base if s displaystyle s represents the length of one of the square base s sides and h displaystyle h represents the height of the pyramid the perpendicular distance from the the base to the point the volume of a square pyramid can be calculated with the formula v 1 3 s 2 h displaystyle v frac 1 3 s 2 h it doesn t matter whether the pyramid is the size of a paperweight or larger than the great pyramid of giza this formula works for any square pyramid the volume can also be calculated using what is called the slant height of the pyramid finding volume using base area and height finding volume using slant height finding volume using the edge height measure the side length of the base calculate the area of the base multiply the area of the base by the pyramid s height divide this answer by 3 measure the pyramid s slant height imagine a right triangle assign variables to the values use the pythagorean theorem to calculate the perpendicular height use the height and base to calculate volume measure the pyramid s edge height assign variables calculate the diagonal of the square base find the side of the base from the diagonal use the side and height to calculate volume since by definition square pyramids have bases that are perfectly square all of the sides of the base should be equal in length thus for a square pyramid you only need to find the length of one side consider a pyramid whose base is a square with side lengths of s 5cm displaystyle s 5 text cm this is the value you will use to find the area of the base if the sides of the base are not equal in length you have a rectangular pyramid rather than a square pyramid the volume formula for rectangular pyramids is very similar to the formula for square pyramids if l displaystyle l represents the length of the rectangular pyramid s base and w displaystyle w represents its width the pyramid s volume is v 13h l w displaystyle v frac 1 3 h l w finding the volume begins by finding the two dimensional area of the base this is done by multiplying the base s length times its width because the base of a square pyramid is a square its sides all have equal lengths so the area of the base is equal to the length of one side squared times itself in the example since the side lengths of the pyramid s base are all 5 cm you can find the base s area as area s2 5cm 2 25cm2 displaystyle text area s 2 5 text cm 2 25 text cm 2 remember that two dimensional areas are expressed in square units square centimeters square meters square miles and so on next multiply the base area by the height of the pyramid as a reminder the height is the distance of the line segment stretching from the apex of the pyramid to the plane of the base at perpendicular angles to both in the example suppose the pyramid has a height of 9 cm in this case multiply the area of the base by this value as follows 25cm2 9cm 225cm3 displaystyle 25 text cm 2 9 text cm 225 text cm 3 remember that volumes are expressed in cubic units in this case because all the linear measurements are centimeters the volume is in cubic centimeters finally find the volume of the pyramid by dividing the value you just found from multiplying the base area by the height by 3 this will give you a final answer that represents the volume of the square pyramid in the example divide 225 cm3 by 3 to get an answer of 75 cm3 for the volume sometimes you will not be told the perpendicular height of the pyramid instead you may be told or may have to measure the pyramid s slant height with the slant height you will be able to use the pythagorean theorem to calculate the perpendicular height a pyramid s slant height is the distance from its apex to the midpoint of one of the base sides measure to the midpoint of the side and not to one of the corners of the base for this example assume that you measure the slant height to be 13 cm and you are told that the side length is 10 cm as a reminder the pythagorean theorem can be expressed as the equation a2 b2 c2 displaystyle a 2 b 2 c 2 where a displaystyle a and b displaystyle b are the perpendicular legs of the right triangle and c displaystyle c is the hypotenuse to use the pythagorean theorem you need a right triangle imagine a right triangle slicing through the middle of the pyramid and perpendicular to the base of the pyramid the slant height of the pyramid called l displaystyle l is the hypotenuse of this right triangle the base of this right triangle is one half the length of s displaystyle s the side of the square base of the pyramid the pythagorean theorem uses the variables a b and c but it helps to replace those with variables that have meaning for your problem the slant height l displaystyle l takes the place of c displaystyle c in the pythagorean theorem the leg of the right triangle which is s2 displaystyle frac s 2 takes the place of b displaystyle b you will be solving for the height of the pyramid h displaystyle h which takes the place of a displaystyle a in the pythagorean theorem this substitution will look like this a2 b2 c2 displaystyle a 2 b 2 c 2 h2 s2 2 l2 displaystyle h 2 frac s 2 2 l 2 insert the measured values of s 10 displaystyle s 10 and l 13 displaystyle l 13 then proceed to solve the equation h2 l2 s2 2 displaystyle h 2 l 2 frac s 2 2 original equation h l2 s2 2 displaystyle h sqrt l 2 frac s 2 2 square root both sides h 132 102 2 displaystyle h sqrt 13 2 frac 10 2 2 substitute values h 169 52 displaystyle h sqrt 169 5 2 simplify fraction h 169 25 displaystyle h sqrt 169 25 simplify square h 144 displaystyle h sqrt 144 subtract h 12 displaystyle h 12 simplify square root after using the calculations with the pythagorean theorem you now have the information you need to calculate the volume of the pyramid as you normally would use the formula v 13s2h displaystyle v frac 1 3 s 2 h and solve making sure to label your answer in cubic units from the calculations the height of the pyramid is 12 cm use this and the base side of 10 cm to calculate the pyramid s volume v 13s2h displaystyle v frac 1 3 s 2 h v 13 102 12 displaystyle v frac 1 3 10 2 12 v 13 100 12 displaystyle v frac 1 3 100 12 v 400cm3 displaystyle v 400 text cm 3 the edge height is the length of the edge of the pyramid measured from the apex to one of the corners of the pyramid s base as before you will then use the pythagorean theorem to calculate the perpendicular height of the pyramid for this example assume that the edge height can be measured to be 11 cm and you are given that the perpendicular height is 5 cm as before you need a right triangle to use the pythagorean theorem in this case however your unknown value is the base of the pyramid you know the perpendicular height and the edge height if you imagine cutting the pyramid diagonally from one corner to the opposite corner and opening it up the exposed inside face is a triangle the height of that triangle is the perpendicular height of the pyramid it divides the exposed triangle into two symmetrical right triangles the hypotenuse of either right triangle is the edge height of the pyramid the base of either right triangle is one half the diagonal of the base of the pyramid use this imaginary right triangle and assign values to the pythagorean theorem you know the perpendicular height h displaystyle h which is one leg of the pythagorean theorem a displaystyle a the edge height of the pyramid l displaystyle l is the hypotenuse of this imaginary right triangle so it takes the place of c displaystyle c the unknown diagonal of the base of the pyramid is the remaining leg of the right triangle b displaystyle b after you make these substitutions the equation will look like this a2 b2 c2 displaystyle a 2 b 2 c 2 h2 b2 l2 displaystyle h 2 b 2 l 2 you will need to rearrange the equation to isolate the variable b displaystyle b and then solve for its value h2 b2 l2 displaystyle h 2 b 2 l 2 revised equation b2 l2 h2 displaystyle b 2 l 2 h 2 substitute h2 from both sides b l2 h2 displaystyle b sqrt l 2 h 2 square root both sides b 112 52 displaystyle b sqrt 11 2 5 2 insert numerical values b 121 25 displaystyle b

query	152	grow gourds gourds have been used for centuries as decoration as for their usefulness as tools and utensils whether you want the crop for artistic purposes or you just like the colorful squash sitting in your field growing gourds at home is easy preparing to plant propagating the seeds planting your gourds harvesting your gourds choose a variety of gourd determine when to plant decide whether or not to use a trellis select a planting location prepare the soil scarify the seeds soak the seeds let the seeds dry start your seeds dig rows and create hills plant the gourds care for your newly planted gourds consider training ornamental gourds leave the gourds to cure on the vine remove the gourds treat the shell of the gourd consider saving the seeds gourds come in dozens of species each with its own unique shape color and size gourds come in three general types ornamental gourds cucurbita utilitarian gourds lagenaria and vegetable sponge gourds luffa also consider including a few different kinds of edible gourds ornamental gourds are brightly colored and oddly shaped typically used as decoration the have orange and yellow flowers utilitarian gourds are green while growing and then dry a brown shade these gourds are most often used for tools and utensils because of their tough shell vegetable sponge gourds have a shell that can be peeled off revealing a center that can be used as a sponge these have yellow flowers while growing while not all gourds are edible many are you can eat butternut squash cushaw festival squash golden acorn and more some other edible gourds include balsam apple chinese okra hercules war club and young luffa gourds will grow in most climate zones but they grow the best in hot weather if you re in a location that receives freezing temperatures throughout most of the winter you will have to start your gourds as seeds indoors prior to sowing them outside gourds take about 180 days total from planting till they produce ripe fruit as a result of their extra long germination process keep in mind that if you re in a cold area you ll need to start your seeds 6 8 weeks before the last frost of the season gourds grow best in temperatures between 75 and 85 degrees fahrenheit starting gourds indoors simply involves planting the seeds in individual containers setting up a few grow lights and watering on a daily basis trellises are wood or wire constructs built to hold plants off the ground and in the case of gourds are used primarily to encourage unique shapes you do not need a trellis to grow your gourds as they will grow fine on the ground however gourds that grow on the ground will have a flat side where they lay while gourds that grow on trellises will maintain their rounded shapes if you decide to use a trellis set it up prior to planting your gourds and then stake the plants to it over time large heavy varieties like bottle gourds will require a combination wood and heavy wire trellis in order to support them without falling over small gourd varieties can be grown using a large tomato cage as the trellis luffa vegetable sponge gourds almost always need to be trellised using trellises can help prevent your gourds from getting diseases gourds should be planted outdoors in full sunlight with plenty of space to sprawl although they can be grown in pots this will significantly limit their size and overall production if you re planting your gourds without a trellis choose a space with plenty of square footage for growth otherwise stake your trellis out in a wide area with plenty of sunlight and little shade plant your seeds a least 8 10 feet apart in order to properly prevent diseases from forming and spreading it isn t too tricky to get soil under the proper conditions for gourds which makes them easy to grow in most locations the soil needs to be well drained and warm they like plenty of moisture with a bit more clay than sand meaning they may not thrive in sandy soil test the ph of your garden plot to see if it is somewhere between 5 8 and 6 4 which is the best range for gourds if your ph is too high incorporate peat moss to increase the acidity if the air is warm but the ground is still cold the gourd plants won t grow well gourds are infamous for their tough outer seed shell which is partly responsible for their extra long germination period to prevent your seeds gourds from rotting because they took too long to germinate you can scarify them to speed the process use an emery board paper nail file or a smooth sandpaper to scratch up the outer surface of the seeds this shouldn t take too long the rough paper should just roughen the coating of both sides of the seed after the seeds have been scarified place them in a bowl of lukewarm water and allow them to soak this should be done for a total of 24 hours in order to help speed up the germination process after soaking for 24 hours remove the seeds from the water and lay them out to dry on a piece of wax paper giving them time to completely dry out will prevent them from rotting before even sprouting it s a good idea to give your seeds a head start even if you re in a warmer area by planting them in starter sets indoors fill small seed trays with your prepared soil and place a single seed in each slot give daily watering until you re ready to transplant the sprouts outdoors typically after the last frost of the winter make sure the seeds get plenty of light to keep them from getting too leggy excessively long and straggly stemmed later on in the location you ve selected for your garden plot use a small trowel or shovel to prepare your rows and hills or small mounds of earth for the gourd seedlings if you re planting many gourds at once make sure to follow the seed packet spacing directions strictly gourds typically need to be planted several feet away from each other in order to thrive keep your rows near your trellis if you re using one place each small seedling or seed into its own individual hill don t group several in the same space cover up the seeds with inch of dirt and cover seedlings to the base of the new growth at planting water the gourd seeds heavily so as to reduce the risk of transplant shock gourds like plenty of moisture so make sure the soil is damp by adding water on a daily basis if necessary remove weeds as they sprout as these will steal valuable nutrients and growing space from the gourds if you re using a trellis as the gourds grow in size you can use a bit of string to secure them to the posts and give them plenty of room for growth add a layer of mulch to the garden plot to lock in moisture and block out new weeds consider incorporating an equal part fertilizer like a 10 10 10 mixture to the soil every few months give your gourds extra water when the weather is particularly dry or hot to maintain a high level of moisture in the soil if you re growing ornamental gourds it is common for growers to train them into interesting shapes and structures there are two general ways to train the shape of a gourd bending over time and by giving it a mold you can slowly bend parts of a gourd as it grows if you want a winding snake like gourd in the end you can also create a mold for your gourd by placing the small fruit inside a breakable vessel of some sort like a vase when the gourd has grown it will fill the container and match its shape you simply have to break the mold to remove it when done when your gourds have reached their full size the vine they re growing on will start to die off on its own at this point your gourds are ready for harvesting but you ll make the job a lot easier on yourself if you leave them to cure on the vine give them several weeks to a month for the curing process to occur as you check in on them you ll notice them getting lighter and lighter unless you notice animals and bugs eating the gourds there s no fear of rotting or going bad if you re harvesting edible gourds they ll need to be removed from the vine when they re still young if you have to cut the gourds early wait till the vine at the top of the gourd has turned completely brown and dry turn the gourds occasionally and move them around to keep them from touching the curing time varies from gourd to gourd depending on its size and therefore water content check the gourds on a weekly basis to tell if they re ready feel the skin and check the firmness of the gourds if they are at all soft or squishy they are rotten and should be thrown out when the skin feels hard and slightly waxy to the touch they are likely ready to be cut shake the gourd as the final test to see if they are fully cured if they are ready they ll sound like a rattle with the seeds banging around on the inside use a pair of scissors or shears to cut the gourds from the vine although it is not required you can treat the shell of the gourd to change its appearance and to help it last longer wash the gourd with a bit of dish detergent and warm water to kill off any bacteria you can then use a bit of sandpaper or steel wool to shine the outside of the gourd and add a layer of wax or shellac to finish off the shine you can decorate gourds by painting the outsides as well your gourd will last for many years with the seeds inside but if you would like to save the seeds for the next year s planting you may do so cut the gourd open to remove the seeds from the inside follow the same process of propagating the seeds as aforementioned to help speed up their growth you can keep the shell of the old gourd and you ll have the seeds to create plenty of new gourds as well

query	154	learn about ancient greece ancient greece was a powerful nation whose empirical conquests are the thing of legend creating in its day one of the world s largest empires stretching from greece to the himalayas its contribution to the sciences and philosophies are felt in today s society and is reckoned to have been the source of western civilisation this tutorial will explore how to learn about ancient greece as well as try some ancient greek experiences the basic timeline the basics of greek society daily life be familiar with the basic time frame of ancient greece consider the social structure of greece explore the religion and mythology of greece learn about the philosophy and science of ancient greece explore the culture of ancient greece learn about the cuisine of ancient greece dress in the clothing of ancient greece explore more facets of ancient greece greece as an empire was active some time before the roman empire starting around 800bce and continued until the romans conquered it before 800bce is a period often referred to as the greek dark ages and the subsequent era is often called the archaic era this was where the great cities philosophies and sciences theatre classical art law and the greek language being written down were starting to set seed this era had many rulers known as tyrants a word we still use today whose gradual overthrow paved the way towards greek democracy and the athenian model of government this era artistically had influences from egypt and what we call today as the middle east and is often called the orientalization of greece after the last tyrant overthrow in 510 bce this heralded the start of the classical period that is perhaps the most famous its bedrock moment arrived because of the athenians successfully defending greece from a persian invasion and this period continues to the hellenistic civilisation starting in 323bce this era is where the empire becomes dominant with alexander the great rising to power and expanding the empire through to india where he eventually turned back this era ends with his death in 323bce which leads to the hellenistic era the hellenistic era focuses more on maintaining the empire but ends in 146bce when the divided greek empire falls under roman conquest and becomes part of the roman empire ancient greece had a clear social structure but was more flexible in some areas greece in many ways was more democratic than its ancient neighbour rome as social status did not give additional rights democracy itself is a greek word there was four main social classes in athens yet if one earned more money and chattels they themselves could climb the social ladder education was an important factor for climbing the social ladder as most rights were awarded once the education was completed but education was an expensive and private engagement with the family employing a tutor only sparta seems to have had publicly funded and obligatory education slavery was common in greece however there were differences between greece and rome the greeks generally treated slaves far better than the romans with beating and killing them as forbidden and many slaves were offered their freedom as an agreement to work better the population of slaves however varies by accounts of being the majority of the populace but it is still clear they were a significant part of the population and many held roles in public service unlike the romans slaves were not accorded the rights of citizen after freedom and they were part of their own social group known as a metic in sparta however things were far harsher for slaves and a group of slaves from conquered armies were often killed in a rite of passage for spartans serving in the army was often compulsory for men as it was not only a way to maintain and defend the empire but also to give skills in engineering and management before christianity became mainstream in 529 ad greek religion was pantheistic and included worship of heroes as an important factor one of the central dynamics of the religion focused on the epic conflict between the gods on mt olympus and the titans the gods titans feature within the same creation myth but were divided between them and frequently at war the gods and goddesses are biographical and personalised than roman gods and these deities and legends had a complex relationship between themselves and humans the cult like worship of heroes such as heracles also known as hercules perseus achilles and their stories was important to greek society as they served as role models and sources of national pride the anti hero was also important which is not the villain of the story but are bland or non heroic characters that are least likely to be heroes but become or act heroically indian and other religions were also known to the ancient greeks with one king who is commonly referred to menander i soter or melinda in the indo greek world who had embraced buddhism and reigned around 150bce ruling a significant eastern part of the empire this region had influenced greek architecture which in turn strongly influenced the roman models yet heading the other way the influence spread as far as japan the greeks also set great store in oracles and prophecies such as the famous oracle of delphi oracles would often fall into a trance and priests for those who had paid for the prophecy translated their expressions after the roman conquest many of the greek gods with synthesized were roman equivalents within rome this functioned in a way so a roman citizen could worship in greece but the synthesis also boosted the power of the roman gods most of the planets excepting earth mars and venus were named after greek gods goddesses visit know the twelve olympians of greek mythology to get some more background information on the heroes of greece these two fields were often part of the same school where today philosophy is a separate field and occasionally not seen as a science at all learn about some of the famous greek philosophers and scientists such as thales socrates plato aristotle epicures pythagoras zeno euclid archimedes and more early philosophers were more interested in science rather than wisdom but in the classical period wisdom ethics good governance and other virtues became equally important greece was often at war with various nations within greece such as athens and sparta but also outside of greece with the persian world and other nations so philosophy was an important science the greek language has contributed much to our modern language as many of our modern names for sciences come from ancient greece some examples are physics philosophy astronomy geography mathematics and cartography other interesting technologies and inventions include cranes for lifting road building the antikythera reckoned to be a complex astronomical calendar calipers astrolabes lighthouses showers waterwheels and many more including steam and water powered machinery visit for how to live like socrates argue using the socratic method do the philosophy of happiness diogenes epicurus understand stoicism for more ideas and insights about greek philosophy the greeks loved music dance poetry and theatre with tragic and comedic plays as well as the epics such as the odyssey and the illiad as well as stories of the battles between athens troy sparta and other nations which are classics still told today theatre really came into its own during the classical period after much of athens was destroyed by persian invasions this revival and rebuilding led a great re invention and revival of greek literature and the word thespian has its origins in greece the greeks attended plays in vast audiences as it was a major source of entertainment masks were a key costume part of greek theatre and some even had brass instruments fitted to act as a megaphone to amplify actors voices the famous duo of the two masks of comedy and tragedy as a symbol of the theatre has their roots in greek theatre some of the most famous plays and playwrights were sophocles who counted among his works the story of oedipus aristophanes who had many comedies but who also wrote the clouds a fictional spoof based on socrates which was later used to falsely implicate the philosopher as being immoral and consequently executed by drinking hemlock poison music in classic greece traditionally was an expression of philosophy as a metaphor of the harmonics of the universe with everything vibrating in harmony it was also an expression of ethos with certain pieces played at certain times according to their inherent qualities later music became more of an entertainment ancient greek music was arguably more varied than modern music as while we have tones and half tones greek tones went to quarter and even finer subtleties to be able to make perfect balance greek instruments include string wind and percussion instruments including pan pipes named after the greek god pan lyres and harps as well as a complex zither like instrument known as a kithara drums trumpets conch shells and a hydraulic organ known as a hydraulis these instruments later became absorbed into ancient roman music visit write an epic poem to learn how to create your own epic adventure in the greek style greece had essentially a mediterranean diet but it was not entirely as varied or rich as the modern cuisine of greece ancient greek cuisine was frugal and austere a major influence was the city of sparta which even today gives us the word spartan the ancient greeks loved their wine and a frequent way for men to pass the time was in a symposium which was basically an evening of a few men apart from female courtesans and entertainers women were typically forbidden from the event the meal as it was would feature snacks such as nuts grains and pulses as well as honey cakes to be able to prolong drinking like the romans great feasts were reserved more for religious grounds and the wealthy but they were still more austere than later roman empire extravagances bread was a staple ingredient mostly made from wheat or barley that was ground into a paste or dried to a flour leavened bread from yeast and other raising agents were used but later reserved for feast days only and bakery produced bread was expensive so most food was produced from scratch in homes vegetables typically featured vegetables such as cabbage onions garlic pulses such as peas chickpeas garbanzo beans and broad beans as well as lentils the poor often had their meals were including acorns bitter vetch and wild herbs fruits included figs pomegranates raisins and if available fresh grapes olives were an important ingredient as the plant would survive the hot dry climate and the infertile alkali soils of the region this provided olive oil as well as olives for pickling beverages typically included water which the greeks valued as a nutritious life giving drink and like a wine expert today can characterise and even judge its source so too could the water experts of the time wine was a common beverage typically cut with water as it was thought unmixed could be fatal or induce madness milk was not commonly drunk although it likely was due to the poor keeping qualities in the climate as milk was reserved for cheese meat was very important to the greek diet as fresh produce was often hard to grow and did not travel well if the poor had access to land they would typically raise geese and chickens but also hunted for game such as hare and game birds sausages were consumed across the classes but the cost of a piglet in the cities from a butcher was about the cost of 3 days wages cooked and salted meats were more common as fresh meat often required a religious ceremony where the fat and bones were cremated to honour the gods learn how to pickle olives make greek bean soup and make greek whole grain olive bread for some ideas greek clothing was typically home made and while in movies is often portrayed as an all white wardrobe greek fabrics were often vibrantly coloured and patterned no complete traditional costume has ever survived to modern times so much of what we know comes from artworks and mentions in ancient literature clothing was typically made of wool and linen often imported from egypt and other countries in the greek empire both men and women wore a costume known as a chiton which was a large rectangular piece of fabric often from the shoulder height to the floor of the wearer men often wore them to their knee height while women wore them to ankle length excess fabric resembled as a loose tunic it was pulled and secured with a belt or clasp below the breast or waist of the wearer the fabric was occasionally pleated to be more decorative men and soldiers often owned and used a cloak made from wool that was about the size of a blanket and often served as bedding at the same time it was usually hemmed with a border to protect it from fraying as well as adding a decorative edge the himation was a winter garment worn both genders over their chitons although sometimes it was worn instead of a chiton it was similar to in appearance but not as large as a roman toga women often wore veils and shawls both because modesty was an important virtue but also to protect them during travel and public events from the harsh sun and climate you can learn from online sources documentaries visiting museums as well as from history experts to gain an insight into an empire culture and its people whose effects can still be felt today within the modern world

query	158	write about a fictional city writing about a fictional city can a fun challenge we all know that real cities are sections of land with a population but in order to create a fictional city and use it in a story you will need to access your imagination and focus on the details on the city to get it right looking at examples of fictional cities creating the basics of the fictional city adding the specifics of the fictional city read several examples of fictional cities analyze the examples be aware of the pros and cons of using a fictional city instead of a real city consider basing your fictional city on a real city determine the name of the city create a historical record of the city describe the landscape and climate of the city note the demographics of the city draw a map of the city determine what makes the fictional city unique highlight details of the city that are essential to your story use the five senses add real life details to your city place the characters within the setting and have them move around describe the city through the perspectives of your characters to get a better sense of how to write a fictional city you should read up on several known examples of fictional cities fictional cities are often essential to the fictional world of a novel or book and they often complement or reinforce the characters and events that occur in the world of the book examples include the fictional city of basin city or sin city in frank miller s sin city the fictional city of king s landing in george r martin s a game of thrones the fictional city of oz the emerald city in l frank baum s the wizard of oz the fictional city of the shire in j r r tolkien s the hobbit once you have read through several examples of fictional cities you should take some time to consider what makes the examples so effective this will help you get a better sense of how to write about your fictional city most fictional cities are described using a map drawn by the author or by an illustrator working with the author examine the maps provided of the fictional cities and notice the level of detail that is put into the maps for example the map provided in j r r tolkien s the hobbit includes the names of places in the language of the novel as well as major landmarks and structures in the fictional area look at the naming of the areas or streets in the fictional city the names in a fictional city can carry a lot of importance as the names come to symbolize certain aspects of the world of the book for example the naming of sin city in frank miller s sin city graphic novels indicates that the area is known for its sinful inhabitants the name tells the reader something about the area and what to expect from the characters that live in the area note how the author describes the city does she use certain descriptions to characterize the city in the game of thrones by george r martin for example king s landing is described as dirty and smelly but it is also the seat of the throne this descriptions creates an interesting contrast for the reader though it may seem easier to set your story in a real city building a fictional city allows you to use your imagination and really delve into the possibilities of fiction your characters need a place to work and interact and creating your own city frees you up to add elements from several different areas or parts of the real world creating a fictional city will also allow you to use elements of a real city you know well such as your hometown and twist them around so they become fictional if you are very familiar and comfortable in a certain real life area you can then use what you know and change them slightly to create a fictional world creating a fictional city will also improve your writing overall as the more believable your city is in your book the more believable the world of your book will be to readers making a convincing fictional city will strengthen your characters as well as you can shape the city to fit with the actions and perspectives of your characters another option is to use a real city you know well such as your home city and add fictional elements to the city so it is not quite real the advantages of this are that you likely know your home city well and can use it as a template for fictional elements in the city you would like to explore you can also take physical landmarks or areas in your home city and change them based on your imagination this way the fictional city feels real to you in some way the name of the city is one of the most elements of a fictional city the name may be repeated often in your story by your main character other characters and in your descriptions you should think of a name that has resonance and feels purposeful you may choose a name that feels generic and sort of every small town if you want your story to have a more universal feel to it a name like milton or abbsortford for example does not tell readers too much about the town other than it is likely small and in north america avoid using a name like springfield as this immediately makes readers think of the simpsons which may not fit with your story consider a name that fits the region or area where your fictional city is located if your city is located in germany for example you may select a german name or a german term that could also function as a name if your city is located in canada you may select a canadian city that exists and change the name slightly to create a fictional name avoid names that seem obvious such as vengeance or hell as the reader will be alerted right away to the meaning behind the name the use of obvious names can be effective if the town acts in contrast to the name for example a town named hell that has the nicest most pleasant townspeople now that you have a name you are going to need to think about the history behind the city creating a historical record of the city will help the city to feel more believable to your characters and to your readers you should answer several key questions about your city including who founded the city this could be a lone explorer who stumbled on the land or native peoples who built up the city piece by piece using basic tools think about the individual or individuals responsible for founding the city when was the city founded this can help you get a better sense of the development of the city as a city founded 100 years ago will have a denser history than a city founded 15 years ago why was the city founded answering this question can help you better describe the city s past maybe the city was founded through colonization where a foreign explorer claimed the land and colonized it or maybe the city was founded by people who discovered empty land and built it up on their own the reasons for the city s existence will help you get a better sense of your characters as they may have personal ties and connections to the city due to how the city was founded and why it was founded how old is the city the age of the city is another important element an older city may have city planning details that have been preserved while a newer city may have very few old buildings and an experimental approach to city planning is the city nestled in the mountains surrounded by forest or is the city located in the desert surrounded by sand dunes your city may be more urban with a large population and a skyline of buildings and office towers or your city may more small town with a mid to small population and a few major streets focus on how a stranger to the town might view the city including the vegetation the terrain and the landscape you should also think about the climate of the city is it hot and humid or cold and dry the climate may also depend on the time of year when your story is taking place if your story takes place in the middle of winter in a fictional town located in northern california for example it may be warm during the day and cooler at night the demographics of the city means the type of individuals that make up the city in terms of race gender and class though your city may be fictional there will likely be variations in the demographics of the city you should include details about the demographics as this will make the city feel more believable consider the racial and ethnic groups in your city are there more african american individuals than latinos or caucasians do certain ethnic groups live in certain areas of the city are there areas where certain ethnic groups are not allowed or feel uncomfortable being in think about the class dynamics in your city this could mean a character who is middle class lives in a certain area of the city and a character of an upper class lives in a more lavish or expensive area of the city your fictional city may be divided by class with certain areas off limits to all classes except for one class it can be helpful to have a physical representation of the city even if you don t have the best drawing skills make a rough sketch of the city including major landmarks and the homes where your main characters live as well as where they work you may also notate landscape details like a mountain range that borders the city or sand dunes that protect the city from the outside try to add as many details as possible as this will help you build a more convincing fictional world if you have a friend who is talented at illustration you may ask them to help you draw a map of the city in more detail you can also use online resources to help you build the map use a program like photoshop for example to cut and paste images from the internet to create a map or a physical representation of the city now that you have the basics of the city down you can start to add some local color consider the unique or interesting elements of the city that makes it worth reading about this could be haunted areas of the city or famous ghost stories that haunt the city or this could be legends about the city that are shared and passed around by characters you should also think about what the town is known for according to the outside world maybe the city is known as the center of commerce or has one of the most renown sports teams consider what locals love or enjoy about the city as this will make it feel more unique what are the hotspots and cool hang out areas in the city what are the locals proud of in terms of their city and what are they ashamed of or afraid of in their city while it can be tempting to get very in depth and detailed about your fictional world it is also important that you focus on specific details that are an essential part of the overall story the city should serve your characters and your story not the other way around home in on certain areas in the city that are used by your characters and spend time developing these more fully for example maybe your character spends a lot of time at the private school located in the city center take the time to think about small details of the school from how the building appears within the surrounding area to the school colors and the school mascot focus on the area around the school and the layout of the school including classrooms and areas your character spends a lot of time in a big part of creating a believable world is making the reader feel like they are actually experiencing the city from the smell of the garbage to the noises on the street create descriptions that draw on sight taste smell touch and sound to help your city come alive for example maybe your city has a polluted river that runs through the area think of how it smells as you walk by the river have your characters comment on the stench of the river and the way the river looks or sounds your story will likely involve several locations or settings that recur focus on using the five senses to describe these recurring settings well as this will help the world of the story feel more convincing your reader will be aware she is reading fiction and will likely accept a lot of strange and imaginative elements of the city but it may be useful to also include elements of real life in the city this will help your reader feel more grounded in the city as your story moves along for example your characters may spend time in a dense urban area in the city the area may be populated with strange creatures and monsters but it may also have elements you may find in a real life urban area like buildings streets and alleyways having real life details and imagined details together can make it easier to build a believable world once you have a more detailed understanding of your fictional city it can be helpful to write your characters into the setting to see how they interact and move around the fictional city should support your overall story and your characters should be able to access elements of the city that are necessary to move the story forward for example if you have a character who needs to access a magical portal in the middle of the city to time travel you should make sure the magical portal is described well in the fictional city the magical portal should contain enough detail to be believable and your character should interact with it in an interesting way this will ensure your fictional city is supporting your character s needs and goals a big challenge when writing about a fictional city in a story is avoiding obvious moments of description where you put a description of the city in a character s voice to give the reader information about the setting this can feel like the writer is trying to talk through her characters in a way that may feel obvious and forced you can side step this issue by using the voices of your characters to inform the ways in which you describe the fictional city place your character in a situation where she has to walk around or interact with a certain section of the city or have your character use a facility in the city that then allows her to describe how it feels to use the facility this will give you the opportunity to have descriptions of the fictional city through the perspective of the character which will feel more believable and convincing to the reader than simply telling the reader about the facility you should also have your characters treat the more fantastical or strange elements of the fictional city casually and in a straightforward manner if your fictional city is located under water for example a character who has lived in the city for a long period of time may not be surprised that he has to get in his submarine to visit with his neighbor you can describe the character getting into the submarine and programming it for it s destination in a casual every day kind of way this will signal to the reader that submarines are common in this fictional city and used as a form of transportation without having to directly tell the reader that this is the case

your specifications planning at least 10 days in advance is a good idea some places do have kegs available for last minute orders but these may be limited in selection and size if you are planning to serve beer from a keg at a wedding fundraiser or other special event you need to get the correct type of permit these permits are typically issued by your state s liquor control board for private parties such as weddings or holiday parties apply for a banquet permit typically you will fill out a form giving information about the event and pay a fee around 50 nonprofit organizations need a special occasion permit in order to serve beer from a keg at a special event these are also issued by your state s liquor control board they also need a licensed bartender to serve the beer be sure to

other items are returned in the same condition as when you rented them some places might require that you provide the address where the keg is going to the approximate date and time of the beer s

are usually cheaper than microbrews with budweiser costing 100 for a full keg and other beers like dogfish head running about 225 for a full keg before you leave the store ask for instructions on how to use the keg you might be familiar but it s a good idea to make sure you re clear on how to attach the tap and get the best quality beer from the keg kegs that are full of beer are heavy a full keg weighs roughly 162 pounds use a dolly if possible and have a friend help you lift the keg in and out of your vehicle kegs are usually only delivered to licensed establishments not private residences a tap is needed to attach to the keg in order to dispense the beer if you don t already have a tap you ll need to rent one most places require a refundable tap rental fee around 50 and a nonrefundable tap cleaning fee around 10 15 many establishments have chilling buckets available for rental these are garbage can sized buckets that the keg will go into along with ice for keeping the keg cold a kegerator is a refrigerator that is specially designed to hold a keg and to allow for easy beer dispensing many places will rent kegerators by the day week month or even on a rent to own plan if you are hosting a special event or are planning to regularly have kegs a kegerator may be a classier more versatile option for you a jockey box is a mini cooler that has tubing through which beer will flow to a tap hook up your keg to the jockey box along with a carbon dioxide unit and this will produce instantly cold beer on tap for your guests jockey boxes can be rented with 1 2 or 4 taps in one unit the beer should be served at about 38 degrees fahrenheit but that requires that you keep the beer cold use a chilling bucket filled with ice or a kegerator a refrigerator specially designed for kegs alternately you can place the keg inside a large garbage bag and fill the bag with ice do not allow the beer to go above 55 degrees f or below 28 degrees f beer that is too warm will produce bacterial growth beer that has frozen will have reduced quality of flavor and aroma after the keg has arrived at your house you need to give it time to settle down so the beer is of optimal quality situate the keg in the desired location for your event and leave it there for at least an hour before tapping the keg depending on the type of tap you use on the keg you may need to finish the beer sooner than later a manual pump the kind most often used at a party for example will reduce the quality of the beer s taste rather quickly in this case drink the beer within 8 hours you may be able to stretch this out to one day using a kegerator and co2 to dispense your beer will prolong the quality and freshness of the beer in this case pasteurized beer can last up to 3 months unpasteurized beer might last about 2 months remove all the beer in the keg before you return it some places ask that the kegs be returned empty you are paying for the beer so you might as well drink it or store it in growlers large bottles for beer you will not get any refund on the keg once it leaves the store where you bought it even if the keg is entirely full you have purchased it and will receive no refund if you request one before you transport the keg in your vehicle make sure to remove the tap from the keg otherwise the keg could be considered an open container which is illegal to have in a moving vehicle in the u s when you rented the keg you should have given the establishment the name of the person returning the keg this will likely be the same person who rented the keg this person is the one who will receive the refundable deposit back the store might refuse to accept the keg and equipment if the wrong person tries to return them you don t have to bring the keg back the morning after a party but you do need to bring it back in a timely manner most places will give a deadline by which the keg needs to be returned sometimes this is 5 days while other places give you up to 2 weeks to return a keg if you rented a tap or a bucket for chilling the keg be sure to return these with the keg then you will receive any refundable fees associated with the keg and accessories the store where you picked up the keg will place an identifying sticker on the keg they will need this information to make sure the returned keg is the one that was rented there are strict laws governing the sale of alcohol in the u s and some states regulate the sale and storage of beer in kegs there are some restrictions on keg size and type so be informed about what your state allows check with your state s liquor control board to find out specifics regarding liquor regulations in your area kegs can be filled through valves that are either located on the side open system which can be easily accessed and filled or through a closed system valve that requires automated equipment for filling closed system kegs are typically more expensive but they are usually preferred by distributors and breweries that might carry your beer keg sizes are varied and the most common sizes are sixth barrel quarter barrel and half barrel consider who you are selling your beer to and how frequently when deciding on keg size and number will the brewery or distributor ask for smaller sized kegs to start or on the other hand should you start with larger kegs so that your customers don t have to change their kegs so often knowing your market will go a long way to knowing what size and number of kegs to buy you can find new and used kegs and used kegs are certainly a cheaper option new kegs look better and can be imprinted with your company s logo while used kegs may have the former owner s logo on them new kegs are usually more easily sanitized while older kegs can potentially have build up called beerstone if you are buying a used keg make sure to consider the following make sure the keg does not leak make sure the keg is sanitized and able to be cleaned make sure the keg is not dented verify that the keg will hold the correct amount of beer and any dents do not subtract from the correct amount you don t have to buy a keg for your business there are leasing companies that charge a monthly fee per keg many of these companies have multi year contracts such as 5 year contracts a typical rate is 1 70 per keg per month kegs can be filled through valves that are either located on the side open system which can be easily accessed and filled or through a closed system valve that requires automated equipment for filling closed system kegs are typically more expensive and will likely require additional equipment that can run from hundreds of dollars to thousands of dollars keg sizes are varied and the most common sizes are sixth barrel quarter barrel and half barrel consider how much beer you will be brewing and how quickly it will be consumed when deciding on keg size and number the most common keg for the home brewer is the cornelius keg also called a corny keg these are the same

query	160	buy a private island the process of buying a private island is similar to the process of buying any other kind of real estate but there are a lot of additional considerations to take into account such as accessibility and basic utilities depending on the size location and amenities you are looking for you could spend many millions of dollars on your private island or less than 100 000 1 no matter what kind of island you are thinking about buying be sure to do your research so you understand exactly what you are getting yourself into deciding what kind of island is right for you thinking about practicalities conducting the transaction think about your needs choose a location set a budget decide if you will rent out your island consider basic infrastructure consider accessibility analyze the existing infrastructure investigate environmental restrictions find out what permits you will need decide if you will need a caretaker find a trusted broker get a lawyer to help guide you start searching for an island evaluate the asking price make an offer before you start looking for your ideal island it s a good idea to have at least a general idea of what it is you re looking for consider making a list of all of the features you absolutely need and a separate list of features you would like but are willing to compromise on think about how large of an island you need if you just want a simple cottage and a private beach you may be comfortable with a few acres but if you are planning to develop a resort you will need a much larger island think about what kind of buildings you need if the buildings do not already exist on the property be sure to look into building regulations before you purchase the island think about the kind of landscape you are looking for some islands may have white sandy beaches while others may have cliffs and dense jungles it s also important to think about the type of beaches the island has to offer for example you may prefer sandy beaches to rocky beaches or you may prefer a beach that faces the west if you want to watch the sun set you may also want to think about whether the water immediately surrounding the island is good for recreational hobbies that you enjoy like scuba diving or fishing location is probably the most crucial factor you will need to consider when buying a private island be sure to do plenty of research and choose a location that truly meets all of your needs climate is a huge consideration so make sure you understand what the weather is like year round find out if the area is prone to extreme weather like monsoons or hurricanes determine how far away from civilization you really want to be keeping in mind that being completely isolated may make it difficult to get supplies and get help in the case of an emergency also think about the towns or cities that are closest to your island if you think you might need or want to leave the isolation of your island from time to time it s best if you enjoy the cultural amenities that the local area has to offer think carefully about how much you can reasonably afford to spend on your own private island and do your best to stick to your budget if you can t afford what you really want just yet consider waiting until you can rather than settling for a less expensive island that doesn t meet your needs when deciding on a budget keep in mind that you might have a very hard time getting financing for a private island banks are often wary about lending money for these purchases because islands are extremely difficult to appraise if you choose an island that is close to a well developed area you will have more luck getting financing than if you choose a remote island if you plan on building on your island it s a good idea to start working with an architect and contractor right away so you have a good understanding of what the costs will be building on remote islands is much more expensive than building in a developed area because it s difficult to get all of the materials to your build site when setting your budget be sure to consider the costs of traveling to and from your island maintaining your island and making any necessary improvements you may just be looking for your own personal escape but if you are thinking about renting your island out to guests you may have a great way of earning extra income if this is your plan there are some additional considerations to take into account so be sure to do your research and ensure that the island you are looking at will indeed work as a rental property work with your lawyer to ensure that you will be legally permitted to rent out your island for short periods of time think about how guests will get to your island if it is very remote you may need to offer to arrange for transportation consider what kind of services you will need to offer for your guests for example if the island is remote you will probably have to offer a cook to prepare meals you may also want to offer recreational activities if you re looking at undeveloped islands they will most likely not have any utilities when developing your island you will need to invest in systems that allow you to bring the comforts of modern living to a remote area which can be very expensive if the island doesn t have electricity you will need to invest in a solar system and maybe a backup generator if the island doesn t have a source of fresh water you will probably need a special purification system to make seawater or rainwater potable these systems can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars so be sure to do your research before you finalize your purchase creature comforts like cable and cell reception may be very hard to come by if you are far from civilization when choosing the perfect island it s important to consider how you will get there consider whether you will need to take a commercial flight to get near your island or if you can drive once you are in the general vicinity of your island think about whether you will be able to take your own boat to the island or if you will need to charter a plane think carefully about how much it will cost to get from your primary residence to your island and back if it is too expensive you may not end up spending as much time there as you would have liked be sure to consider how long you will be able to spend on your island during each visit as well if you want to go for the weekend it s best to choose an island closer to home but if you plan on spending months at a time on your island a 14 hour flight might be no big deal remember that water depth is very important if the water around the island is too shallow you may not be able to get there in certain vessels unless you dredge the area or build a large dock it s important to see the island at high and low tides so you understand the true accessibility if you are buying an island with existing infrastructure it s important to have a thorough inspection to make sure everything is in good working order it s always best to have a good idea of what repairs will be needed before you purchase any property in addition to assessing the structures your inspector should take a close look at the existing utilities repairs to these systems can be extremely expensive it s also a good idea to confirm that the buildings have all necessary government permits some islands have very delicate ecosystems that can be disturbed by construction for this reason there may be some restrictions on what you are allowed to build and where to be safe it is a good idea to have the seller obtain the necessary governmental approvals for the kind of development you are interested in you should also consider hiring a professional to conduct and environmental impact study some islands may have protected areas if for example endangered species inhabit the area this would prevent you from building any structures on that part of the island be sure to consider non legal restrictions as well for example you should find out how high the water has been known to rise in order to avoid building your house in an area that is likely to flood depending on what you plan on doing with your island and where it is located you may need to obtain permits from the government it is a good idea to find out about what permits are required and what the process is for applying before you purchase the island you may need a building permit if you want to construct a new building on the island or modify an existing building there may be certain restrictions regarding the size of the buildings you are allowed to construct or the manner in which they must be constructed you may need additional permits or licenses if you plan on running any kind of business from your island depending on the location of your island and the amount of maintenance it requires you may need to hire a caretaker to look after it when you are not there since an island is isolated it is hard to protect against unwanted visitors and squatters without one a caretaker can also look after buildings and equipment making sure they re all in good order and condition in order to start shopping for a private island you will need to work with a real estate broker choose a broker who has a lot of experience in buying and selling private islands as these properties pose unique challenges to buyers if you don t know of any brokers you can search for one and read reviews online you can search listings for private islands online just like you can for other types of real estate but not everything is listed online your broker will have access to all of the listings both public and private if you are thinking about buying a private island outside of your country of residence it s a good idea to consult with an experienced attorney laws regarding property ownership and residency vary dramatically from country to country in some countries non citizens are not permitted to buy land outright but are permitted to purchase long term leaseholds for periods of up to 99 years some islands may also have strict environmental codes that restrict you from developing on them you will probably need to devote a lot of time to viewing different properties when you are shopping for an island your broker will take you to see islands that meet your criteria and you will need to choose the one that works best for you don t be too surprised if you are unable to fly to a property when you planned to due to bad weather these kinds of delays are par for the course when you re dealing with remote islands consider bringing along a trusted friend or relative to help you evaluate your options never buy an island without seeing it first there are all sorts of surprises that may not be evident in the listing pictures it can be tricky to determine whether the price of an island is fair or not because not many are bought and sold so you may not have much to compare the price to work with your broker to evaluate comparable properties as much as possible at the end of the day it s most important that the island is worth the price to you so don t pay more than you are comfortable with try not to get too emotional about this decision if the island is over your budget or doesn t have the features you are looking for keep looking once you find the island of your dreams it s time to make an offer the exact process for conducting a real estate transaction will depend on the island s location but your broker will guide you through the process if you think the island is over priced you can offer a lesser amount the seller has the option to accept your offer decline it or counter your offer with a new one 
query	161	kill lake weeds while there are many benefits to lake weeds and algae extreme proliferation can cause many problems when lake weeds cover more than 25 of the lake surface it is considered dense growth 1 this can interfere with water recreation such as boating and swimming it can also interfere with fishing by producing a foul taste and smell in the water most importantly dense lake weed growth can cause major fish kills by depleting oxygen in the water at night 2 make sure to take the proper control measures in your lake or pond to ensure a safe and flourishing aquatic environment remember aquatic vegetation is an important part of the ecosystem if algae and underwater vegetation have taken over your pond or lake use controls to restore balance without removing all of your vegetation taking preventative measures implementing manual controls utilizing proper chemical methods using biological controls design your lake properly keep your lake deep create a buffer zone around your lake be proactive use a benthic barrier remove weeds by hand use weed removal devices dredge and deepen the lake choose the correct herbicide apply under the proper conditions dose properly reapply as needed check your local laws introduce swans to the lake release grass carp into the lake research which insects may be helpful many species of lake weeds flourish when they can take root in underlying soil you can prevent this by creating steep banks on the edge of your lake or pond that descend directly into deep waters consider constructing lake banks with a 3 1 grade that descend into a water depth of 5ft this strategy will prevent submersed plants from rooting in the lake but it will not help with algae or free floating plants make sure that your lake maintains a depth of 2 3ft at its most shallow point this will help prevent weeds from taking root if they continue to proliferate throughout your lake or pond keep in mind that this will only work for rooted weeds not algae or free floating plants lake weed proliferation is usually caused by an overabundance of nutrients in the surrounding soil the runoff from fertilizer in the soil feeds these lake weeds and causes them to grow in large numbers create a riparian buffer zone by planting 100ft of natural plants or trees between your fertilized land and your lake to prevent runoff from entering the lake choose plants that will prevent erosion and that do not require any chemicals to be applied if you have livestock nutrients from their feed and animal waste may also enter runoff and cause weed proliferation consider building a fence around your livestock or keep them at least 100ft away from the lake s edge once you notice a significant lake weed issue be sure to address it as soon as possible continual overgrowth will lead to more serious weed problems the more you allow the weeds to grow the more expensive and time consuming it will be to address the problem at a later date if you notice too many ducks or feeding fish around your lake you may want to take steps to reduce their presence their waste can contribute to the growth of weeds a benthic barrier is a sheet that lays on the bottom of the lake preventing sun from reaching the lake bottom so it kills lake weeds it targets this is a non chemical reusable product that is safe for fish some vegetative growth is necessary for the health of the lake if you use a benthic barrier leave some area uncovered to allow for natural vegetative growth don t cover fish spawning or bird nesting areas you can easily cut up lake weeds from the roots collect the cut weeds and remove them from your lake or pond they can be cut with a sickle or pulled up by hand then removed from the water with rakes or hoes most lake weeds are perennials meaning they will continue to sprout throughout the season due to underwater roots you must remove them from their underlying roots in order to be properly control them depending on the size of your lake or pond and the weeds you are trying to remove you may need an underwater or motor driven device controlling lake weeds by hand can be labor intensive and difficult as these weeds usually grow back quickly motor driven underwater removal devices can help cut lake weeds loose under water like water lilies and water milfoil there are also aquatic weed harvesters that collect weeds for removal motor driven devices often leave cut up weed fragments in the water new weeds may grow from these pieces so be careful when removing weeds this way for surface algae in smaller bodies of water water pumps can circulate the top layer of water to prevent algal scum from settling mechanical control of lake weeds can be likened to mowing a lawn these devices will trim the weeds but it is a temporary solution if the weed problem is severe and weeds cover over 25 of the lake surface consider dredging and deepening the lake this will remove existing weeds and the bottom layer of sediment as well as any underlying nutrients that cause weed proliferation dredging and deepening will reveal a layer of nutrient poor soil limit the amount of sunlight weeds are exposed to and make it more difficult for weeds to take root it is necessary to properly identify the weed before purchasing herbicide different species and types require different herbicides if you are unsure of the weed call your county extension office or an herbicide dealer to make sure you buy the effective herbicide make sure you understand the effects and implications of applying an herbicide before doing so read the label on your herbicide to understand the restrictions and wait time on boating swimming and fishing before applying this may be an important factor when choosing an herbicide herbicide comes in both liquid and solid form as sprays or granules for algal weed control consider using copper sulfates or copper chelates such as cutrine plus these can be applied directly to the infested area as per the instructions on the label for certain submersed plants such as pond weeds and free floating plants such as duckweed consider using a diquat or fluridone rooted floating plants such as water lilies and emergent plants such as cattails are best treated with glyphosate check your local and state regulations before using herbicides in a body of water permits are required for some types of applications herbicides are best applied in late spring when plants are youngest and weakest if you wait until late summer when vegetation is thick you risk major fish kills by depleting oxygen all at once apply when water temperatures are in the upper 60s fahrenheit herbicides do not work effectively when the water is too cold make sure that you are using the proper dose when applying herbicide the herbicide label will describe how to calculate dosage dosage is usually measured based on acre feet which can be determined by multiplying the surface area acreage by the average depth the label will then tell you how much to apply based on this measurement never apply a larger dose than listed on the label herbicides will need to be reapplied in subsequent years to come underlying seeds are unaffected by herbicides and will therefore emerge the next year despite initial treatment make sure to continue to apply in the spring to treat any structures that lay dormant in the winter depending on the type of biological control that you use you may need to get a permit from your local department of wildlife or agriculture some species that can control lake weeds are considered invasive in particular areas and you may not be allowed to introduce them always learn what your local laws are before introducing a new animal or fish into your lake mute swans can be released onto small lakes as they feed on both submerged plants and algae they may be ideal to control vegetation keep in mind that swans require extra care husbandry and protection from predators also known as the white amur grass carp feed on the submersed plants in your lake they are usually introduced into a lake to control vegetation keep in mind that grass carp will eat almost any submerged vegetation not just invasive species or weeds grass carp will not help much with duckweed or watermeal it is recommended that you stock 15 to 30 fish per acre of lake get carp that are at least ten or twelve inches long grass carp can be invasive check your local laws to make sure that you are allowed to use them as a biological control before you release them into your lake if you want to target a specific weed you may look into using insects as form of biological control you will need to find insects that are host specific this means you pick a species of insects that will only eat the specific weed that you want to remove you can research your particular weed to see if there is an insect species that may help you might also reach out to your local department of wildlife or agriculture noxious weed control board or an ecologist do not release non native insects until you have verified that they will only eat the plant in question and that they will have no other impact on your local ecosystem

query	164	buy your way onto a mount everest expedition mount everest in the himalayas on the border of nepal and china is the highest mountain above sea level climbing mount everest represents the ultimate challenge for a climber and was once scaled only by the most expert mountaineers today however if you know how to buy your way onto a mount everest expedition it is possible for a less experienced climber to scale the mountain with the help of experienced mountain guides and sherpas before you can arrange a mount everest ascent you will need to prepare mentally and physically for this major undertaking plan the expedition with the help of a mountain climbing company and pay for the costs of the expedition comparing expedition companies and booking the expedition preparing mentally and physically for the expedition contact experienced mountain climbing companies who have a strong track record on everest discuss the supplies and services covered for the expedition determine your budget for the expedition compare the prices and services provided by several climbing companies pay for the expedition and set your expedition date follow a strict training program six months before your expedition date focus on building cardiovascular strength and endurance build muscle mass through free weights and interval training do several big climbs before you commit to everest enroll in an everest training camp get the necessary gear for the climb you will be spending lots of money and lots of time on the expedition up to 60 days in nepal total from arrival to the climb and then the return home so you should try to find an experienced mountain climbing company who have a high track record of successful climbs call several mountain climbing companies who specialize in everest climbs and ask them how their season went look for companies that have a high success rate of climbers who made the summit and over 80 of climbers reaching the summit if not scaling it completely recent expeditions to everest have not occurred or been postponed due to natural disasters and poor weather you should confirm the companies have expeditions for the year you would like to book and the time frame most companies arrange expeditions between april and may when the wind is less severe on the mountain usually the more services and one on one guidance you would like the more expensive the expedition will be most companies will provide mountain professional guides expedition permits accommodation in the kathmandu all transportation to nepal yaks porters and guides to and from base camp tents showers and toilet tents weather reports and oxygen for the altitude change on the mountain however not all companies provide one on one guides throughout the trip ask the company how many sherpas and guides they provide for each climb some companies provide one guide and one sherpa per a climber and other companies may offer one sherpa and one guide per two climbers the cost of hiring a mountain climbing guide for everest can vary depending on your budget the total cost of climbing everest can run into the tens of thousands around 70 000 when you factor in the climbing permit the gear the airline tickets to nepal and the mountain guide fee you should determine how much you are willing to spend on the expedition before you start to compare the prices of different guiding companies as you may be able to find a guiding company that still offers you what you require but does not break your budget before you hire a climbing company for the everest expedition you should compare rates and services between several companies if you are looking for one on one guides you may end up paying more for this service through a specific company however if you are looking for a less guided experience you may pay less through another company keep in mind everest can be a fatal situation if you do not have the right training the right gear and a good guide avoid cheaping out on guiding services if it means you may be risking your life as it will be worth it if you can make it to the summit alive and well once you have chosen the mountain guiding company for you you should pay for the expedition and book your spot determine your expedition date and book your flights to nepal then focus on training properly at least six months before your expedition date so you are prepared and ready to take on everest climbing everest is a serious endeavor that requires peak physical and mental fitness when you are on your expedition you will need to be able to hike steep outdoor trails with a pack that can weigh 22 30 kilograms for two to three hour periods you will also need to be comfortable hiking in thick winter gear and heavy boots to prepare for the expedition you should commit to a strict training program at least six months before your expedition date so you are physically and mentally prepared for the climb begin your training program by starting out with a moderate level of exercise four to five times a week you can then progress over the period of six months until you are at peak fitness the idea is to work your way up to peak fitness and not overwork or over stress your body it is essential that you do cardiovascular training and conditioning at least one year to six months before your planned expedition to build up strength and endurance start your training by committing to a regular workout routine where you are training at least four to five times a week you should get to the point where you can do your workout and not ache the next day you should do some form of cardiovascular activity for at least 45 60 minutes four to five times a week biking running swimming and using the steppe machine at the gym are all good options rest for one to two days or do a fun physical activity on one of your rest days like climbing skiing or skating enlist the support of friends and do cardio activities together you should aim to get your heart rate to between thirty and forty beats faster per minute over a thirty minute workout also known as conversation pace where you can talk to someone comfortably during the workout as the months go on you should try to improve your heart rate increasing the duration of your cardio activities you can do free weight exercises and follow an interval training program at home using free weights and an exercise mat start with free weight training three times a week and then work your way to four to five times a week you should combine free weight training with cardio training to get the most out of your workouts a typical workout week could look like monday cardio activity for thirty minutes running biking rowing strength training with sit ups pull ups 15 reps three sets and push ups 40 reps three sets you can also incorporate weight training with free weights such as bicep curls and military presses tuesday different cardio activity for thirty minutes running biking rowing or longer no strength workout wednesday strength workout incorporating sit ups pull ups push ups and free weights do more exercises than you did on monday rest from cardio activity thursday cardio activity for thirty minutes running biking rowing or longer you can also go for an hour long hike or run on a trail outdoors instead no strength workout friday cardio activity for thirty minutes or longer repeat monday s strength workout saturday rest day or a fun recreational cardio activity like a hike or a climb sunday rest day no activity always stretch before you do any exercise and drink lots of water before and after your workouts about three to four quarts a day hydration is important for dealing with altitude affects when you are on everest it is recommended that you try to do at least one to two big climbs on mountains before you commit to climbing everest many people who climb everest will work their way up to bigger peaks over a period of one to two years before they commit to everest having experience climbing high peaks will also allow you to develop the mental strength needed on a climb as you may be faced with physical exhaustion and need to stay strong mentally to continue to climb you should ask climbing friends for recommendations on big climbs you can do to prepare for the high altitude environment of everest or talk to the mountain climbing company about climbs that may be useful as preparation for everest if the notion of training for everest on your own seems too daunting you can enroll in a training camp that focuses on preparing you mentally and physically for the expedition some of these training camps can be done through the mountain climbing company that you hire to take you on the mt everest expedition ask the companies for rates on training programs and what will be covered in their training programs most training camps can be done at a mountain climbing company in your area these programs may simulate the experience of climbing everest indoors or take you on climbs that are similar to everest to prepare you for the expedition most climbing companies will expect climbers to have their own climbing gear and their own climbing packs you should have enough supplies for two months on the mountain with the goal of packing smart rather than packing light the climbing companies may be able to provide a list of necessary gear and supplies for the climb you should have plastic frost proof clubbing bootstwo sets of thermal base layersdown parka with a hood and down pantsat least six pairs of warm

that is near to but not the same as the north pole 1 in casual everyday situations this minor difference is often ignored but if you re seriously attempting to navigate in the wilderness it can present problems fortunately there are a variety of ways to find true north the direction that points toward the north pole using everything from a modern computer to nothing more than the sun moon and stars adjusting a compass for declination finding true north without a compass in the northern hemisphere in the southern hemisphere find your local declination from the ngdc alternatively find your declination from a map find magnetic north with your compass turn the orienting arrow so it points ahead of you adjust for declination use the motion of the sun use an analog watch look for clues in nature use polaris the north star use the moon use the southern cross at night one of the things that can make the difference between true north and magnetic north so difficult for navigators is that the effect on compasses can change over time this phenomenon is called declination as the earth s magnetic field fluctuates the number of degrees by which a compass will be off from true north will shift accordingly thus to accurately adjust your compass to account for this effect you ll need a recent declination value for your location luckily the national geophysical data center ngdc keeps up to date records of global declination values at the ngdc website you can enter your current location to receive the most recent declination value available for your area some physical maps will also include declination values for the area displayed in the map topographical maps are the most likely to include this information though it can be in other types of maps as well if you re considering navigating by map and compass consider checking your map s legend to see whether the map contains accurate declination data note of course that declination changes over time so old maps can quickly become out of date for the most accurate values use the most recently published map available once you know how off your compass is from true north it s not hard to adjust for this discrepancy begin by finding magnetic north hold your compass flat and level in front of you if your compass has a travel arrow usually a skinny red arrow on the flat lower portion of the compass point this forward watch the motion of the compass needle when the needle stops moving note the direction the needle points this will be the north south axis most modern compasses have a needle that is half red and half white in this case the red end of the needle is the north pointing end if you re navigating by compass typically at this point you would adjust the compass s bezel to that the direction you re intending to travel is directly in front of you aligned with the travel arrow in this case since we want to find north we ll turn the bezel so that the n and the wide arrow beneath it is directly in front of us note that this magnetic north not true north we still need to adjust for declination turn your body until the compass s needle is lined up with the orienting arrow on the bezel and thus the travel arrow as well you are now facing toward magnetic north to find true north turn the bezel the same magnitude and direction as your declination value most compasses will have degree markers on the bezel to help you do this next line up your needle and your orienting arrow by turning your body again you should now be facing true north for example let s say that we originally obtained a declination value of 14o e for the area we re in if we re facing towards magnetic north we would turn our bezel 14o to the east clockwise in this case then we would turn to the left which is west to line up the needle with the orienting arrow leaving us facing at true north 14o west of magnetic north if you don t have a compass don t worry it s still possible to find true north by using natural clues for instance because the sun rises in the east and sets in the west it s possible to use this information to get a rough sense for the direction of north just after sunrise keep the sun on your right to face north just before sunset keep the sun on your left at noon the sun will be directly south so face away from it to find north one way to get a north reading that s a little more accurate is to use a stick as a sort of sundial plant a stick or pole that s a few feet high in the ground and mark the tip of its shadow on the ground wait about 15 minutes then mark its new location stand with your left foot on the first mark and your right foot on the second you will be facing more or less towards true north regardless of the declination where you are one handy trick for finding true north involves using the hands of a non digital watch to start remove your watch and hold it in your hand with the hour hand facing forward turn your body so that the hour hand points toward the sun find the midway point between your hour hand and the 12 o clock mark at the top of the watch this will point along the north south axis for instance let s say it s 4 00 pm the midpoint between 4 00 and 12 00 is 2 00 so if we point the hour hand toward the sun the north south axis will be a little less than a quarter turn to our left since it s in the afternoon and the sun is setting in the west we can infer that north will be behind us if we face toward the 2 00 marker don t forget to compensate for daylight savings time if your watch is adjusted for dst use the 1 00 marking rather than the 12 00 marking and proceed as normal certain natural organisms especially plants and trees can give clues about which direction is north to be clear however these rules are very loose and will not always work so most of the time other methods are preferable before are a few examples of what to look for moss may be thicker on the south sides of trees due to more sunlight trees bark may be duller colored and branches may stretch higher toward the sky on the north side due to less sunlight ants ant hills may tend to be on the southern side of natural features where the sun is warmer snow snow may melt faster on the southern side of trees and rocks where it receives more sunlight it s surprisingly easy to find north at night if you know what you re looking for polaris also called the north star is almost perfectly aligned with the earth s north pole so if you can find it you ll know exactly where true north is there are several ways to find polaris but the easiest way is usually to use the big dipper the two stars at the end of the spoon portion of the constellation point directly to polaris unfortunately polaris can t be seen from the southern hemisphere so it s only useful for navigation north of the equator like the sun the moon moves across the sky in an east west direction this means that you can use the position of the moon to help orient yourself toward true north at night early in the night keep the moon on your right to face north late in the night keep it on your left when the moon is at its highest point in the sky it s roughly due south so face away from it to find north if the moon is a crescent you can also mentally draw a line through the horns of its crescent to the horizon to find south then face away from this to find north this works best when the moon is high in the sky because the light from the sun moon and stars hit the southern hemisphere at a different angle than they hit the northern hemisphere the process of finding north is a little different south of the equator for instance while the sun still rises in the east and sets in the west in the southern hemisphere at noon it is due north rather than due south this means that while you ll still want to keep the sun on your right just after sunrise and on your left just after sunset to face north you ll want to face towards it to find north at noon because the sun sweeps out a northern arc rather than a southern one in the southern hemisphere the directions for finding north with a watch are essentially reversed point the 12 00 mark on your watch toward the sun then find the line that marks the halfway point between the 12 00 mark and your hour hand this represents the north south axis for instance if it s 6 00 pm we would get a north south axis running through the 3 00 and 9 00 markings on our watch since it s the evening we know that the sun is in the western half of the sky thus when we point the 12 00 marking at the sun the 3 00 will point roughly towards true north the southern hemisphere doesn t have a convenient pole star like polaris to make navigation easy the closest equivalent is a constellation called the southern cross that rotates tightly around the south celestial pole to estimate due south find the southern cross and draw a line directly down to the horizon this will be approximately due south so face away from this to find due north the easiest way to find the southern cross is to use the pointers two bright stars in the southern sky that point directly at it the pointers can be found in the white splotchy streak that is the milky way which is often visible in locations with little or no light pollution in the southern hemisphere the moon still travels from east to west just like the sun however at its highest point in the sky it faces due north not due south this means that the directions for navigating with a crescent moon are reversed the line extending through the horns of the crescent to the horizon will point roughly to the north rather than to the south

query	168	take photos of mountains mountains are beautiful for landscape photos to photograph mountain use the best equipment to get the job done experiment taking photos through different lenses to give yourself options to choose from make sure to plan ahead and shoot during hours when the lighting is best experiment shooting from different angles and include interesting landmarks and people to make your photos unique using equipment effectively shooting at the right time getting the right lighting making your photos unique use a small aperture avoid wide shots take the same pictures with different lenses bring a tripod plan ahead aim for the golden hour do not hesitate to shoot on cloudy days avoid windy days go for colorful lights at sunrise and sunset search for side lighting emphasize shape and form with back lighting avoid midday photographs opt for unusual mountains shoot photos from a lower angle add people to give a sense of size the aperture is the opening through which light enters your camera lens most cameras allow you to adjust your aperture in the settings for photographing mountains opt for a smaller aperture setting this helps both mountain peaks and foregrounds to stay in focus aim for an aperture setting between f 11 and f 16 every camera is different consult your instructions manual to figure out how to change the settings on your camera many people s instinct is to use the widest lens possible when shooting mountains however this is not necessary a very wide lens avoids focusing on one mountain which can fail to capture a mountain s size this can also magnify the foreground over the mountain itself go for narrower lenses when shooting mountains you can always experiment if you re curious to see what a wide shot would look like use a wider lens and then take a few shots with a narrower lens adjust your camera s polarizer between shots play around and experiment a little opting to shoot the same scene through different lenses this way at the end of the day you will have multiple pictures to choose from if you know photoshop it s easy to blend two exposures together to get the image you want a small lightweight tripod is necessary for the best mountain shots you do not have to use it for every shot you take but it can help steady the camera bring a tripod with you on a hike if you re going to be shooting mountains make sure the tripod is adjustable so you can shoot mountains from different angles before setting out to shoot mountains do some basic planning check the weather forecast for that day to anticipate any conditions like overcast skies that can affect lighting you should also look up how long a certain hike takes if you want to shoot a particular mountain at sunset for example see how long it will take you to reach that mountain this way you can time your hike accordingly just before sunrise and sunset are known as the golden hours for mountain photography they tend to provide the best light as well as interesting colors and textures try to hit one of the golden hours when going out to photograph mountains you can check online to see when the sun rises and sets in a given area try to be around the mountains during these times keep in mind tall mountain peaks sometimes block out sunrises and sunsets try talking to other photographers about the ranges you re photography and ask them about the best peaks to shoot during golden hour cloudy days do not mean you have to quit and go home clouds can add an interesting background they can also provide a foreground when reflected through water experiment when you see clouds by taking some photographs that include them you may find you like what you see the one weather condition to avoid is wind very windy days will affect your ability to shoot lakes often found in front of mountains you will not be able to get any reflection unless the water is still in general opt out of shooting on windy days if you re able to hit a mountain during a sunrise or sunset you can get an array of colors this way sunrises and sunsets provides colors in the sky which may be reflected in bodies of water or the mountains themselves for the most colorful imagery seek out light provide just before morning and just before nightfall when hiking during the day stop and notice the sun turn 90 degrees from wherever the sun is in the sky the scene you see will be lighted by what is called side lighting shoot whatever scene is here side lighting generally solid and crisp lighting for mountain photographs experiment with different filters and lenses when shooting scenes using side lighting you may not get the exact shot you wanted relying on side lighting but you may be surprised by some of the stunning images you find if you re looking to convey the shape and form of mountains opt for back lighting back lighting is provided when the sun is directly behind the mountains this generally emphasizes the mountains themselves rather than the color of the scene often you end up with a silhouette when leaning on backlighting if you want to shoot with backlighting aim to be in the mountains just before morning or just before sunset midday photographs provide overwhelming light as the mountains will be front lit the color is generally neutral and the texture is not as intricate spend the midday hiking to the peaks you want to shoot around nightfall rather than taking pictures do not take the same pictures everyone takes lots of people shoot big landscapes or popular peaks in a particular range try to look for unique imagery for example focus your photo on something interesting in the foreground like a plant and use that to demonstrate the size of the mountain before going to a mountain range look for amateur photos taken of the range online you can find these on places like flickr and instagram these will allow you to see what peaks ranges and angles have already been extensively photographed a lower angle can make for an interesting perspective lower yourself and your tripod to the ground and angle the camera upward to capture a mountain this can also help you find interesting foregrounds or frames for your photo for example you can shoot a mountain range through blades of grass if you re hiking with others include them in your photographs this can show those viewing your photos how big the mountains are try for example photographing a few hikers as they approach a large mountain

query	172	treat tachycardia tachycardia is a potentially dangerous medical condition during which your heart rate speeds up past 100 beats per minute while at rest 1 tachycardia can involve the heart s upper chambers atrial lower chambers ventricular or both a tachycardia episode may be a one off event and cause no symptoms or complications but if it happens frequently then it may be a sign of a systemic disease or abnormal heart function chronic tachycardia increases your risk of heart attack and stroke home remedies and strategies can help lower your heart rate when you occasionally have a racing heart although chronic tachycardia often requires medication treating tachycardia at home getting medical attention for tachycardia stop and rest for a few minutes try some relaxation techniques use a vagal maneuver avoid substances and habits that can trigger tachycardia ask your doctor about the cause of your tachycardia ask your doctor about medication side effects and interactions control high blood pressure and cholesterol levels talk to your doctor about anti arrhythmic medication consider catheter ablation if appropriate think about a surgical procedure if recommended most people experience short episodes of tachycardia on rare occasions due to high levels of stress a sudden fright or an anxiety attack if this sounds like the cause of your racing heart then stop what you re doing and rest for five to 10 minutes maybe that means turning off a scary movie or removing yourself from a stressful situation argument or taking your mind off of a financial problem resting relaxing and taking deep breaths can naturally lower your heart rate normal resting heart rate can vary quite a bit amongst people but it s defined as between 60 and 100 beats per minute greater than 100 beats while at rest is the threshold for defining tachycardia tachycardia doesn t always cause symptoms but when it does the main one is feeling a racing heart or palpitations in your chest other symptoms are possible and can include shortness of breath lightheadedness dizziness fainting and chest pain since stress and anxiety are relatively common triggers for tachycardia and hyperventilation you can help prevent them by managing how you react or respond to stressful situations stress relieving techniques like yoga tai chi deep breathing visualization and meditation are all helpful for promoting relaxation and better emotional health ask at your local gym community center or health clinic about joining a stress relieving class try to limit the stress in your life by making positive changes get out of an abusive relationship change your job spend less time with negative people control anxious thoughts about your work finances and relationships excessive stress and anxiety causes the release of hormones that prepare your body for fight or flight which leads to increased heart and breathing rates don t forget to get enough quality sleep at least eight hours per night although some people need up to 11 hours for best health a chronic lack of sleep can lead to anxiety and heart palpitations vagal maneuvers are simple actions that you can do with your body that affect the vagus nerve which is the main one regulating your heartbeat maneuvers that affect the vagus nerve include doing the valsalva technique triggering the diving reflex and repeatedly coughing these simple maneuvers should be done as soon as you realize you re experiencing an episode of tachycardia they can slow your heart rate down within seconds if done correctly ask your doctor for a demonstration of these maneuvers the valsalva maneuver involves holding your breath and bearing down as if you re having a bowel movement for about 10 15 seconds it s a simple procedure but it can change the rhythm of electrical impulses in your heart and help your heart rate return to normal all people have a diving reflex which gets activated when plunged into cold water the body automatically slows its heart rate down to reduce blood flow in an attempt to preserve itself to trigger this reflex put very cold water or an ice pack against your face for at least 30 seconds you can also try coughing forcefully there are a number of substances that can trigger tachycardia including alcohol caffeine nicotine some illicit drugs such as cocaine and some over the counter medications particularly cold and cough medicines therefore if you re having periodic heart palpitations and feel that your heart is racing you should stop smoking as well as cut back on alcohol and caffeine rich beverages caffeine is found in coffee black and green teas most soda pop particularly colas energy drinks and chocolate caffeine doesn t give you energy it stimulates brain activity and increases heart rate and blood pressure consuming nicotine from cigarette smoking can increase your resting heart rate up to 15 beats min and increase blood pressure up to 10 mm hg binge drinking alcohol like on the weekends for example often increases heart rate whereas chronic alcoholism tends to cause fluctuations from too high to too low tachycardia is more common in anxious young people especially among females who drink lots of coffee alcohol and smoke heavily there are three types of tachycardia atrial or supraventricular tachycardia svt sinus tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia they are caused by different things and discovering which type of tachycardia you are suffering from will help your doctor decide on the appropriate treatment atrial or supraventricular tachycardia svt begins in the upper chambers of the heart it is the most common type of tachycardia found in children and may be caused by anxiety fatigue smoking drinking alcohol or caffeine sinus tachycardia may be caused by a fever anxiety medication or recreational drugs fright strenuous exercise or severe emotional distress ventricular tachycardia begins in the lower chambers of the heart and can be life threatening seek immediate treatment if you have another cardiac condition and experience rapid heart beat ventricular tachycardia may be caused by lack of oxygen in the heart medication sarcoidosis an inflammatory disease or distortion of the structure of the heart due to disease some medications particularly when they are combined with others can trigger bouts of tachycardia as a negative side effect more specifically anti arrhythmic drugs used to treat abnormal heart rhythms digitalis asthma medications steroid therapy and most cold cough remedies are well known to increase heart rate ask your doctor if your prescription medication s could trigger tachycardia as an unwanted side effect due to complex chemical interactions in the human body it s virtually impossible to predict how more than two medications taken concurrently may interact with each other read the list of side effects of your drugs carefully if you suspect a medication is triggering bouts of tachycardia don t stop taking the drug cold turkey without the supervision of your doctor it may cause worse symptoms it s better to wean yourself off a medication and then switch to another with similar actions cardiovascular disease particularly atherosclerosis increases blood pressure and makes your heart work harder by beating faster high blood cholesterol is a primary risk factor for atherosclerosis which involves clogged arteries from plaque build up clogged arteries trigger higher blood pressure hypertension which then often translates into higher than normal heart rate ask your doctor about lifestyle changes and medications that can keep blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control so you can reduce your risk of tachycardia normal blood cholesterol levels are less than 200 mg dl whereas healthy blood pressure is less than 135 80 mmhg reduce saturated and trans fats in your diet and eat more fresh fruits and vegetables whole grains and nuts if lifestyle and dietary changes don t lower cholesterol levels significantly then medication may be needed cholesterol lowering medications include statins niacin based drugs bile acid resins fibric acid derivatives and cholesterol absorption inhibitors common medications for high blood pressure include thiazide diuretics beta blockers ace inhibitors calcium channel blockers and renin inhibitors if no other cause of your tachycardia can be found and dietary lifestyle changes or vagal maneuvers don t help much then medication will likely be needed primary causes of tachycardia that require medicine include cardiomyopathy congestive heart failure myocarditis and heart valve disease anti arrhythmic medications can quickly reduce heart rates especially if they are given via injection other medications that may be prescribed and often used in combination with anti arrhythmic drugs are calcium channel blockers diltiazem verapami and beta blockers metoprolol esmolol during an emergency situation a doctor or nurse at the hospital may inject a quick acting anti arrhythmic drug lidocaine procainamide sotalol amiodarone into a vein to treat an acute case of tachycardia patients who are at risk for tachycardia may also be given a slow acting oral anti arrhythmic medication flecainide or propafenone to take at home at the onset of tachycardia catheter ablation is an invasive procedure recommended when an extra electrical pathway sending too many signals to the heart is responsible for chronic tachycardia it involves inserting a catheter into a groin neck or arm vein and maneuvering it to the heart where electrodes at the tip of the catheter destroy the extra electrical pathway with either heat cold or radio frequencies catheter ablation is very effective especially for ventricular tachycardia it can also be used to treat atrial fibrillations and flutters catheter procedures carry a risk of damaging veins and dislodging emboli that can cause a heart attack or stroke it may also damage the walls of the heart and affect the electrical system of the heart tests that your doctor can use to detect a ventricular tachycardia include a continuous ambulatory electrocardiogram ecg a regular ecg and an intracardiac electrophysiology study surgery is a last resort for controlling tachycardia but for some it may be the only effective option there are a couple of different devices that can be implanted into your chest that are effective for treating tachycardia such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators more invasive procedures involve open heart surgery to either destroy extra electrical pathways or repair heart damage directly a pacemaker is a small device placed under the skin that sends electrical impulses to the heart when it senses abnormal heartbeats it helps the heart resume normal contractions rhythms and rates a pacemaker is used to treat bradycardia abnormally slow heart beat when it is used for tachycardia it is typically combined with a heart rate control medication and or rfa of the tachycardic focus an implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd is a cellphone sized device implanted in the chest like a pacemaker but it s connected to the heart with wires an icd delivers precisely calibrated electrical shocks when it senses an abnormal heart rate ask your doctor which of these devices is most appropriate for your tachycardia 
query	173	create an overall status workbook in xl and vba for your wikihow articles those of you who love to author wikihow articles might like to have a system in place for tracking your article views and projecting when you ll reach goals you can do this by creating a workbook with a worksheet that will allow you to sort by category or view quantity find the most viewed or the zeroes the design in this tutorial includes a worksheet that tracks your related wikihows in case you have a habit of including some of your own nearly every time you write a new article while also populating old articles with the new article as a fresh related lastly there is a category analysis that lets you know how your categorizing is doing or how you might improve it either by generalizing or specifying ws article views and other preparation the header region the middle section left part of macro b section the lower macro b section data for macros monthly projections macro b section ws daily sort enter headers input formulas and data ws relateds input the relateds subtotals enter the relateds totals the macro n section of relateds ws cat analysis the top analysis section enter headers for cat analysis totals by category seen the macros of overall status open excel from the desktop green x icon on the dock or from within the applications folder in the microsoft office folder open a new workbook and save it as overall status xlsm in capital letters name four worksheets ws from left to right w o quotes as article views and other daily sort relateds and cat analysis set

editor application that has a replace all function and do replace all of with nothing disregarding the quote marks the way the macros work is as follows sub macro01 transfertodaytoyesterday j is daily run by pressing command option alt j first before getting the wikihow data here are the macros including strikethrough macro e that still needs work nan the xlsm means it contains macros for example this author has two id s because one id only allows up to 100 articles and views to be shown using the standard in built layout since more were desirable using this layout a second id was started join wikihow if you haven t already possibly as an anonymous id just so long as you can access other s user pages access in your browser https www wikihow com user chris garthwaite and go to articles started view more and click on it with your mouse carefully select the following group of articles and views without activating them by clicking just to the left of this article then dragging down fairly slowly under control until you can complete the selection with the bottom rightmost number of views for the last article do command v copy it may take a few seconds to update it may take a few seconds to update you can see from the data it s approaching 150 articles and 500 000 article views skewed by a single article in analyzing the data attention should be paid to eliminate such skewing while still being very conscious of it but for the purposes of this article it will be kept simple you will notice that those are conveniently and ever so nicely all live links now clicking on one takes you right to the article you may want to take a second to test that feature you ll notice a used one turns a different color perhaps brown or wine red that s going to prove useful what is not as useful is that it does not open a new tab in your browser but uses the last one used so you may want to hit your back button to get back to where you were page wise or use history this author uses which appears as a hand with a pointing finger on my computer you choose select cell a1 and insert name define it as topleft you can copy the finger and hand from this page for use on your own page if you like it s just a memo to save the workbook by running one of the 2 macros there are two in case something happens to the other people who have suffered losing a lot of work become a bit of a fanatic when it comes to using autosave and frequently save their work do the same for cell b2 for cell b1 use a lavender or hot pink in cell b1 input macro 09 u and input to cell b2 macro 10 g those macros will save the workbook to various folders on this author s imac so you must change the pathnames and so forth to suit yourself the macros will be done all together at the end format cells fill cells c1 c3 yellow you can get those links from your own user page by copying them from the browser window directly while in firefox or explorer or whatever and pasting them into the overall status workbook in excel input by hand the total number of article views per each id to the right these hand input totals will not agree to the worksheet totals by the amount of article views attributable to any new articles written since this article however the total lines and lower references in this article should still be correct because new articles will not have been inserted effectively above this article you can copy all the articles for chris garthwaite to a separate new workbook and figure out a reconciliation if you so desire or you can input the views of any articles since this article as one sum to be subtracted at the left in cell a3 from chris garthwaite input and xhohx input to arrive at a total in a6 equal to the total below once the other input subtotals are also brought over to a4 and a5 enter label new articles to cell b3 in that case and format alignment left format cells b4 c9 bold input to cell c6 total per wikihow and in cell b6 enter the formula b5 b4 and format both b6 and c6 font red format it font bold red size 14 and do insert names create in right column ok even though this total does not agree with the worksheet s total by the amount of new article views after this article for the chris garthwaite id you ll use the correct total wikihow figure to do the monthly projections at right the rest of the worksheet grand totals of views should agree internally this author realizes there are no numbers in column a yet and so you will have zeroes returned temporarily then edit it so that all the b s are f s and the sum approaches 500 000 or more select cell c20 and insert name define it as file save s that s 4 underlines at the end 5 total format cells for a12 font red fill yellow border red boldest outline from there it will be possible to rebuild clear total views to date if need be these daily article view totals can be copied and transposed then sorted from greatest to least value and that should correspond to their values in clear total views to date it is quite noticeable how very often article views trend similarly on the same days of the week also months of the year etc because of school and exam scheduling and other factors surround the cell with a red boldest border fill it yellow and make the font bright red you will start each day by transferring the data that was in today to yesterday via macro 01 using command option j currently that s a18 a158 when this article is completed but if this is not the topmost article then a158 will not be the bottommost cell since a new row will have been inserted for each new article at the top via macro in the cell under the last article enter other under usual circumstances the wikihow numbers will not sum to the hand input total by the amount of views of any new article views written after this article other bugs can occur rarely try refreshing the page s first however several times and give it some time the numbers come out around 5 15am pacific time and the squirrels at the wikihaus are still rubbing the sleep out of their eyes i imagine it does not happen very often more typically the page does not update from the previous day at all because of some server maintenance being done a day might get skipped please update your sheets anyway even with zeroes for the day because the macro has to be on the right day select the cell range h17 158 and do edit fill series 1 for the step value ok you ll re number for your own quantity of articles when you get all done with this and modify it for your own usage it would take too long to have you enter each star correctly so just enter a 1 in column i to the right of the article prepare a broad working capital or cash flows budget and edit fill down 59 cells which is currently accurate as to count if not as to article it gives you an idea anyway and you re just going to edit in your very own hooray notice that cells j1 j14 are blank and useful for collecting these ready to be relateds when you

do format cells font strikethrough the code will be included however in case one of you finds a way to improve upon it and edit this article for now just go to this author s bottommost article and input 3 5 13 and then select from 3 31 15 at next to top down to the bottom and do edit fill series and accept whatever increment is proposed instead of having to input the actual dates of authorship outline in boldest red border and under the n column average enter in the two cells beneath it average days to write next one author wrote over 200 articles per year for example this author starts each week on the slow day of saturday in cell m10 because on saturday what s actually being reported are pretty likely to be friday night s returns when a lot of people are out on dates if on the other hand your subject matter is all about dating whereas mine is about math saturday might just be your heaviest traffic day this author just likes to know what the probable low point for the week is likely to be because that can indicate an overall strong or weak week right away so for example the closest saturday to 3 31 was 3 28 so i entered 3 27 15 to cell m11 format cell m11 and n11 fill

we re getting into the next worksheet daily sort you ll notice nq 150 holds the summary information for april 2015 in nz 150 on daily sort are total article views to date over all periods therefore if for any reason total article views as held by o4 today less total article views to date less april s should be less than 0 return the value directly below in cell s5 otherwise return the total to date in o4 less the total to date in nz 150 less less plus the april views to date nq 150 the wikihow system gives us total views to date all the time it s up to us to gather each week s views and each month s views until o4 gets total views of the current day input into it by macro b it is empty so when it subtracts total views to date less april s even if april s are 0 it gets a big negative so it takes the number in s5 below it until the cell in column o to the left is updated that s fine if it happens to be april but what if it s march on the daily sort worksheet in the next cell to the left np 150 are march s total views on article views views and other n m7 is 03 31 15 and in m6 is 04 01 15 so you see why this has been saved this for last you have to manually update this formula at month s end with the correct next cell to the right from the next sheet daily sort that s 2 underlines and a 1 so it sorts to the top of the variable names list if not already done do so now down to end sub in advanced editing in wikihow and pasted into a text editor or word processor like word that has a replace all function you want to replace all without the quotes with nothing you then want to record a dummy macro in excel in the overall status xlsm workbook and paste the replace d all text over the dummy macro there are other ways to go about it but that s quick and dirty and gets the job done save the workbook run the macro either from the macros tool icon or by pressing command option alt p sub macro04 tfr views thruout p macro04 tfr views thruout p macro transfer views daily

topleft macro09 pinksave uactiveworkbook save application goto reference file save s end sub also on the transposed section in relateds the formatting will not get copied over and that will need to get fixed at some point by copying over the formatting and then manually resetting it no time for that now it should read with your head turned 90 degrees left justified vertically down with word wrap if there is ever a lingering new article name in a4 just delete it or fix the macro code to do so article views and other a 12 a 163 and transfer it exactly to nexter and beneath it it will then name the next top cell to the right nexter so that it can proceed to do the same thing the next day and each day that is the day s views not the total views as of that date will be transferred however you have just transferred with macro03 to defined cell range name 02 the total views as of today s date if you had yesterday s total views plus today s day s views you would then have today s total views separated so what you need is a starting point of total views you will then add each day s views across to become the month to date s views they will become that month s views then you will add your starting point to all the months and agree it to wikihow s total views as of today thus you will have gained insight into how you are doing per article per day and by month whereas on article views and other you were watching it for the current week average and projected month so in j1 enter 01 01 15 if 2015 is the current year and format cells number date mm dd select the cell range for all 365 days of the year or 366 days in 2016 i e over right from j1 nj1 and do edit fill series step value 1 ok for cell cv1 do insert name define nexter ok just whichever row 1 date you start the process on make sure to insert name define as nexter when nexter has updated column cv remember to do the following enter to cv3 the label don t dbl count and enter to cv4 the label this column format cells font red bold the next thing to do is to put in the bottom formulas enter to cell cv154 the formula day cv151 and enter to cv155 the formula sum cv 150 cv150 and enter to cell cv156 the formula cv155 30 cv154 put a boldest red border at the top of cell cv154 a left boldest border down cells cv154 cv156 and a bottom red boldest border for cell cv156 then put a boldest red border around each month because you will need to change the middle formula for each month you can split and freeze the screen at j5 so you can see the upper dates to make this job easier or copy them temporarily nearby below we want that to continue on through all of april and then stop and start afresh for may enter to dz155 the formula sum dz 150 dz150 and edit paste special formulas that across for all of may surround april and may and each new month with format cells border red boldest outlineenter to fe155 the formula sum fe 150 fe150 and edit paste special formulas that across for all of june do the red boldest

special formulas that across for all of december do the red boldest border for december go back and do january february and march as well please even though you ll get errors this sheet will prove useful in future years remember to do the red boldest border for each month you can hide columns you re finished studying or which contain no data it might be best to leave 01 01 showing so you remember it s all there but hidden bear in mind that macro t does not look for a date but instead for whichever cell is named nexter that is what will next be updated the article views as of 01 17 15 the starting point are included below in cells nl37 nl147 this column adds across all the activity from 1 18 15 to 1 31 15 starting in cell nm33 is the formula sum aa33 an33 and it has been copied and pasted down to nm147 in cell nn6 is the formula nl6 nm6 and that has been copied and pasted down to cell nn147 in cell no6 is the formula sum ao6 br6 and that has been copied and pasted down to no147 edit copy nl150 and edit paste it to cell range nm150 nz150 that should equal 0 and proves that the spread equals the number from wikihow counting all the 1 s of that meant counting all the article days per article on which there were 0 article views these were summed and the total column was sorted from greatest to least to find out which articles were having the most zero views days the formulas were edit paste special values back atop themselves to conserve memory and the sort was undone by sorting on article number from highest to least many various sorts are possible in this worksheet some dependent upon the categories yet to be input it s a pretty big job and it s left up to you as to whether you really want to do it or not almost every article has two categories it uses which is the current maximum available as an example of how it works in the spreadsheet rank would list something like 1 02 which would mean seen mathematics and two calculating volume and area since many articles are categorized in the same rank s sorting them by rank order is meaningful the formula is h6 i6 copied and pasted down then copied again entirely and paste special values atop itself to preserve memory if you usually only use one category you might still want to leave columnar space for two as you might someday change your mind if wikihow changes and permits 3 categories then a system of rank looking like 01 12 02 will still sort just fine as a string so long as there is actually a leading zero you may have to use a formula to add one on like this 0 rank for just the single digit leads where the rank column has been defined as defined variable name rank or 0 text rank 0 00 else 10 s might appear right after 1 s there is just really no simple way for this author to convey the spreadout of relateds article across the entire worksheet to you 142 142 20164 each cell in cell range j10 ev152 either has is blank or has a 1 in it the 1 indicating that the intersection of the horizontal row article holds the vertical article as a related wikihow vertically that means that the vertical article is held by n many horizontal articles currently if you think about it from a user s perspective it might be nice to have a way back to the article you just came from but that s not essential when allocation space is short at ten articles only max it s far more important that the article be actually related firstly and secondly it s preferable for recent articles to support current articles generally speaking on the assumption that one s readership is already acquainted with older articles it has been observed that readership of popular articles remains consistently high but that all readership of older articles declines with age it is important not only to be writing high quality new articles that earn rising star or featured article status it is also important from time to time to freshen up the older articles where possible one way of doing this is to change their relateds although the most recent 42 articles account for just 3 of total views to date they often account for around 25 of today s views that is a very important fact to know and use it means that a good portion of one s following is keeping very current with one s authorship this article already has 24 views and it is tagged with an inuse template as well as being not yet reviewed for quality so the readership is pretty hungry for the latest thing it is thought the article has modifications being made in the middle of it so it has to be re read to make complete sense and still they persist this author admires their tenacity and feels extremely devoted to them per their own devotion this author does his level best best to get it right on the first draft this author does not track other author s related wikihows the reason is because it s difficult to keep track of what the rest of the world is doing let alone just oneself however the possibility of tracking other author s relateds posted to one s articles is feasible within this system and not all that unwieldy another objective might be to delete relateds subtracted as a group that were in excess of the 10 relateds per article limit in that case you would be deleting 1 s instead of adding them the final list in b166 on should have formulas which deliver out the article name without brackets 9 use macro 07 08 n and then command v to find the article in row 1 searcher and when the input box comes up do command v paste click ok for the input box afterwards 10 use the down arrow and row heights 0 to post a 1 quickly to the article the relateds one macro run by the next or manually is faster if they are all in a row l 11 click on the next article name row in this worksheet and color it by group of about 6 15 articles and repeat until done update changes calibri body font is used mostly size 12 or 14 your favorite font is a matter of personal preference as is its size which is why it has been left until now mostly to state a preference input cells or cells which are important or may be modified other than those pasted in from wikihow may be color filled canary yellow even if the macros do the changing you may want to work out your own style system as is preferable to you the more important a cell is the more likely it is to receive a boldest border often in red it s been left up to you to adjust your row heights and column widths to automatically fit the data all along however for column a where the ready tobe relateds formulas and pasted values run quite long this author has a column width of only 5 36 more than enough and a frozen window at cell j7 cell h7 contains xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx and column i is hidden as is column f columns c d are minimal in order to see if any rising star objects somehow made it through the deletion subprocedure of macro p there is room for improvement one needs to give it serious consideration currently because no relateds have been done for this article yet there are 1416 relateds assigned out of 1420 142 articles 10 relateds article allowed 4 under however there are 271 under 10 19 41 520 at 10 36 72 for a subtotal of 55 86 at 10 or under and 625 over 10 44 14 the balance sometimes there are 11 or 12 related wikihows sometimes up to 15 all in all it is below the total allowed overall that may be a bit of fudgery and other s relateds are not counted in the system but it s felt to be fair all things considered with heavier usage articles receiving more attention and lesser used articles receiving less attention so it s proportional to what the users want actually it s meant to please the users after all sometimes it has been as much as 6 over allowed but has always been trimmed back to be within the limit the system also does not count links within an article that are not down in the relateds section e g in the article how to teach or learn math trig and xl with enthusiasm but that is a rare treatment not the standard someone counting actual links will thus arrive at a somewhat greater number this article also falls into that category but only temporarily as a model for the user to build their own article list as

relateds counts and low view counts have low relateds counts typically though some low view articles are promoted via higher relateds spreads all in all though a balance is achieved promoting the visibility of an article for awhile may be just the boost it needs and a unique coloring fill can alert the eye to which articles have been so adjusted and their history can be checked on the daily sort worksheet to see if progress has been made or not there is a macro n for inputting relateds to an article on this worksheet the actual updating of the article with relateds in wikihow has to be done in the usual way though the pre formatting and pre grouping that can be achieved either in column a on relateds or usually column j of article views and other helps quite a bit do the same for

wrote the old ones and the new articles are related in such a case where the old article is down the list a ways you will probably want to hide the rows in between the old article and row 9 so that you can reach it faster once the macro and you find the right vertical article in row 1 to update the macro n does not do this for you but because it s all in a convenient column and the links are live it s a simple matter to click on a link edit in the ready to be a related new article s column a format copied from cell a10 and then put a 1 in column j to the right of the old article whose row you re updating below and whose link is now conveniently a new distinct color also be warned that about the first thing that macro n does is to delete the first entry so be sure to place your entries in to a167 and not a166 if the macro does not work right on the first try look at the cell range a166 e166 and see what s in it if it s an article it s about to get deleted if it s empty it needs the x s and formulas then try the macro again and it should work fine sometimes perhaps you forgot you have to press command v to paste into the macro s inputbox the article name the macro just copied at cell b166 you might think you re supposed to type in the name of the article but that would have been way too time consuming that way you needn t insert a new category type within the bounds of the variable definition to have it be included but at the same time it s nice to have the section copyable between the cat analysis ws and the daily sort ws you can sort the columns left to right if and when you put in the type 2 category decimal numbers in row 2 above the concatenations how you choose to sort your data is entirely up to you there is nothing in column b seen is in cell d292 the second part starts on row 307 thus 0 01 is in cell c307 and mathematics is in cell e307 some of type two categories are copyable from the seen categories so for example enter totals into cell o302 for microsoft excel and into cell o307 for mathematics and enter totals into cell p294 for msxl imagery and into p307 for mathematics continue this way across to the right until complete edit the formula in k309 to be sum k307 k328 and surround it in format cells border black outline boldest create a dummy macro assuming you have enabled developer in excel preferences on the ribbon or otherwise by recording a tiny macro and then copying this macro code over it you may find it useful to split it up into 3 modules or perhaps not that is what is indicated in the top section of article views and other by mod n etc you create a new module using the visual basic editor each sub to end sub procedure must be separated by a blank line and not have any crapola between subprocedures comments effected with preceding apostrophes may go in at the beginning middle or end of cod or after lines after a space to continue a line of code use space underline then probably indent the next line watch for where this has already been done for you however please it transfers f16 f161 to b16 b161 because the new data from wikihow will presumably have larger views to report per article and we want to subtract yesterday s from today s that we re about to bring in so first we have to transfer what was today to yesterday the result of the subtraction in column a since the totals are views to date will be just today s results next use the links in c3 and c2 to daily access the wikihow data you transfer in the wikihow data as explained above by selecting in the chris garthwaite data from this article downwards the article title and views and copy it and paste it into c17 then do the same for xhohx s 100 articles but below the data you just pasted in for chris the later id next daily post from the wikihow pages the summary of the total article views to cells a4 and a5 and possibly subsequently written line item article views as a negative sum to a3 reconcile the totals next daily run

query	174	calculate a square root by hand in the days before calculators students and professors alike had to calculate square roots by hand several different methods have evolved for tackling this daunting process some giving a rough approximation others giving an exact value to learn how to find a number s square root using only simple operations see step 1 below to get started using prime factorization finding square roots manually using a long division algorithm understanding the process divide your number into perfect square factors take the square roots of your perfect square factors if your number doesn t factor perfectly reduce your answer to simplest terms if needed estimate alternatively reduce your number to its lowest common factors as your first step separate your number s digits into pairs find the largest integer n whose square is lesser than or equal to the leftmost number or pair subtract the number you just calculated from the leftmost pair drop down the next pair fill in the blank spaces in the right quadrant subtract the number you just calculated from the current number on the left repeat step 4 repeat step 5 and 6 to continue to calculate digits drop a pair of zeros on the left and repeat steps 4 5 and 6 consider the number you are calculating the square root of as the area s of a square specify letter variables for each digit of your answer specify letter variables for each chunk of your starting number understand this method s connection to long division find the biggest number whose square is less than or equal to sa visualize the square whose area you are beginning to solve subtract a from sa look for n1 2 10a b b also written as n1 2 10a b b solve subtract the area 2 10a b b from the total area to calculate the next digit c repeat the process this method uses a number s factors to find a number s square root depending on the number this can be an exact numerical answer or a close estimate a number s factors are any set of other numbers that multiply together to make it for instance you could say that the factors of 8 are 2 and 4 because 2 4 8 perfect squares on the other hand are whole numbers that are the product of other whole numbers for instance 25 36 and 49 are perfect squares because they are 52 62 and 72 respectively perfect square factors are as you may have guessed factors that are also perfect squares to start finding a square root via prime factorization first try to reduce your number into its perfect square factors let s use an example we want to find the square root of 400 by hand to begin we would divide the number into perfect square factors since 400 is a multiple of 100 we know that it s evenly divisible by 25 a perfect square quick mental division lets us know that 25 goes into 400 16 times 16 coincidentally is also a perfect square thus the perfect square factors of 400 are 25 and 16 because 25 16 400 we would write this as sqrt 400 sqrt 25 16 the product property of square roots states that for any given numbers a and b sqrt a b sqrt a sqrt b because of this property we can now take the square roots of our perfect square factors and multiply them together to get our answer in our example we would take the square roots of 25 and 16 see below sqrt 25 16 sqrt 25 sqrt 16 5 4 20 in real life more often than not the numbers you ll need to find square roots for won t be be nice round numbers with obvious perfect square factors like 400 in these cases it may not be possible to find the exact answer as an integer instead by finding any perfect square factors that you can you can find the answer in terms of a smaller simpler easier to manage square root to do this reduce your number to a combination of perfect square factors and non perfect square factors then simplify let s use the square root of 147 as an example 147 isn t the product of two perfect squares so we can t get an exact integer value as above however it is the product of one perfect square and another number 49 and 3 we can use this information to write our answer in simplest terms as follows sqrt 147 sqrt 49 3 sqrt 49 sqrt 3 7 sqrt 3 with your square root in simplest terms it s usually fairly easy to get a rough estimate of a numerical answer by guessing the value of any remaining square roots and multiplying through one way to guide your estimates is to find the perfect squares on either side of the number in your square root you ll know that the decimal value of the number in your square root is somewhere between these two numbers so you ll be able to guess in between them let s return to our example since 22 4 and 12 1 we know that sqrt 3 is between 1 and 2 probably closer to 2 than to 1 we ll estimate 1 7 7 1 7 11 9 if we check our work in a calculator we can see that we re fairly close to the actual answer of 12 13 this works for larger numbers as well for example sqrt 35 can be estimated to be between 5 and 6 probably very close to 6 52 25 and 62 36 35 is between 25 and 36 so its square root must be between 5 and 6 since 35 is just one away from 36 we can say with confidence that its square root is just lower than 6 checking with a calculator gives us an answer of about 5 92 we were right finding perfect square factors isn t necessary if you can easily determine a number s prime factors factors that are also prime numbers write your number out in terms of its lowest common factors then look for matching pairs of prime numbers among your factors when you find two prime factors that match remove both these numbers from the square root and place one of these numbers outside the square root as an example let s find the square root of 45 using this method we know that 45 9 5 and we know that 9 3 3 thus we can write our square root in terms of its factors like this sqrt 3 3 5 simply remove the 3 s and put one 3 outside the square root to get your square root in simplest terms 3 sqrt 5 from here it s simple to estimate as one final example problem let s try to find the square root of 88 sqrt 88 sqrt 2 44 sqrt 2 4 11 sqrt 2 2 2 11 we have several 2 s in our square root since 2 is a prime number we can remove a pair and put one outside the square root our square root in simplest terms is 2 sqrt 2 11 or 2 sqrt 2 sqrt 11 from here we can estimate sqrt 2 and sqrt 11 and find an approximate answer if we wish this method uses a process similar to long division to find an exact square root digit by digit though it s not essential you may find that it s easiest to perform this process if you visually organize your workspace and your number into workable chunks first draw a vertical line separating your work area into two sections then draw a shorter horizontal line near the top of the right section to divide the right section into a small upper section and a larger lower section next separate your number s digits into pairs starting from the decimal point for instance following this rule 79 520 789 182 47897 becomes 7 95 20 78 91 82 47 89 70 write your number at the top of the left space as an example let s try calculating the square root of 780 14 draw two lines to divide your workspace as above and write 7 80 14 at the top of the left space it s o k that the leftmost chunk is a lone number rather than a pair of numbers you will write your answer the square root of 780 14 in the top right space start with the leftmost chunk of your number whether this is a pair or a single number find the largest perfect square that s less than or equal to this chunk then take the square root of this perfect square this number is n write n in the top right space and write the square of n in the bottom right quadrant in our example the leftmost chunk is the number 7 since we know that 22 4 7 32 9 we can say that n 2 because it s the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to 7 write 2 in the top right quadrant this is the first digit of our answer write 4 the square of 2 in the bottom right quadrant this number will be important in the next step as with long division the next step is to subtract the square we just found from the chunk we just analyzed write this number underneath the first chunk and subtract writing your answer underneath in our example we would write 4 below 7 then subtract this gives us an answer of 3 move the next chunk in the number whose square root you re solving for down next to the subtracted value you just found next multiply the number in the top right quadrant by two and write it in the bottom right quadrant next to the number you just wrote down set aside space for a multiplication problem you ll do in the next step by writing in our example the next pair in our number is 80 write 80 next to the 3 in the left quadrant next multiply the number in the top right by two this number is 2 so 2 2 4 write 4 in the bottom right quadrant followed by you must fill each blank space you ve just written in the right quadrant with the same integer this integer must be the largest integer that allows the result of the multiplication problem in the right quadrant to be lower than or equal to the current number on the left in our example filling in the blank spaces with 8 gives us 4 8 8 48 8 384 this is greater than 380 therefore 8 is too big but 7 will probably work write 7 in the blank spaces and solve 4 7 7 329 7 checks out because 329 is less than 380 write 7 in the top right quadrant this is the second digit in the square root of 780 14 continue with the long division style chain of subtraction take the result of the multiplication problem in the right quadrant and subtract it from the current number on the left writing your answer below in our example we would subtract 329 from 380 which gives us 51 drop the next chunk of the number you re finding the square root of down when you reach the decimal point in your number write a decimal point in your answer in the top right quadrant then multiply the number in the top right by 2 and write it next to the blank multiplication problem as above in our example since we are now encountering the decimal point in 780 14 write a decimal point after our current answer the top right next drop the next pair 14 down in the left quadrant two times the number on the top right 27 is 54 so write 54 in the bottom right quadrant find the biggest digit to fill in the blanks on the right that gives an answer lesser than or equal to the current number on the left then solve the problem in our example 549 9 4941 which is lower than or equal to the number on the left 5114 549 10 5490 which is too high so 9 is our answer write 9 as the next digit in the top right quadrant and subtract the result of the multiplication from the number on the left 5114 minus 4941 is 173 for added accuracy continue repeating this process to find the hundredth thousandth etc places in your answer proceed through this cycle until you find your answer to the desired decimal place because a square s area is l2 where l is the length of one of its sides therefore by trying to find the square root of your number you are trying to calculate the length l of the side of that square assign the variable a as the first digit of l the square root we are trying to calculate b will be its second digit c its third and so on assign the variable sato the first pair of digits in s your starting value sb the second pair of digits etc this method of finding a square root is essentially a long division problem that divides your starting number by its square root thus giving its square root as an answer just like in a long division problem in which you are only interested by the next one digit at a time here you are interested by the next two digits at a time which correspond to the next digit at a time for the square root the first digit a in our answer is then the biggest integer where the square does not exceed sa meaning a so that a sa a 1 in our example sa 7 and 2 7 3 so a 2 note that for instance if you wanted to divide 88962 by 7 via long division the first step would be similar you would be looking at the first digit of 88962 8 and you would want the biggest digit that when multiplied by 7 is lower than or equal to 8 essentially you re finding d so that 7 d 8 7 d 1 in this case d would be equal to 1 your answer the square root of your starting number is l which describes the length of a square with area s your starting number your values for a b c represent the digits in the the value l another way of saying this is that for a two digit answer 10a b l while for a three digit answer 100a 10b c l and so on in our example 10a b l2 s 100a 2 10a b b remember that 10a b represents our answer l with b in the units position and a in the tens position for instance with a 1 and b 2 10a b is simply the number 12 10a b is the area of the whole square while 100a the area of the biggest square inside b is the area of the smallest square and 10a b is the area of each of the two remaining rectangles by performing this long convoluted process we find the area of the entire square by adding up the areas of the squares and rectangles inside it drop one pair sb of digits from s sa sb is nearly the total area of the square which you just subtracted the area of the bigger internal square from the remainder is can be though of as the number n1 which we obtained in step 4 n1 380 in our example n1 is equal to 2 10a b b area of the two rectangles plus area of the small square in our example you already know n1 380 and a 2 so you need to find b b is most likely not going to be an integer so you must actually find the biggest integer b so that 2 10a b b n1 so you have n1 2 10a b 1 b 1 to solve this equation multiply a by 2 shift it in the position of the tens which is equivalent to multiplying by 10 place b in the position of the units and multiply the resulting number by b in other words solve 2 10a b b this is exactly what you do when you write n with n 2 a in the bottom right quadrant in step 4 in step 5 you find the biggest integer b that fits on the underscore so that 2 10a b b n1 this gives you the area s 10a b not yet accounted for and which will be used to calculate the next digits in a similar fashion drop the next pair sc from s to obtain n2 on the left and look for the biggest c so you have 2 10 10a b c c n2 equivalent to writing two times the two digit number a b followed by look for the biggest digit that fits in the blanks that gives an answer that is less than or equal to n2 as before 
query	175	establish a charitable foundation in nigeria in this article you will be able to consider the meaning of a charitable trust and the various types of charitable trust possible in nigeria we shall examine the mode and procedure for creating charitable trust and thereafter outline the various types of charitable trust we shall proceed to consider existing charitable organizations in nigeria their successes shortcomings as well as their challenges we shall conclude by suggesting measures that will ensure higher productivity of charitable organizations in nigeria steps understand that a charitable trust means a public trust note that for a trust to be said to be charitable the objective of the trust as declared by the settlor or as implied from his intention must be charitable realize that the definition is broader note that the nigerian criminal code act which is applicable in the southern states of nigeria prohibits certain societies as unlawful based on their activities create a charitable trust consider the incorporated charitable trust which is a bone of contention note that a charitable organization registered under cama is capable of being wounded up be aware that many registered charitable organizations prefer to register as a company limited by guarantee rather than as an association with incorporated trustees know what charitable trusts exist in nigeria establish a trust for the relief of poverty establish a trust for the advancement of education establish a trust for the advancement of religion establish a trust for the advancement of good health establish a trust for other purposes beneficial to the community or class in the society it is necessary to define the concept of trust before considering charitable trust trust is a relationship existing between two or more parties in which one party called the trustee holds the legal title to real or personal property subject to an obligation imposed by a court of equity or expressly undertaken to keep or use the property for the benefit of another called the beneficiary or cestui que trust the party who creates a trust is known as the settlor the settlor may make herself or himself either trustee or beneficiary a charitable trust is one of the types of trust it arises where a settlor creates a trust for public or group welfare or for charitable purposes just like every other trust there is the requirement of three certainties for the creation of charitable trust as established in knight v knight there must be certainty of words intention certainty of subject matter trust property and certainty of object beneficiaries where there is no certainty of object i e where the named beneficiaries do not exist the cypress doctrine may be applied to apply the trust property to a class of beneficiaries similar or close to the one mentioned by the settlor there is no specific limit as to what constitute charitable purpose the preamble of the statute of uses act 1601 reveals some purposes of trust constituting charitable trust these include among others trust created for the relief of aged impotent and poor people for the maintenance of the sick and maimed soldiers and mariners for the establishment of school of learning free schools scholarship in the universities for the repair of bridges ports havens churches sea banks and high ways and finally for the education and preferment of orphans we are not restricted to the purposes mentioned in the statute of uses act above we shall be classifying the purposes of charitable trust basically into five namely trust for the relief of poverty trust for the advancement of education trust for the advancement of religion trust for the advancement of good health andtrust for other purposes beneficial to the community societies of persons are unlawful if formed for any of the following purposes levying war or encouraging or assisting any person to levy war on the government or the inhabitants of any part of nigeria killing or injuring or encouraging the killing or injuring of any person destroying or injuring or encouraging the destruction or injuring of any property subverting or promoting the subversion of the government or its officials committing or inciting to acts of violence or intimidation interfering with or resisting or encouraging interference with or resistance to the administration of the law ordisturbing or encouraging the disturbance of peace and order in any part of nigeria any organization formed for any of the above purposes cannot be said to be charitable to start with charitable trusts may be set up inter vivos during a donor s life or as a part of a trust or will at death as testamentary the law governing voluntary non profit charitable organizations in nigeria is a product of english common law as well as statutory law we need to mention at this stage that it is not mandatory for charitable organizations to be registered as an incorporated company under the companies and allied matters act hereinafter referred to as cama the unincorporated charitable trust under traditional common law is also recognized in nigeria however many of the charitable organizations we shall be considering in this work are registered because the unincorporated charitable trust is a generic creature of the common law rather than of specific nigerian statutory law apart from the unincorporated charitable trust under the common law the constitution of the federal republic of nigeria 1999 states that every person shall be entitled to assemble freely and associate with other persons and in particular he may form or belong to any association for the protection of his interests thus with certain derogations people may come together to form unincorporated associations such unincorporated associations are however not eligible for tax benefits which incorporated charitable organizations are entitled to under the companies income tax act cita because the information relevant to making an equivalency determination will necessarily be contained in the governing documents of each unincorporated association cita exempts from tax the profits of companies engaged in certain public benefit activities so long as the profits are not derived from trade or a business undertaking and donations made by individuals are not tax deductible the activities listed in the companies income tax act for purposes of tax exemption and deductibility of donations indicate which types of activities are considered to be of public benefit these include activities that are ecclesiastical are charitable are educational or promote sports however nigerian not for profit companies are subject to a value added tax vat under the value added tax act 1993 the vat amendment act 2007 and the federal inland revenue service establishment act 2007 a charitable organization may be registered under cama as a company limited by guarantee or as an association with incorporated trustees with respect to registration as a company limited by guarantee section 26 1 of cama provides that where a company is to be formed for the promotion of commerce art science religion sports culture education research charity or other similar objects and the income and property of the company is applied solely towards the promotion of its objects and no portion thereof is to be paid or transferred directly or indirectly to the members of the company except as permitted by this act the company shall not be registered as a company limited by shares but may be registered as a company limited by guarantee by section 26 2 of cama the company limited by guarantee shall not be registered with a share capital and does not issue shares and so does not create ownership rights in any persons legal or natural it is though an artificial person capable of suing and being sued any provision in the memorandum articles or any resolution of the company that purports to divide the company s undertaking into shares or interests is void furthermore a charitable organization may be registered as a corporate body under cama as an association with incorporated trustees an association of persons which appoints one or more trustees and pursues registration under part c of the companies and allied matters act is called an association with incorporated trustees upon registration the trustee or trustees become a body corporate and has have perpetual succession as well as the power to sue and be sued on behalf of the association under section 673 of cama there are essentially two forms of associations with incorporated trustees the first form occurs where the trustees are appointed by any community of persons bound together by customs religion kinship or nationality the second form is identified by the fact that the trustees are appointed by any body or association of persons established for any religious educational literary scientific social development cultural sporting or charitable purpose particularly section 674 of cama provides for the facts that must be stated in the application for registration which include among other things the name of the proposed body which must contain the words incorporated trustees of xxx the section also states that the aims and objects of the association must be stated and it must be for the advancement of any religious education literary scientific social development cultural sporting or charitable purpose and must be lawful it must be mentioned that no portion of the income and property of a body or an association with incorporated trustees may be paid or transferred directly or indirectly by way of dividend bonus or otherwise to the members of the association however associations with incorporated trustees may pay their employees reasonable remuneration for services rendered it is interesting to know that the cama recognized the doctrine of cypress doctrine section 26 9 of cama provides that upon dissolution a company limited by guarantee must transfer any property remaining after the discharge of all its debts and liabilities to another company limited by guarantee with similar objects or must apply the remaining property to some charitable object the company or charity receiving the property must be determined by the members prior to dissolution none of the property remaining after a company limited by guarantee discharges its debts and liabilities may be distributed among its members in a similar vein upon dissolution of an association with incorporated trustees it must transfer any property remaining after the satisfaction of all its debts and liabilities to other institutions having similar objects these institutions will be determined by the members of the association at or before the time of dissolution no property may be paid to or distributed among the members of the association by the provisions of section 691 5 of cama if for some reason the remaining property cannot be transferred to institutions with similar objects the remaining property will be transferred to some charitable object this connotes that there would be no resulting trust in favor of the subscribers to the organization whichever way it is advisable that charitable organizations should be registered under cama even though they have the constitutional right not to do that as earlier observed we shall now consider each of the types of charitable organization as evident from the relevant sections of cama with particular reference to existing charitable organizations in nigeria under each type we shall be focusing on the followings a trust for the relief of poverty b trust for the advancement of education c trust for the advancement of religion d trust for the advancement of good health ande trust for other charitable purposes beneficial to the community or a class in the society this is a kind of trust created for relatively poor beneficiaries it does not mean that the beneficiaries are necessarily poor but they belong to a class of the society in need of financial assistance or help it may be created for destitute widows pensioners e t can example of a charitable organization for the relief of poverty in nigeria is the richard akinnola foundation established though not yet incorporated by veteran journalist and human right activist richard akinnola in 2009 recently the foundation launches a journalists widows scheme that will cater for the needs of widows of journalists killed in the course of discharging their duties or those that died on active duty according to akinnola there would be a board of trustees for the scheme and it would be registered and institutionalised when that is done we will invite stakeholders to join hands with the foundation and come up with ideas by which we can help the widows of our departed colleagues he said commendably the scheme has been effective since its establishment the first set of beneficiaries were presented with cheques on april 27 2010 at the ladi lawal centre of the lagos state council of the nigeria union of journalists nuj alausa lagos the first set of beneficiaries of the scheme included mrs adeyinka dehinsilu widow of late daily times photo journalist jide dehinsilu who died at the national stadium surulere lagos others included mrs grace oyeleru widow of another photo journalist tunji oyeleru who worked for vanguard till death thereafter mrs ojenike ohu widow of killed guardian reporter bayo ohu mrs lydia efenji widow of killed ait reporter efenji efenji and mrs tonia ike ejeye widow of another ait reporter were all beneficiaries of n50 000 each from the foundation another charitable organization in nigeria under this heading is the ndubizu charitable foundation established in 2004 by prof mrs gordian ndubizu to share the plight of poor widows and orphans by providing small business grants to poor widows and education for poor orphans the foundation is

encourage and fund selfless charitable programs aimed at instilling and enhancing the integrity of persons of less privileged backgrounds to ease the plight of widows through small business grants to design and implement policies and programs that facilitate the development of the social and economic welfare of the underprivileged inhabitants of local communities and to support underprivileged persons particularly members of economically and socially disadvantaged groups and support local national and international humanitarian initiatives with similar objectives as a means of alleviating poverty the geographic reach of the foundation is to support the poor widows and orphans in orlu catholic diocese imo state nigeria orlu catholic diocese comprises of about 30 percent of imo state nigeria this sets a great example for other well to do nigerians to support areas have an association with the foundation has done well since its creation within its geographical reach it is on record that in year 2006 46 poor widows received small business grants 31 poor orphans received scholarships to continue their education and the foundation organized a 2006 christmas and end of the year celebration for poor widows and poor orphans with each receiving christmas gifts for themselves and their families similarly in year 2007 60 poor widows received small business grants and 51 poor orphans received scholarships to continue their education this achievement is indeed encouraging furthermore another charitable organization in nigeria for the relief of poverty is the honey bee foundation a non profit and non governmental organisation established with the primary aim of rendering assistance to all women in distress pregnant school girls victims of rape and widows at all times as and when the situation arises similarly in ekiti state the wife of former ekiti state governor erelu angela ayodele adebayo initiated the erelu adebayo foundation eraf a charitable and non governmental organisation established to cater for the welfare of children the less privileged and women this is a kind of trust created for the support of education of the children youths as well as adults it includes both formal and informal education but does not include political education a progressive educational charitable organization is the rochas foundation which even though established in 1996 primarily for the advancement of education in 1998 its activities span through the areas of health and social responsibilities and economic empowerment the foundation is a non profit non religious non political organization established to give hope to the less privileged children who would not have had access to quality education the objective of the foundation is to build a credible future for africa by ensuring every child has access to free education the performance of this foundation is impressive since its inception the foundation currently have five colleges in nigeria which offer free education to applicants while rochas foundation university is under construction the colleges are located in jos ibadan kano with two in imo state according to okorocha the objective of building the colleges is to provide qualitative but free secondary education for gifted children of the poorest of the poor up to the senior certificate examinations the colleges target bright children from financially handicapped backgrounds whom the educational system would have ordinarily left behind he disclosed that the rochas foundation bears the responsibilities of paying tuition on behalf of all the students in addition to providing them free uniforms text books medical care writing materials and monthly allowances the matron of the college located on onitsha road owerri said the school was not open to children of the well to do in society this school is mainly for orphans or children from very indigent homes said the matron at inception in october 2001 when the owerri college admitted its first batch of students a total of 144 pupils were enrolled that figure was later pruned down to 139 following the withdrawal of five pupils on the grounds of falsification in addition to the above the foundation launched a volunteers corps rfvc for eradicating illiteracy and ignorance militating against children in nigeria and also to help realize the objectives of the foundation the rfvc has also enrolled over 800 students through our university scholarship scheme while rochas foundation university is under construction after the approval was granted in 2009 since inception the act of volunteerism has helped rfvc deliver its promise of eradicating illiteracy and ignorance militating against children by enrolling over 4 300 underprivileged children in rochas foundation colleges the rfvc has also enrolled over 800 students through the rochas foundation university scholarship scheme the foundation also organized seminars workshops that aid the children in career development and skills acquisition students are also given good exposure as they are given the opportunity to tour different nations during the summer holidays there has been debate as to the motive behind the establishment of the rochas foundation following the completion of the five colleges due to the participation in politics of the founder many critics fault the pilot project on the basis that the erstwhile chairman of the nigerian aviation management authority nama embarked on it to get public sympathy in imo state as a display of new wealth in response however okorocha who has been a classroom teacher principal and later school proprietor said rochas foundation is not a display of wealth or affluence but a fulfillment of my covenant with god almighty i have always prayed to god to bless me that i may share with others to feed me that i may feed those who hunger and thirst and i said to god if you bless me i will not forget the downtrodden ones that is exactly why it looks like i m a man of the masses it is just the concern genuine concern for those who do not have it is unfortunate that most people think it is political the response of the founder indeed sounds charitable no wonder the foundation has not restricted its activities to the advancement of education solely part of the charitable work the foundation had bankrolled include sponsorship of baby ogbonna s complicated surgery at the national hospital abuja sponsorship of barrister eddy emekoba s kidney transplant and the donation of typhoid vaccine worth millions of naira to nigerian soldiers

state other beneficiaries such as widows got about ten bags of rice while disabled persons from the three zones in the state received 50 bags of rice the success of the rochas foundation is indeed encouraging and fascinating another charitable organization for the advancement of education in nigeria is the new creation eductaion foundation ncef which was launched in march 1998 and registered then as new creation learning clinic with the corporate affairs commission before it metamorphosed into a full fledge foundation in 2001 the foundation embarks on educational advancement programmes

lightly guide the clippers along your pet s body in order to remove the excess hair be extra gentle around your dog s ears anus genitals underbelly and legs so that you don t cut him going against the growth of your westie s fur may result in a cut that is too short or that looks odd to ensure that you are not trimming too much fur trim with the growth of your westie s fur rather than against it try keeping a brush handy to smooth out the fur and remove stuck on hairs as you go when clipping your westie s fur you will need to trim his whole body with the clippers trim down the fur on his back stomach sides and legs so that it is about two inches long all over do not use the clippers on your westie s head or face you can use scissors to trim hairs on his head and face as needed but you should not have to do much to his face if the blades become hot then they may burn your westie s skin check the blades every couple of minutes to make sure that they are not hot if the blades become hot then turn off the clippers and wait until they cool down before continuing you may notice a few spots that you missed or that were hard to reach with the clippers you can use scissors to touch up these spots but be careful do not put the scissors too close to your westie s body you may also want to use a comb to serve as a guard between your westie s skin and the scissors groomers will often clip more than once and you may want to consider this as well you can clip your westie before you bathe him and then go over his coat with the clippers after bath time to produce a smooth finish on the coat wait until your westie is dry to clip his coat after bathing hair appears longer when it is wet so clipping your westie while he is wet may produce a shorter haircut than desired stripping

make stripping a regular part of grooming your westie if you don t strip your westie regularly you may need to strip all the way down to his undercoat layer which can leave him looking bare to strip your westie you ll need to pull out dead hair with your fingers be aware that this can cause your westie pain or discomfort if you don t know what you re doing do not try to pull out hairs that are still growing out of the skin grasp hairs that are sticking out further than other ones and gently pull on the hairs if the hairs do not come out easily then stop pulling the hairs may not be ready to come out yet always make sure to pull out hairs from the coat in the direction that your westie s fur is growing to make pulling out dead hairs easier and reduce discomfort for your dog go with the grain of your westie s fur rather than against it if you find the coat is slippery or you are having trouble grasping hairs then you can apply a bit of chalk to your hands and fingers the chalk will help you keep a firmer grip on the hair and make it much easier to pull out dead hairs in order to keep your westie s coat clean and soft bathe him every few weeks unless he has a skin problem this can help keep your westie s skin healthy and keep his coat looking lustrous and full you may also want to bathe your westie after you trim his fur to boost the effects and remove lingering fur keep in mind that bathing your westie too often can remove his natural skin oils and make him susceptible to dry skin and other skin problems westies with skin problems such as a yeast infection may require weekly or more frequent bathing with a special medicated dog shampoo it is important to choose a mild shampoo that is formulated for dogs do not use human shampoo on your westie human shampoos can be too harsh on your westie s skin and may even turn his coat pink you can buy shampoos for your westie at pet stores or your vet s office the best way to bathe your westie is by using a hand held showerhead in a bathtub if you do not have a showerhead then a pitcher or large cup also works well place a rubber mat in the tub to keep your westie from slipping you should use warm but not hot water to bathe your westie test the water on the inside of your wrist if it feels comfortable then it should be okay for your westie have a towel ready to dry off your westie after his bath place your westie into the bathtub and start wetting down his fur with the shower head or pitcher after all of his fur is wet then you can apply some shampoo to his fur and start working it in make sure that you

that you applied shampoo to after you have rinsed your westie s fur then wrap him up in a towel and dry him off you should get routine checkups of your westie at a vet which includes assessing the health of his ears in between vet visits you can clean your dog s ears occasionally or if they appear dirty consider asking your vet to show you how to properly clean your westie s ears use a cotton ball dampened in mineral oil hydrogen peroxide or a specific dog ear cleansing solution do not clean your westie s ears too frequently or too deeply this can irritate the delicate skin never insert anything into your dog s ear canal if your westie is sprouting hairs from his ears you might need to tweeze them to prevent tangles or other problems make sure to check with your vet if this is necessary trim your westie s nails whenever they appear too long this can help prevent breaking infection and keep your dog from developing an irregular gait because his nails are too long never use scissors to trim your dog s nails only use a dog nail clipper that you can purchase at a pet store or your vet s office go slow and be careful when you trim your dog s nails you don t want to hurt your dog when trimming your westie s nails avoid getting too close to the quick which is the blood vessel inside of the nail you can avoid the quick by trimming a small sliver of nail at a time and checking the cut surface of the nail after each snip when you start to see a circle around the cut surface then you are getting close to the quick and should not trim any more cutting your dog s nails after a bath will make the quick more visible you can also apply some baby oil to his nail which will have the same effect give your westie a treat for a successful nail clipping session if your dog is resistant to the nail trimming don t force him leave him alone and try again later keep in mind that you can always take your dog to a professional groomer or to your veterinarian for nail trimming

query	177	larp larping short for live action role playing is a way to get away from everyday life and explore a world of your own making with friends larping involves acting out fantastical scenarios and engaging in make believe combat with other players while role playing as a fictional character larping can for instance allow a completely normal person to assume the role of a powerful warrior a deadly mage or a sly assassin in adventure scenario with other larpers to learn how to plan and play your own larp game see step 1 below to get started creating a larp universe organizing a larp game taking larping to the next level pick a setting or backdrop for your larp game create a conflict create a character give your character a backstory have any fellow players design their own characters create your own clothing gear and weapons create a scenario for your characters to participate in larp stay in character as you play choose whether to create a larp game or join another s find an area for your larping optionally assign gms decide on a rules system or lack thereof coordinate game logistics with your players start a local larp group participate in massive larp events make and share your own system of rules create a detailed fictional universe the first step of planning any larp session is to decide what sort of scenario you ll play in popular culture larp games are often associated with settings and characters from the fantasy genre of art and literature and works like the lord of the rings novels though many larp games stick to these conventions many do not realistic settings and storylines such as those set in the modern age or based on history are possible as are science fiction and alternate world scenarios be as imaginative as you d like your larp game is the product of your own imagination so there s literally no limit to the types of scenarios you can design for example let s say that for our first larp game we want to attempt a classic middle ages fantasy scenario if we re feeling uninspired we might chose characters and settings from a familiar fantasy universe like those portrayed in the lord of the rings or a song of ice and fire novels however we can also create our own let s be adventurous and do this instead in our scenario we ll be brave warriors from the kingdom of karyphesh for our purposes let s say this is a vast fantasy kingdom that contains a variety of different sub regions this way we ll be able to visit a variety of different settings let s be honest if you re making up your own scenario for the very first time there s a decent chance it will end up being cheesy or hackneyed like the one above this is ok larping is basically playing pretend for grownups so a healthy measure of good humor is advised when playing with time your stories and scenarios will become more nuanced larping can be whatever you want it to be there s no rule that says you have to have a conflict in your larp game if you really want to you can larp a completely uneventful normal day in the life of the world you ve created but why do this when you can have so much more fun with an exciting conflict giving your fictional setting a conflict is a great way to make your larp instantly engaging and to give everyone something to do make a conflict that fits the fictional world you ve created but be creative feel free to add as many minor details and wrinkles to your conception of the central conflict as you desire because much though certainly not all larping involves fictional combat wars or clashes between two or more fictional nations or entities are always a good bet these can be normal wars between humans or can have supernatural aspects it s all up to you regardless of what you choose try to make your fictional conflict engaging and urgent in our example let s say that mysterious demons have begun to terrorize the outer reaches of the kingdom of karyphesh as it stands this is a pretty cliched plot line so let s spice things up by saying that these so called demons have been causing entire villages to disappear leaving only giant symbols in an ancient tongue burnt into the ground in their place as the story unfolds we may find that the so called demons are actually sent by a benevolent deity to protect the kingdom from the true villain the king of karyphesh who wants to convert his subjects into mindless slaves remember that everything is up to you and that the conflict in your world can unfold however you want it to much of the fun of larping lies in the fact that it allows you to be someone or something you are not no one is a valiant knight or a space marine in real life but larpers enjoy pretending to be these types of people and acting the way they imagine they would act if they were real in a word roleplaying based on the setting you ve chosen design a character who fits into your fictional world consider both his or her physical appearance and his or her personality traits ask yourself the following questions what sort of being is my character is s he a human or non human what is his or her name what does s he look like what does s he do for a living anything is possible here though since many larps focus on fantasy combat you may want to choose a profession that would logically confer some martial skill soldier knight pirate assassin thief etc what does s he act like is s he kind or cruel guarded or outgoing fierce or cowardly what sort of knowledge or training does s he have does s he know multiple languages know a craft have an education what quirks does s he have does s he have any bad habits fears odd talents in our example let s say that our character is melchior a royal knight from the capital of karyphesh he is big tall strong tan skinned and has short black hair he usually wears steel armor and carries a massive broadsword however when he s not defending the kingdom he s a total sweetheart and runs a kitten orphanage as a side job what a hunk how does your character fit into the world you ve created what happened in his or her past why does s he do the things s he does these are all things you ll want to consider as you complete your character giving your character a backstory isn t just for flavor on the contrary it s actually a way to give your character a compelling motivation for getting involved in your larp game s conflict a logical backstory can also help guide your decisions as to how your character might participate in the conflict based on past experiences in our example let s say that melchior has a troubled past at the age of 5 his parents were killed by bandits and he was left by the side of the road to die however he was saved by a band of feral cats and raised for two years until he was old enough to strike out on his own after years of poverty he eventually won the favor of a wealthy lord and trained as his squire until becoming a full fledged knight because of his experiences melchior has an undying compassion for cats but sometimes finds it to connect to other people who he often sees as cruel and unloving however he is incredibly loyal to the lord who pulled him out of the gutter and plans to fight for his honor in the coming war against the demons who have killed one of his lord s sons again there s no rule that says you can t larp by yourself but it s usually more fun to interact and do battle with others so try gathering a group of willing friends to larp with you if you can since your friends will be joining you in your fictional world each should design his or her own character complete with backstory so that each person is able to experience the world through the eyes of an active participant in it if you re looking to have fighting and combat as part of your larp session you may want to have some of your friends be characters that are opposed to your own such as soldier for an opposing faction unless you re willing to fight imaginary enemies as a group in our example let s say that we re able to get five other people to larp with us for a total of six players to make it an even battle we ll split up into groups of three the two other players on your team might design characters who are allies of melchior for instance other knights mages or soldiers fighting for the greater good while the three you re fighting against might design characters that would logically want to fight you for instance the demons attacking our fictional kingdom if you and your friends have decided to run around pretending to be knights and wizards you may as well look the part when it comes to costumes and gear your options can be as simple or elaborate as you please the most casual larpers use their ordinary clothes and weapons made from foam wood or pvc piping while serious larp enthusiasts are known to spend thousands of dollars on lavish period accurate costumes and real or real looking weapons generally most first timers will want to stick to cheap casual options but it s up to you and your fellow larpers to decide how far you want to go in our example melchior is a knight so we ll probably want to find him a sword and armor at the very least if we re looking to stay thrifty we might want to use a broom handle or a yardstick as our sword to represent our armor we might make a breastplate out of a thin piece of foam or simply use an old shirt painted grey if we wanted to go one step further we could make a shield from a trash can lid or a circular piece of plywood and use a bike helmet to imitate a metal helm some larpers also like to replicate consumable items with actual food and drink for instance if melchior carries around a magical potion in case he s injured in battle we might want imitate this with a small flask filled with a sports drink when you ve designed a fictional world a conflict in that world and all of the characters who are participating in your larp session you re more or less ready to play all that remains is to imagine a reason for your characters to meet and interact ask yourself what do i want to do during my larp session if for instance you want to have an exciting battle you might want to invent a set of circumstances that would cause your characters to meet and engage in hostilities on the other hand if you re looking for something more cerebral you might envision a more open ended scenario such as one where the two groups of people involved are not mortal enemies or are matched in a battle of wits rather than a literal battle in our example let s say that melchior and his two companions are on a mission to scout the area for demons when they run into three such demons melchior is immediately shocked the leader of the demon band is the very one who killed his lord s son the ensuing fight practically writes itself at this point virtually every part of your larp game is set up for success the rest is up to you dive into your fictional world with no hesitation the sooner you get into character and start thinking and acting like your fictional counterpart the sooner you can start enjoying your larp experience keep an open mind stay respectful of our fellow larpers and be open to letting them influence your role playing experience most importantly have fun if don t enjoy your larp session why go through the bother of having one in the first place larp games can be serious grim affairs or casual adventures with a group of friends but regardless of the specifics of your larp game it s almost always better to have players who are committed to their roles than those who aren t larping games are essentially continuous amateur acting sessions while different players may have different levels of acting ability larp experiences are usually the most engaging when everyone tries to take the acting portion of the game seriously understandably first timers can be shy about the prospect of running around in foam armor pretending to fight monsters in the presence of other people to break the ice you may want to try doing a few basic acting exerciseswith your fellow players until everyone is feeling a little more open for instance try the classic question scene exercise have one player ask another a question to which the second player must respond with their own logical follow up question the players keep asking each other questions at a faster and faster pace until one hesitates or fails to ask a question at which point s he is replaced by another player and the scene starts over when you want to larp you typically have two choices making your own game or joining another person s if you choose the former you ll be responsible for organizing and planning the game but you ll have total freedom to do exactly what you want if on the other hand you join an established game you won t have to worry about as much but you may have to abandon your preferred characters scenarios and or rule set if your game s organizer feels strongly about these aspects of his or her game your geographical location can actually have an effect on the ease of creating or joining a larp game certain locations like large population centers may have an active larp community that organizes lots of local games while more sparsely populated areas may not have a larp community which means you may be forced to make your own game even if you d rather start by joining someone else s if this happens to you try to look on the bright side if your larp game is really good you may be able to plant the seed for the beginnings of your area s very first larp community one way to find other people s larp games is through online larp resources for instance the website larping org has a larp finding utility which allows for you to search for larping activities near your address another useful tool is larp meetup com which has information on larp groups worldwide larping is a game based on the players physical bodily actions by physically acting out your character s actions while in character you make the experience more real than if you were just to say for instance i swing my sword at you however to get into the physical aspect of your larping you ll first need a place to play this can be almost anywhere though if you can you may want to choose places that resemble the fictional setting of your scenario for added realism for instance if your adventure takes place in a forest try finding a forest clearing in a local nature preserve to larp in though every larping session is different much of the fun of a typical larp game is in the combat aspect of the game this can involve running and jumping swinging throwing and shooting fake weapons and other athletic activities thus you ll want to choose a site for your larp game where you ll have the space to safely do these things fields parks and athletic spaces gyms soccer courts etc are all great locations to use though if there are other people at these places first timers may get embarrassed if you ve played role playing games like dungeons and dragons you may already be familiar with the concept of a dm dungeon master or gm game master in the context of larping gms are participants in the game who don t pretend to be fictional characters instead they stay out of character and ensure the game stays engaging and fun by staging conflicts facilitating the gameplay of the other players and in some cases controlling the story of the larp game for large games gms may be the people who run and organize the event though this is not necessarily so in these cases gms may additionally be in charge of planning and promoting the event itself compared to gms and dms of tabletop role playing games like dungeons and dragons gms in larp scenarios generally have a looser more supportive role while tabletop gms have a great deal of control over the types of characters and situations the other players may encounter larp gms can t control the actions of real people as effectively and thus often opt to facilitate fun adventures rather than dictate them exactly the rules of player interaction and combat for larp games can be as diverse as the games settings and storylines themselves on one end of the spectrum some larp games have no rules other than staying in character in other words it s up to the players to decide many aspects of the game on the fly for instance during combat if one player is injured by another it s essentially up to him or her to decide how much so and whether or not his injury will affect his or her fighting skill on the other of the spectrum some larp games have extensive rule systems that account for every possible scenario in these cases players may for instance have a set amount of life that is drawn from every time they are injured in battle meaning that they are definitively wounded or dead after being hit a certain number of times if you re organizing your own game it s up to you to determine how extensive you want the rules to be however because larping is a group activity by its nature you ll definitely want to consult with your fellow players before making a decision note that many online larping resources offer pre made rule sets for players looking to jump right into the game for instance larping org hosts larping related blog posts some of which contain the authors preferred rules depending on the dedication of everyone involved larp games can be serious undertakings if you re organizing your own larp game you ll want to ensure that you have the best game possible by taking the time to solve logistical issues before the game itself for instance if people are traveling to your larp game from far away you may want to send directions to everyone a few days beforehand and if you plan on relaxing with the other players after the game you may want to make reservations at a local restaurant ahead of time ask yourself the following questions as you plan your larp event can all of the players easily make it to the event if not are carpools or public transit options available will there be an offsite meeting place or will all players meet at the site of the event will there be food and drink for players at the event will there be any after larp events what is the plan if there is inclement weather if you ve enjoyed your first few larp games and you d like to continue participating in them you may want to consider starting a dedicated larp group or club for your local area on the most basic level forming a larp group means that you ll be able to schedule the games that you and your friends want when you want them more importantly however it also means that you ll be able to meet new people who are also interested in larping who can in turn influence your larp activities with their own characters and ideas this is an especially good idea if your area doesn t already have an established larp community be the first person in your area to start a larp club and with luck you may be able to watch your larp community grow more than you thought possible if you re forming your own larp group you ll want to promote it to ensure that you get the best turnout possible while classified sites like craigslist etc offer one possibility for online promotion you may also want to try posting your group s information to online larping sites which welcome community submissions like larping org the biggest larp groups with the most members occasionally host enormous larp games which can have hundreds of participants or more and last for days at a time for a truly unique larp experience try participating in one of these massive larp sessions because of the scope of the game you ll be able to experience scenarios and character interactions that aren t really possible in smaller larp games for instance while an ordinary larp game between a dozen or so friends might give you the opportunity to experience fantasy combat on a small scale a larp game with hundreds of players allows you to become a soldier in a huge battle teeming with opposing forces for some participating in one of these large scale meetups represents the pinnacle of the larping experience to find one of these massive larp events which aren t necessarily everyday occurrences even among dedicated larpers you ll want to become an active member in the worldwide larp community the aforementioned larping org is a great place to start as are nerolarp com larpalliance net and other regional sites if you ve become an experienced larper and are looking for an additional challenge try designing your own rule set for larp play while this can be satisfying as a creative endeavor it s also a chance to correct any unfair or annoying aspects of the rules that you ve been using thus far if you re unsure of where to start try looking up other larpers self created rule sets online on larping org or similar larping websites as well as role playing resources like rpg net and working from there once you ve created a draft of your rule set try playing a game or two with your new rules you may find that they don t work exactly as anticipated this is ok use your experience to help you revise your rules as needed larping allows you to indulge your imagination and explore your creative capabilities to the extent that you please if you re looking for ways to express yourself creatively beyond planning typical larp sessions try expanding the fictional worlds you ve created adding detail and individual flourishes to your characters and creating fictional histories and mythologies you can go as deep as you please here some larpers may be content leaving some aspects of their fictional creations up to the imagination while others may want to account for even the smallest details your world is yours to create and explore enjoy your journey extremely detailed fictional worlds can serve as great fodder for fiction writing in fact it s not completely unheard of for novels exploring both in character and out of character larping universes to experience popularity and success if you ve given the time and effort to creating an amazing fictional universe consider writing about it you may be the next j k

example do not sacrifice a knight for a king side attack unless you are sure you can win it is not advantageous to trade a bishop worth 3 and a knight worth 3 for a rook worth 5 and a pawn worth 1 because the knight and bishop are more powerful than a rook and the pawn will not come into play until the very end of the game these values are relative in some positions a bishop or knight is stronger than a rook an exchange a knight or bishop for a rook is not worth 2 points despite its apparent value it is generally worth 1 1 1 2 points therefor 1 2 sometimes 3 pawns is enough compensation for being down an exchange pawns are overused and overextended and often the developing pieces don t get developed then your opponent will usually put a bishop through your pawn structure moving too many pawns weakens the castled king side and opens you up to attack moving too many pawns usually will weaken your endgame pawn structure there are two main ways that people play some have a strong defense and aggressive people that use this style can be incredibly deadly the other type capitalize they instantly seize hold of any mistake that their opponent makes developing quickly and leaving with an open position neither is the better although the main population are more sturdy than capitalizing it is easier to attack than to defend some like to play gambits where they sacrifice a pawn to get an attack because they find that they win a higher percentage of games go there feeling like you are going to kick butt in this series of games forget the rating forget the scores just get out there and play the best you can it is a self fulfilling prophecy find someone that is better than you and compete against them play them go to the tournaments that they do slowly get used to their playing style and use it against them and other people don t think of this rival as someone to do better than don t beat yourself up if you lose play them again and again and again do this until you have learned their style and how to counter it study play study play learn how to use their techniques and how to counter them here are a few good books the mammoth book of chess logical chess move by move by irving chernev it teaches you how to attack the king in the king pawn openings and how to play positional chess with the queen pawn openings my system by aaron nimzovitch think like a grandmaster by alexander kotov this book explains how to analyze variations so that you can play the middle game at a much higher level judgement and planning in chess by max euwe a classic book that explains how to judge a position based on space advantage combinations endgame advantages king attack and pawn structures bobby fischer teaches chess by bobby fischer a classic book that teaches chess

fine a thick book that is a classic and explains all types of endings point count chess by i a horowitz a classic book that rates 32 positional features and teaches how to convert these 32 advantages into a win how to win in the chess endings by i a horowitz this book explains endgame strategies without complex variations chess fundamentals by jose raul capablanca this book teaches the opening middle and endgame strategies end game strategy if ahead in material exchange pieces not pawns if behind in material exchange pawns and you can force a draw without pawns you must be at least a rook up to force mate the only exception to this is that two knights and a king cannot force mate against a lone king the king is a powerful piece use it to block and attack pawns bishops of opposite colors draw most of the time because neither side can advance pawns without losing them a rook pawn and bishop only draw against a black king if the bishop is the opposite color as the queening square bishops are worth more than knights in all but locked pawn positions pawns rooks and bishops become more valuable as the game proceeds so play to keep them many games with all the pawns on one side of the board end in a draw 90 of master games end in a draw where all the pawns are on one side of the board because the master with the less pawns will exchange pawns and then sacrifice a knight or bishop for the last of the pawns if you are left with just a bishop or knight you cannot force mate rook and knight or rook and bishop many times can only draw against a rook in queen endings he who moves the queen to the center first dominates play a passed pawn is not obstructed by another pawn and should be pushed nimzovitch said passed pawns must be pushed a protected passed pawn is a passed pawn that is protected by another pawn a protected passed pawn forces the opponent to constantly defend against an advance isolated pawns are weak and must be defended by a piece backward pawns on open files are extremely weak and subject to attack by rooks a king with the opposition can draw against a king with a pawn a rook on the seventh rank is worth sacrificing a pawn zugzwang is where if your opponent moves his position becomes weaker he would rather give up his turn and is common in chess rook and pawn endings are the most complicated so avoid them that will train you not to keep forgetting and relearning which pieces are attacking which squares until you look and see since your brain will be forced to memorize so much information about the state of the board anyway it won t be that much harder for it to learn to organize the information it learns about the board into a different set of pieces of information than ones that describe which piece is on which square and you will instead get slowly trained to see the whole picture notice very complex statements about the state of the board and notice patterns of which complex statements about the state of the board should be figured out to decide which move to make in fact you will eventually even become better at blindfold chess than you would have been at non blindfold chess if you had done the same amount of training using non blindfold chess though you won t be better at the current game done blind than you would be if you played that current game non blindfold and the purpose of continuing to play it blindfold is to train for future chess games don t follow step 3 all the time with no exceptions but rather judge the arrangement of pieces and decide whether it s really worth making a trade it s good to trade pieces more easily if you re ahead as shown in the following sentence if you would have a forced win if you promoted a pawn to a rook that would require losing the rook later then you will still have a forced win if you promote it to a queen and don t do what ever you can to stop it from being traded for a rook and bishop because the queen can make any move a rook can make and so could use the winning strategy that the rook would have used use your trained ability to notice patterns to try to make a move that you predict will cause your opponent to make a mistake enabling you to win the strategy can include knowledge of which person you re playing against noticing which mistakes your opponent was making earlier in the game or noticing patterns of the general type of mistake people tend to make you can find these games online easily at sites like chessgames com you should memorize the first ten moves of black and white to get a sense of how true masters begin their chess games this will help you get a sense of not just how to succeed but how to truly excel also memorizing these moves will make you more disciplined because you ll have to train your mind to absorb these moves as well as to understand what makes them so great you can use websites like chesstempo chessity or puzzle books as malcom gladwell once hypothesized working on anything for 10 000 hours will make you an expert so imagine what a pro you ll be after solving 10 000 puzzles of course this can take a very long time to achieve but if you aim to do at least one a day you will go far you can also start by setting a more realistic goal for yourself such as 1 000 puzzles and see where you go from there you can also use the world champs chess app or other apps that are geared toward chess players though practicing to be a chess master takes complete concentration having an app on your phone that relates to chess can help you train when you find yourself with some unexpected free time sign up for as many as you can and make sure you play at least once a week no matter how tired or frustrated you may be local tournaments are the way to help you practicing playing against real players and to improve your technique and strategy having a chess coach may cost a pretty penny but he can definitely help you improve at the game and to develop the discipline to be able to think outside the box you can also find a chess engine online that can help you review your moves and have a sense of what you did wrong and what you did right recognizing your flaws and your strong suits is the best way to succeed in chess remember what we said about becoming a true professional after you ve done anything for 10 000 hours though doing all of the above practice methods will certainly help in the end it s all about playing as many games as you can if you re truly committed to being a better chess player this is the path you should follow one of the best things you can do to get better at anything is to talk to someone who knows the game and is good at it it can be a relative a grandmaster or even someone who beat you

and your cells to maintain their structural integrity however too much of certain types of cholesterol exposes you to a number of health risks namely atherosclerosis which can lead to heart attacks you can lower your cholesterol levels by certain lifestyle changes and if that does not work your doctor may prescribe medications 1 lowering cholesterol through diet lowering cholesterol through lifestyle changes lowering cholesterol with medications know what cholesterol is examine your diet keep your fat intake between 25 and 35 of your daily calories use olive oil for cooking instead of butter get at least 25 to 30 grams of fiber each day eat complex carbohydrates choose fish over red meat eat avocados and nuts add whey protein to your diet eat plant sterols drink green tea eat six small meals a day exercise regularly stop smoking limit your alcohol intake lose weight ask your doctor if you should take statins get a prescription for selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors ask your doctor about resins ask your doctor about lipid lowering medications consider pcsk9 inhibitors cholesterol is an essential part of a balanced diet but too high cholesterol levels can impact your health negatively and contribute to heart disease but not all cholesterol is the same low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol also known as the bad cholesterol tends to accumulate in plaques inside the cardiac arteries contributing to heart disease high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol also known as the good cholesterol helps reduce the amount of ldl cholesterol in the body and may also contribute to a decreased risk of heart disease and stroke most of the cholesterol you need is made by your body however food products contain additional cholesterol which contributes to increased levels in your body reduce your intake of animal source foods that are high in cholesterol including red meats shellfish eggs butter cheese and milk in addition you should avoid foods that contain saturated or trans fats as these increase the levels of ldl cholesterol as well build your diet around fresh produce vegetable sources of fat and protein and high fiber foods fats are an important part of a balanced diet but you need to moderate how much you eat and what types of fats you include in your diet polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats are considered to be the good heart healthy fats while saturated and trans fats are considered unhealthy polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats help lower ldl cholesterol which is why you should eat more healthy sources of fat in order to decrease your risk of developing heart disease and stroke foods high in healthy fats include tofu fish such as salmon mackerel and river trout avocado nuts such as walnuts hazelnuts and macadamia nuts beans such as kidney beans soybeans and navy beans and vegetable oils such as olive safflower and flaxseed oil saturated fats and trans fats increase your levels of ldl cholesterol contributing to plaque development inside your arteries avoid foods that are fried and highly processed and make sure that you moderate your intake of foods that are full of unhealthy fats such as fried chicken cookies crackers and full fat dairy in addition you should limit your intake of cholesterol from food to less than 300 mg a day if your cholesterol is high the recommended amount is less than 200 mg per day butter contains saturated fats that can raise ldl cholesterol in contrast olive oil contains antioxidants that can lower your ldl cholesterol without changing your hdl cholesterol the fda recommends about 2 tablespoons or 23 grams of olive oil a day to benefit from its heart healthy benefits some research suggests that the cholesterol lowering effects of olive oil are even better if you choose extra virgin olive oil fiber is an essential part of a healthy diet that helps contribute to your heart health soluble fiber helps lower your cholesterol by binding with ldl cholesterol while it is still in your digestive system keeping it from being absorbed in your bloodstream soluble fiber can be found from a variety of sources including whole grain oatmeal beans nuts and apples insoluble fiber is also an important for your diet although it does not help lower cholesterol like soluble fiber it does add bulk to stool and promotes better digestive system health sources of insoluble fiber include wheat bran and whole grains complex carbohydrates are rich in nutrients such as vitamins minerals and fiber but they also help lower your cholesterol levels in contrast food high in simple sugars have been linked to elevated ldl cholesterol levels good sources of complex carbohydrates include oat bran legumes cabbage whole grain pasta and corn many studies have shown a link between high consumption of sugars with increased cholesterol and plasma lipid levels limit your intake of sweets and baked goods fish contain heart healthy omega 3 fatty acids that do not contribute to ldl cholesterol levels dietary guidelines recommend having at least two servings of fish each week the highest levels of omega 3 fatty acid are found in mackerel lake trout herring sardines albacore tuna and salmon red meat is high in ldl cholesterol and saturated fats when choosing beef opt for leaner cuts such as top and bottom round roast top sirloin and sirloin tip side steak or choose a white meat protein source such as turkey or chicken whenever possible to help manage your cholesterol level avocados and nuts are good vegetarian sources of monounsaturated fats that help lower ldl cholesterol levels they are also packed with other healthy nutrients such as protein vitamins and minerals however avocados and especially nuts are relatively high in calories and thus you should eat them in moderation consuming too many calories can make you overweight and being overweight puts you at higher risk for heart disease a handful of nuts and or one avocado a day are enough whey protein is derived from dairy and is shown to be effective at lowering levels of ldl cholesterol in the bloodstream whey protein is often offered in vanilla and chocolate flavors and can be added to a shake oatmeal or yogurt caution too much protein might not be good for you monitor your intake and limit your protein consumption to 15 25 of total daily calories per day or 0 8 1 2 grams per kilogram of body weight this translates to approximately 53 grams for a 140 lbs woman who does not exercise if you exercise are pregnant or breastfeeding your protein consumption is higher if you are unsure how much to take consult your doctor plant sterols help you manage your cholesterol level by blocking your body s ability to absorb it lowering ldl cholesterol levels by 6 15 without affecting the hdl cholesterol levels eating foods rich in plant sterols may be a good way to reduce your ldl cholesterol level and improve your heart health consuming sterols in recommended quantities of 2gm per day can lead to lowering ldl to that rate sterols occur naturally in grains fruits legumes vegetables nuts and seeds sterols are also added to many different kinds of foods including orange juice and yogurt a clinical study indicated that drinking green tea may help lower your cholesterol and triglyceride levels green tea also prevents your intestines from absorbing cholesterol and thus facilitates its excretion from your body green tea also has other health benefits and is thought to boost the immune system and decrease inflammation replace soda juices and other drinks with ice cold green tea flavored with lime or sugar free sweeteners a british study showed that those eating six small meals a day resulted in significantly lower cholesterol than those eating two meals a day despite the fact that those eating the six small meals actually consumed more calories and fat break your daily calories between five or six meals this will help keep you satisfied throughout the day and reduce unhealthy cravings physical inactivity is a major risk factor for heart disease regular exercise can directly impact your cholesterol by increasing the good hdl cholesterol levels it is also has an indirect impact on your cholesterol levels by helping you manage or reduce your weight the exercise guidelines recommend that adults should get at least 150 minutes of moderate activity aerobic exercise and two or more muscle strengthening exercise sessions per week 140 minutes will help you maintain your current weight 210 minutes will help reduce your weight if you don t have time to exercise regularly get up from your desk take a five minute walk every hour besides taking on a new exercise you can also increase your physical activity with simple daily practices such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator and parking your car farther away from the door it is well known that smoking has a negative impact on your lung and heart health besides reducing your risk of other health conditions quitting smoking may also impact your cholesterol by raising your hdl cholesterol level you should also do your best to stay away from secondhand smoke get support to help you quit smoking by talking to your doctor about support groups and smoking cessation treatments such as nicotine patches drinking moderate amounts of red wine may help raise your hdl cholesterol levels however drinking too much alcohol can result in dehydration and lead to chronic illnesses and addiction over time limit your alcohol consumption to one drink a day if you are a healthy female two drinks per day if you are a healthy male if you are carrying extra weight then you likely have higher ldl cholesterol levels managing your weight is key to maintaining balanced cholesterol levels you

appliance repair shops consider selling the copper for a profit know how to prepare the copper for sale to get the best price however be aware that businesses and scrap yards are now working closely with the government to catch copper thieves verify that you can legally remove copper from any site and understand the consequences if you are caught stealing sorting your copper preparing your copper

research the best prices find a scrap yard call ahead to get their prices find out if they will pick up haul your copper to the scrap yard weigh your copper unload your vehicle register your personal information get paid find specific sources of copper that are always reliable find copper wire inside old electronics search construction and remodeling sites look for copper in your home understand the consequences of copper theft scrap copper can fall into one of six different categories the different categories each have different values if you sort the copper yourself you can be sure that the scrap yard purchasing it is giving you the appropriate price otherwise they are likely to lump all of your copper into one pile and give you the lowest overall price copper solids are the the most valuable copper solids are further categorized into three grades depending on how pure they are copper non solids include dust and trimmings copper wire is generally found in electronics copper breakage is copper that has been recovered from items like motors and transformers copper alloy is copper mixed with other metals this includes brass and bronze copper solids are the most valuable kinds of copper to sell they consist of pure unalloyed copper unalloyed means that the copper is not mixed with any other kind of metal the purity of copper determines its value because any added alloys interfere with the conductive properties of the copper copper solids fall into one of three categories scrap copper number one is clean copper that is not less than 1 16 inch thick bare bright copper wire falls into this category bare bright copper wire can be distinguished from the less valuable tin coated copper wire by its reddish color all the way through some copper tubing can also fall into this category the tubing must be free of solder corrosion paint and brass fitting to be considered number one copper scrap copper number two is defined as unalloyed copper that is at least 96 percent pure copper tubing that falls into this category includes burnt copper and copper with light tin coating solder or brass fittings still attachedscrap copper number three is light copper light copper solids are any copper sheeting that is less than 1 16 inch thick roofing copper generally falls into this category it is found on roofs and gutters and it may have tar or nails still attached this category includes dust chips and turnings it is generally not very valuable and can fetch as low as 25 percent of the spot price of copper if you have access to this type of copper save it up until you get at least 10 pounds or more and then melt it down into nuggets before trying to sell it to melt copper dust turnings or scraps you will need materials specifically made for melting and casting metals the melting point of copper is 1 981 degrees fahrenheit so you need a kiln or furnace that can withstand that kind of heat a potter s kiln can get hot enough to melt copper but the oxidation process required to maintain that kind of heat will burn away a lot of the copper also it will heavily contaminate the kiln look for bronze foundry casting tools and an electric or propane furnace made specifically for melting copper and other non ferrous metals artists often melt brass and copper for sculpture and many have posted detailed tutorials for building a homemade furnace visit the foundry handbook for an example of a detailed tutorial for a diy furnace using an oxy acetylene torch for welding and a disposable helium tank or empty freon tank be aware however that the cost of powering the furnace with propane or electric will eat up about half the value of the copper therefore it might not be worth investing in this process unless you have a steady reliable source of a great deal of copper non solids exercise caution when melting metal for your safety have safety gear such as protection goggles or face shield dark welding goggles oven gloves a large flat iron pan to put the mold on and running cold water while copper wire can technically be segregated into five grades most scrap yards classify all wire as either high grade or low grade copper wire high grade wire has a single layer of insulation and low grade has a double layer the five grades of copper wire range from 85 percent to 10 percent 85 wire is a thin wire with a diameter close to that of a pencil 70 wire can generally be found inside electronics or appliances an example is romex machine wire without any attachments 50 wire is found in extension cords and appliance cords 35 wire is thinly gauged wire with many attachments this wire is generally used for communications in vga cables or telephone wires 10 wire can be found in christmas lights copper breakage is anything with copper winding transformers motors alternators and magnetrons are all examples of copper breakage disassemble parts to separate the copper from the steel in order to get the best price for the copper otherwise the scrap yard will lump the less valuable steel and copper together and you won t get as much common copper alloys are brass and bronze technically bronze is an alloy of copper and tin and brass is an alloy of copper and zinc but scrap yards lump them together and sell them at the same price they refer to them both scrap copper alloys before bringing your copper to the scrap yard first sort your copper yourself into its three different grades sort tubing and wire into their different categories this will give you an approximate idea of the overall value of your scrap copper unsorted and uncategorized lots of copper tend to sell for lower prices before purchasing an expensive wire stripper decide if you are going to be selling enough copper wire on a regular basis to make the investment worthwhile a general rule of thumb is that if you are stripping more than 1 000 pounds of wire per month then you should purchase an electric wire stripper if you are stripping less than 1 000 pounds per month you do not need to invest in a wire stripper if you decide not to buy a wire stripper warm the wire first place it in the oven on low or put it inside a black box and leave it in the sun this makes the insulation softer and easier to remove with a handheld stripping tool never under any circumstances should you burn the insulation off the wire scrap yards will not purchase dust or turnings many sellers don t even bother saving these because they are not valuable if you have these materials consider saving them until you have at least 10 pounds and then melting them down into nuggets with an electric or propane furnace made specifically for melting copper and other non ferrous metals a scrap yard may give you something for the nuggets but be prepared to accept a price of up to 75 percent below market value for copper it might not be worth the cost of the electricity or propane to run the furnace if you do decide to melt down copper dust and trimmings to sell it invest in the right materials for melting copper copper melts at a temperature of 1 981 degrees fahrenheit purchase metal casting materials that are specifically designed to withstand this kind of heat and melt copper and other non ferrous metals typically artists use these materials for casting bronze or copper sculpture you can find a furnace and other materials for melting copper at a bronze foundry or you can use an artist s tutorial such as this one to build a furnace yourself exercise caution equip yourself with safety gear such as googles face masks oven gloves and running water if using a homemade furnace carefully check all gas couplings for leaks keep all flammable materials a safe distance away from the furnace be environmentally conscious when melting metals use as much exhaust to heat the flame as possible so you are not wasting gas or electricity dispose of any waste from the process at a recycling center for hazardous materials some scrap yards will purchase transformers and motors that contain copper at a special breakage price but you should take them apart and separate the copper to get the best value when taking apart transformers don t bother trying to cut the steel because it is too hard instead cut the copper it is softer and more malleable try heating transformers in a bucket over a fire for 20 to 30 minutes after heating fill the bucket with ice water the transformers will become very weak from the sudden change in temperature and be much easier to take apart exercise safety precautions wear safety goggles to protect your eyes wear heat resistant gloves to protect your hands handle hot pieces with tongs to avoid having to touch them check commodity trading prices on nasdaq or cnbc com to find the latest price for high grade copper other trade service websites such as specialty metal sites or investment sites list the daily prices for metals including copper prices for commodities including copper are affected by market forces and change every day between 2004 and 2009 copper surged in value from approximately 1 per pound to close to 4 per pound the value dipped dramatically in 2009 during the recession to approximately 1 50 per pound but the price rebounded by 2012 to an all time high of approximately 4 50 per pound since then the price of copper has decreased as of september 2015 the price of copper per pound is about 2 43 per pound consult a website like 1 800 got scrap recycler finder or iscrap these websites let you search by location and by material you have to sell they also tell you the price the yard is offering for scrap you can also find local scrap yards by looking in the phone book or doing a search on the internet call ahead to find out the price they are offering look for a scrap yard with a good reputation for customer service some scrap yard owners may try to take advantage of you find someone whom you can trust and with whom you can see yourself doing more business if you have done your research about the current value of copper this will help you assess whether the scrap yard is offering a fair price call several scrap yards and find the one with the best price try negotiating with them if you can to get the best price if they won t offer you a fair price look elsewhere some scrap yards will come to you to pick up your scrap but they may charge you for the service compare what they are charging you with the cost of delivering it yourself which includes your time and gas decide if having it picked up is worth the price if you decide to deliver it yourself you can use whatever vehicle you choose however if you are going to be delivering lots of heavy loads consider using a sturdy pickup truck a pickup bed allows easy unloading if you haul your copper in a closed vehicle like a car or suv it might be more difficult to unload many scrap yards weigh your fully loaded vehicle when you arrive they use a large accurate pressure sensitive plate to weigh your vehicle after unloading the copper they weigh your vehicle again the difference is the weight of your scrap since copper is a non ferrous material the yard cannot use a mag crane to remove it from your truck other ferrous materials like iron and steel can be removed from truck beds by the magnet on the mag crane but since copper is not magnetic the scrap yard will likely use a forklift instead since copper theft has become such a problem the government now requires the use of security systems to try to catch copper thieves when you sell copper at a scrap yard you will likely be required to register in a database that links a photo and a description of the copper you sold with your personal information in addition your thumbprint is recorded authorities can review these records to link sellers to reported copper thefts some scrap yards may pay you with cash however if the scrap yard is participating in the government s security database system they may be prohibited from paying you in cash in this case they will likely have an automated teller machine that pays you the scrap yard will give you a slip of paper with the specified payment you can input this into the automated teller machine and it will give you your cash most people who sell scrap copper don t rely on finding it by chance they have sources on which they rely to find a steady supply of copper to sell for example you might be able to set up an agreement with an appliance repair store to pick up damaged goods you know contain copper they might be happy to allow you to recycle what would otherwise wind up in a landfill cut wires off the outside wire can be snipped off of tv s and monitors with scissors cut off the plugs from the end to add to your brass pile the small black boxes on charging cables can be cut off and put in your transformer pile search inside for insulated wires and connectors thinner insulated copper wires can be found throughout old laptops vcr s and dvd players take apart desktop computer towers to find the ribbon wire and insulated connectors in the board and hard drive large appliances are often sold for steel but don t forget to look inside for copper wiring small

ensure all the rules are followed all customs brokers must be licensed and must and must obtain a power of attorney from you while customs brokers can help you through the process you will ultimately be responsible for mistakes in the process in order to get your product into the united states properly you must work within the cbp compliance framework part of doing this involves exercising reasonable care when you make all your filings and determinations one of the most important things you can do throughout the importation process is to provide cbp with truthful complete and accurate information the information you provide throughout the process will help cbp determine the admissibility of your product classify your product and value it failure to provide accurate information may lead to your product being denied at the border and the possibility of criminal or civil charges being filed against you cbp requires throughout the entire importation process and for a period of five years after that you keep all records relating to the importation of your product and make them available to cbp if requested make copies of every piece of paper you file with cbp or other agencies and keep them in a safe place part of the importation process involves doing your due diligence before shipping your goods cbp makes this process straightforward by giving you access to information about how to comply with importation laws cbp s website posts every informed compliance publication which are there to help you evaluate requirements in various factual scenarios these publications include informative brochures as well as specific advisory opinions these publications can tell you everything from how to classify a product to how to value it you can find these materials on the cbp website before shipping a product to the united states contact a cbp officer at the port of entry where you want your product shipped you can find a list of ports as well as their contact information on the cbp website when you contact the port of entry ask to speak with an import specialist that deals with the type of product you are shipping these employees can help you make classification determinations estimate the duty rate you will pay and even answer questions abut specific filing requirements if you really want to make sure you are following the rules you can ask cbp to issue a ruling specific to your case that will give you your classification information and duty rate you may request a ruling by sending cbp a letter through the mail or electronically some products must be cleared with other federal agencies in addition to cbp before they can enter the united states for example if you are importing food for commercial use you will have to file certain paperwork with the food and drug administration fda it will then be the fda s responsibility to review your application and determine the importation eligibility of your product if you want your product accepted into the united states you must accurately declare the product s country of origin in some cases where a product is wholly manufactured in one country this process can be straightforward however when your product is a raw material or something that has been manufactured in multiple countries this determination can prove much more difficult in general your product s country of origin is the country where the product was manufactured produced or grown this country of origin determination will be used by cbp to confirm whether your product can be accepted in the united states whether the product is subject to additional tariffs and taxes and whether your product is subject to certain benefits once you know your product s country of origin the product must be marked with that information the marking on the product must be legible permanent and in english this law helps the ultimate purchaser of your product make an informed decision and avoid being misled or deceived examples of acceptable markings include product of x made in x or contents made in x if your product is repackaged or manipulated after it is imported the product s new containers must be marked with the country of origin if you fail to properly mark your product you can receive a penalty or an additional duty of 10 of the value of your product every product that is imported into the united states must have a specific tariff classification classifications are determined by using the hts the classification of your product will determine the duty rate that applies to start the classification process look through the hts to find a heading that matches the description of your product for example ferro molybdenum has a heading of 7202 once you have found your heading identifying the next two digits of your classification is straightforward the hts will have next to the heading numbers subheading numbers match the subheading numbers to your product description for example if the product you are importing is ferro molybdenum the subheading numbers are 70 therefore at this point your classification number will read 7202 70 the hts will also provide you with a two digit sub subheading which will be used to create your complete eight digit classification your final classification number will have to be provided on entry paperwork later in the process for example if you are importing ferro molybdenum your sub subheading is 00 therefore your final classification number for ferro molybdenum will be 7202 70 00 all goods imported into the united states must be valued using a particular method the value of your product will be used to calculate the duty you owe in most cases the duty rate which is determined based on your tariff classification is represented as a percentage your duty payment is calculated by multiplying the duty rate by the product s value the preferred method of valuing a product is the transaction value method to use this method you simply determine what the price paid was for the imported product when it was sold for export to the united states in addition to the price paid you must also add packing costs commissions royalties and any proceeds of a subsequent sale for example assume you paid 75 000 for a shipment of ferro molybdenum and you plan on reselling that product for a total of 100 000 additionally assume it cost you 10 000 to pack your product in this scenario the value of your product would be 110 000 75 000 25 000 10 000 if the transaction value cannot be determined you will need to use one or more alternative methods to determine your product s value if possible determine your product s value by comparing it to an identical product to do this take the transaction value of an identical product that has been previously imported for example if an identical product has a transaction value of 110 000 you can value your product at 110 000 if there is no identical merchandise available to value you can value your product using the similar merchandise method similar merchandise is merchandise that has similar components and materials and that is commercially interchangeable with your product using the deductive method the value of your product is determined by the resale price of your product after it has been imported deductions are then taken for duties and taxes among other things to use the computed method you will add up all costs and expenses incurred in producing the good if none of the specific methods can give you a value for your product cbp will work with you to use any combination of methods that will give you a reasonable value when your shipment reaches a port of entry in the united states a specific party known as the importer of record must file an entry package which will be used by cbp to evaluate your use of reasonable care the importer of record must have a meaningful legal interest in the transaction that brought your product to the united states for example the owner or purchaser of the product will almost always be able to be the importer of record additionally in some cases a person who is receiving the goods but who is not the owner or purchaser will be allowed as an importer of record however if a person has no involvement in the importation transaction other than processing entry paperwork that person will usually not be allowed to be an importer of record when your product gets to a port of entry and you have to fill out entry documents one of the things you will have to provide is a bond reference number this number will correspond to a specific import bond which is filed in order to cover potential duties taxes and fees the bond itself is a contract between you and cbp cbp promises to clear your product so long as you comply with the law and you promise to provide all required information and fees the bond itself is filed on cbp form 301 the bond amount you have to pay is an estimate of the actual amount you will owe to have your product liquidated the estimate is based on certain guidelines the cbp has established if the product you are importing is being shipped via ocean vessel you will be required to submit an isf prior to your merchandise arriving in the united states the isf must be submitted electronically visit the cbp website for the most up to date information to comply with isf requirements the following information must be filed at least 24 hours before your product is loaded onto a vessel meant to go to the united states supplier s name and addressseller s name and addressbuyer s name and addressship to name

shipping your product to the united states once you ship your product and it arrives at a port of entry you will have to work with cbp to get your product cleared a k a liquidated in order to get items entered into the united states you need to provide cbp with enough information to admit your product release your product and charge you the correct amount in duties taxes and fees to get your

query	187	choose a diet that suits you there are dozens of diets out there ranging from ones that make perfect sense and are often effective to ones that seem concocted out of thin air and are a complete joke we ll deconstruct 17 of the most popular ones talking about restriction diets restricting calories or food groups pattern diets where you change when and how you eat and crash diets where the goal is to lose a lot of weight quickly having all the knowledge necessary will equip you to decide which diet is best for you exploring restriction diets exploring dieting patterns ensuring dieting success start a low calorie diet try a low carb diet experiment with a low fat diet go vegan or vegetarian try the glycemic index diet explore the mediterranean diet go paleo go asian consider weight loss programs try intermittent fasting do calorie cycling consider the 3 hour diet experiment with the new beverly hills diet avoid crash diets do it with a buddy combine it with exercise go organic and whole grain make sure it s flexible and enjoyable see your doctor for dieting advice this is one of the simplest easiest diets to follow on a low calorie diet you simply decrease the amount of calories you re consuming the fewer you take in the quicker you lose weight the belief here is that fewer calories correlates directly to weight loss point blank that said you should never eat fewer than 1200 calories a day the pros no foods are off limits they just must be eaten in controlled portions every package by law now has to have a nutritional label and many restaurants cater to low calorie diets making going out easy the cons it involves math and constant diligence in keeping track of every food you eat and what you drink too though technology has made this easier on severely restricted diets you won t feel full and can even become nauseated or dizzy it also is hard to keep the weight off if you resume your normal caloric intake who should follow this if you re feeling determined and don t mind carrying around a pencil and paper or using an app on your phone for every meal this diet could work for you it s good for those on a strict budget and those who stay pretty busy it is not great for those who tend to snack a lot and those who want to avoid incessant tracking of their intake this diet can result in rapid weight loss though it is not for everyone with this diet your intake consists of high levels of protein and fat fat is good for you or so atkins proponents argue a low carb dieter eats plenty of meat cheeses eggs vegetables and nuts and just about nothing else the belief behind this diet is that when your body doesn t have carbs to burn it enters a state of ketosis where it goes straight to burning fat hence why fat intake is so important the pros it is fairly easy to follow and allows you to eat many delicious often fatty foods meat cheese etc that other diets restrict there is no calorie restriction so if done right you ll rarely feel hungry the cons during the initial period 2 weeks people often feel ill this is called induction flu and soon passes after which people feel more energetic and enjoy improved health and weight loss what s more plenty of foods are off limits which can be incredibly difficult to maintain it also can be easy to get bored especially if you re not a whiz in the kitchen who should follow this if you re a great cook or great with a grill this diet will be a lot easier alternatively if you don t mind eating the same things day in and day out this diet is good too if you have a raging sweet tooth and aren t much of a meat eater this diet will be very difficult to maintain and that s an understatement similar to the atkins or low carb diet is the south beach diet it restricts certain carbs and saturated fat because of its specifics it s a little less straightforward but some may find it more manageable since some carbs especially in phase two are allowed even on a low carb diet you should eat at least 20 grams 0 71 oz of carbs a day with this diet you are not focusing on calories or carbohydrates but fat low fat diets can be dangerous because there are essential fatty acids that the body requires to function the only fats that are bad for you are trans fats the belief of this diet is that fat is higher in calories than protein or carbs and therefore with restricted fat intake you re restricting your caloric intake to boot the pros it s fairly easy to maintain and involves eating a lot of fruits and vegetables low fat is listed on a lot of labels and much of it is common sense avoid sweets cakes cheese red meat etc the cons the main con of this diet is that just because a food is low fat does not mean that it s low sugar or low salt which is just as bad if not worse some fats are good for you and your body may end up craving empty carbohydrates to fill in the void who should follow this try this diet if it s easy for you to load up on fruits vegetables whole grains and lean meats naturally do not try this diet if you are a meat and cheese lover want a diligence free diet or are looking for rapid weight loss a vegetarian diet involves eating no meat a vegan diet involves eating no animal products whatsoever eggs milk etc that being said there are many varieties of vegetarianism from flexitarians who eat meat once in a great while to pescatarians who only eat fish to ovo vegetarians who do eat eggs in general this diet is low calorie low fat and full of many nutrients the pros this kind of diet can help lower cholesterol and blood pressure most vegetarians vegans load up on fruits and vegetables which are great for you there s no counting involved and sweets are not off limits to vegetarians what s more it s animal friendly the cons it has to be done right your body needs proteins that plants often just don t have even if you re vegan you re not necessarily healthy what s more it may not lead to weight loss a box of twinkies for every meal is technically vegetarian who should follow this try this diet if you don t much care for meat anyway if you re a decent cook you ll have to modify recipes for yourself to meet your dieting needs and if you aren t on a restricted budget fresh produce can be expensive avoid this diet if you re a meat eater by nature and want going out and cooking cooking for others or cooking that others do for you to be simple the glycemic index is a system that identifies which foods cause spikes in blood sugar levels and to what degree the higher the number 1 100 the worse the food is for you the gi diet avoids foods that spike your blood sugar believing that those spikes promote fat storage increase appetite and lead to weight gain the diet is comprised of mainly complex whole grain carbs and certain fruits and vegetables the pros it can reduce your chances of diabetes and stroke you still get all your food groups too you can eat whatever you want whenever you want so long as it s gi number is low the cons it s not logical for example some fruits are okay and others aren t what s more a ripe banana has a higher number than an unripened banana therefore it can be a bit hard to follow in addition your responses to foods change every day so efficacy can be hard to track who should follow this turn to this diet if you re looking for slow continual weight loss and an eating regimen that you want to maintain for a very long time do not do this diet if you re looking for fast results and want something that s easy to keep track of this diet is all about eating simple and fresh it s based on the diet of the people of southern italy and greece who eat plenty of fruits and vegetables olive oil unmodified dairy products nuts and very little red meat the people of this region display remarkable low levels of heart disease cancer diabetes and obesity just to name a few the pros it doesn t outright restrict any food group though there is little room for processed junk foods it does include complex carbs like oats a win for most people and even the occasional glass of red wine it has shown wonders for overall health and is fairly easy to maintain as long as you re conscious of your decisions the cons weight loss won t be rapid and the effects may be more internal than anything and since it s so broad it s easy to assume something is okay when it s not in addition a handful of nuts is great but a whole jar isn t you will need to keep track of your portion sizes carefully who should follow this try out this diet if you re looking to improve your overall health instead of rapid weight loss and love the idea of only eating unprocessed clean foods do not turn to this diet if you re looking for a quick fix aren t much of a cook very few frozen dinners are mediterranean friendly or are on a tight budget a recent diet trend has been the paleo diet where you only eat what ancient man had available lean meat fish fruits non starchy vegetables nuts and eggs mainly this diet totally cuts out dairy and processed foods not to mention starchy vegetables like potatoes it can greatly reduce blood sugar levels which can be wonderful for your health the pros it may lead to significant weight loss if done correctly it gets back to how humans are supposed to eat leading to you feeling healthier overall there s no counting involved either the cons did we mention no potatoes and no dairy some foods that are largely considered healthy like milk are cut what s more because such basic foods are cut it can be very difficult to eat out or have food prepared for you it can also be easy to overeat on something that s good for you but only in moderation who should follow this try this diet out if you re big on clean eating and love a challenge in the kitchen do not turn to this diet if you don t have the time or energy to learn new cooking tactics or wrestle with restaurant menus this diet is also not good for those who can t imagine life without dessert known as the mother of all modern day diets the traditional asian diet tad has a history of nearly 5 000 years and is practiced by billions of people around the world today it advocates a natural healthy and balanced diet containing fruits vegetables and whole grains with moderate amounts of eggs lean meat and fish followers of the diet also have lower risk of diabetes high cholesterol heart disease and stroke the pros it is all natural completely backed up by scientific evidence and 100 safe the diet is balanced so all your nutritional needs are met no counting is required although you certainly can if you want to the cons you need to learn to cook a few asian dishes however most of them are very easy you need to give up almost all processed food and junk food who should follow this this is the perfect diet for those who love healthy and clean eating learning about other cultures and exploring new cooking recipes in the kitchen consider jenny craig nutrisystem or other similar programs there are a plethora of dieting programs available out there that come packaged for you with meals meetings and even pamphlets for you to read to stay fired up most are low calorie though some dabble in low fat foods as well the pros everything is done for you some programs will even have meals delivered to your door if you stick to it there s no way you can mess it up in addition you ll have a network of people at your disposal to use as a support the cons you re only eating food prescribed by the program largely each one also has fees included who should follow this try out a program if you want everything pretty cut and dry with no options to make it easy and keep it simple this is also good for people that get energized by others and who would take advantage of meetings and support groups if you want to do your own cooking and want plenty of options sticking to a program is likely not the best dieting idea for you intermittent fasting or if is where you only eat during certain times of day or fast for a certain amount of hours some people go a full 24 hours without eating while others only eat say between noon and 6 pm the belief is that when your body doesn t have a meal to feast off of it goes straight to your fat stores resulting in weight loss the pros if will result in weight loss if not partly because you just eat less it s super cheap not eating 0 and results can be pretty stark especially if you re overweight or obese to begin with the cons this is very unhealthy if done wrong your body needs food to survive you will at least initially feel tired irritable and maybe even nauseated what s more it takes the willpower of a machine to stick to who should follow this if you re looking for rapid weight loss and don t mind keeping track of when you should and should not eat you may want to give this a try however if you re rather social and like to stick to a routine this diet is not for you recent science has supported the idea of calorie cycling in any given week you have a few low calorie days a couple of regular days and a high calorie day it keeps the body from knowing what to expect therefore keeping it on high gear at all times the pros no food groups are down and out restricted with this diet and there is that one day where you get to healthily binge there are no set times you just need to remember what day it is the cons you have to count your calories for starters which can be a bit of a drag you also can t take too many liberties just because it s your high calorie day does not mean you can eat 30 brownies if you want results that is who should follow this most research seems to say that this is healthy enough if done right if you want to see results just make sure you re getting plenty of fruits vegetables lean meats and whole grains every day regardless of what kind of day it is if you re diligent and interested in how the body works this could be for you but know your weaknesses this diet can be easy to abuse and does take effort in counting calories and staying on plan this is a diet that says you should eat every 3 hours to keep your metabolism up if you don t your body automatically reaches starvation mode you eat light meals regularly and then 100 calorie snacks in between however you don t eat 3 hours before bed there are pre prepared meals you can buy on this plan if you re interested the pros you can eat anything even fried chicken if you control your portion sizes it also keeps you feeling full since you re eating all day it also encourages a healthy balance of all the food groups the cons this diet is easy to do wrong the freedom makes it easy to abuse in addition there s not a ton of science to back up the idea that eating often is what you should do who should follow this try this diet out if you re looking for an interesting twist on dieting and find yourself snacking away anyway do not try this diet if you re looking for surefire weight loss or are lacking in the willpower department the idea behind this diet is that it s not about what foods you eat it s about when you eat them and what you eat them with the right combination leads to better digestion and your body getting rid of it instead of turning it to fat it claims that you ll see up to a 15 pound weight loss during the diet s 35 day initiation phase the pros there s no calorie or food group restriction and no portion control believe it or not you don t have to count a thing except for the time it also encourages fruits and vegetables which are good for the body the cons well for starter it s not scientifically backed up and in the beginning it requires only eating fruit while fruit is a healthy part of a balanced diet it is not health to only eat fruit the rules are a little convoluted and difficult to follow only eat protein once you ve eaten protein once you eat a type of fruit be done with it and switch to a different type of fruit etc who should follow this try this diet if you re not into portion control or food restriction there is a book tapes and meal plans you can purchase for a fee if you re willing to spend money do not try this diet if you re not diligent and serious this diet is easy to not lose weight on crash diets are extreme diets that promise to help you lose weight quickly but the problem is that they rarely work often they force you to starve yourself which can be dangerous to your health when dieting try to avoid trendy crash diets such as cleansesjuice dietssoup diets such as the cabbage soup diet or chicken soup dietliquid dietgrapefruit diet regardless of whatever type of diet you re doing do it with a friend if you can this goes double for any diet that is hard to stick to having someone is to keep you strong and hold you accountable may be just what you need to make it through this is why the programs like weight watchers are useful but you often don t need a verified program to find support talk to your friends and family because they may be going through the same thing almost any diet will be complemented by exercise be it aerobic weight training or both both is generally best whether it s a walk in the park or a 4 mile run it s a good idea and your weight loss results will be even more noticeable making the plan easier to stick to do at least 150 minutes of exercise a week for good health if you want to lose weight you should do at least 300 minutes a week this only should be avoided if your caloric restriction is severe if you exercise on a perpetually empty stomach there could be health implications again regardless of the diet you re on if you re eating food choose organic when you can and whole grain when you can the fewer processes your food has gone through the more intact the nutrients are this is where dieting can get expensive to make it cheaper buy in bulk and shop at farmer s markets when you can host pot lucks too with friends who are also conscious of their eating no diet will stick if it s not two things flexible there will be days when you decide to be social and go out to restaurants there will be days when you have nothing to eat in the house but ramen noodles there will be days when you just don t feel up to it a diet that s flexible where you don t blame yourself if you mess up is the easiest to stick to enjoyable it doesn t take a rocket scientist to realize that only drinking lemon maple water for a week isn t fun if it were it d be easier to stick to make sure whatever kind of diet you choose has some foods that you enjoy love meat try the atkins diet can t get enough olive oil go mediterranean you have options the only person who knows your body almost as well as you do and has an opinion you should trust is your doctor before you start any serious dieting regimen it s important to consult him or her for advice every body is different and some diets may not be suitable for yours this goes double if you re pregnant a growing teen a senior citizen or if you have any health issues at all the last thing you want is your diet to cause more health implications talk to your doctor about a couple of diets you re considering he or she may have an even better idea ask for a referral to a registered dietitian who can help you come up with the right diet for your lifestyle and weight loss goals

you may have diabetes do not wait on seeing a doctor it is highly recommended that you see a doctor you re here so you are in the right mindset diabetes educators are highly recommended these experts help you understand the different tools available to you and can help you adjust your meals to better control blood glucose levels for those who are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at a young age an appointment with a diabetes trainer educator is often mandatory and they will often meet with you while in the hospital the body of a person with type 1 diabetes needs insulin because their pancreas is damaged in a way that will not produce enough insulin as needed insulin is a chemical compound used to break down sugar glucose in the bloodstream those with type 1 diabetes must work with their doctor to find their correct dosage of insulin because different individuals have different reactions to various types of insulin and because some individuals with this type of diabetes may still be producing insulin at mild levels without insulin the symptoms of type 1 diabetes will rapidly worsen and eventually cause death to be clear individuals with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day or they will die your precise daily insulin dosages will vary based on your size diet activity level and genetics which is why it is so important to see a doctor to get a thorough evaluation before beginning your diabetes treatment plan insulin is generally available in several different varieties each of which is formulated for specific purposes these are rapid acting mealtime bolus insulin usually taken right before a meal to prevent elevated blood glucose levels after eating short acting basal insulin usually taken between meals once or twice a day to control resting blood glucose levels long acting a combination of bolus and basal insulin can be be taken before breakfast and dinner in order to keep blood glucose levels low after meals as well as throughout the day intermediate acting combined with rapid acting insulin it covers the blood glucose elevations when rapid acting insulins stop working this type is typically taken twice a day your blood glucose level is entered into the device at meal times and in accordance with your normal testing schedule and your bolus is calculated for you in addition a carbohydrate ratio can be set and be added to the bolus calculation as well there is the new tubeless insulin pump that is an all in one unit that typically come loaded with a three day supply of insulin with the battery and pump built in it is the omnipod that is wirelessly controlled by a personal diabetes manager pdm it takes ideally requires about ten pumps per month that come in a box holding a 30 day supply the old standard injection set consisted of a plastic cap attached to a catheter that injects the insulin subcutaneous delivery of insulin it was inserted into your chosen injection site brought from the pump by tubing called the cannula the pump set might be attached to a belt or near the delivery site with an adhesive pad on the other end the tubing connects to a cartridge that you fill with insulin and insert into the pump unit some pumps have a compatible glucose monitor that measures glucose levels just below the dermis while not as effective as a glucose meter this device will allow early detection and compensation for sugar spikes and drops pump users typically monitor their blood sugars more frequently to evaluate the effectiveness of insulin delivery by the pump to be aware if the pump malfunctions some malfunctions of the insulin pump include pump battery is dischargedinsulin is inactivated by heat exposureinsulin reservoir runs emptytubing loosens and insulin leaks rather than being injectedthe cannula becomes bent or kinked preventing delivery of insulin in general people with diabetes should strive to be physically fit physical exercise has the effect of lowering the body s glucose levels sometimes for as long as 24 hours because the most harmful effects of diabetes are caused by elevated glucose levels blood sugar spikes exercise after eating is a valuable tool that uses sugar naturally and allows people with diabetes to keep glucose at manageable levels in addition exercise also provides the same benefits to those with diabetes that it does to those without it namely greater overall fitness weight loss but rapid weight loss is a bad symptom indicating food and sugar is not used properly by your system you can gain higher strength and endurance higher energy levels elevated mood and more benefits of exercise as well diabetes resources generally recommend exercising at least several times per week most resources recommend a healthy mix of cardio strength training and balance flexibility exercises see how to exercise for more information though low manageable glucose levels are generally a good thing for moderate activity for people who have diabetes exercising vigorously while you have low blood sugar levels can lead to a condition called hypoglycemia in which the body doesn t have enough blood sugar to fuel its vital processes and the exercising muscles hypoglycemia can lead to dizziness weakness and fainting to counter hypoglycemia carry a sugary quick acting carbohydrate with you while you exercise such as a sweet ripe orange or a soda a sports drink or such as recommended by your health team whether the cause is physical or mental stress is known to cause blood sugar levels to fluctuate constant or prolonged stress can cause blood sugar levels to rise in the long term which means you may need to use more medication or exercise more frequently to stay healthy generally the best cure for stress is a preventative one avoid stress in the first place by exercising frequently getting enough sleep avoiding stressful situations when possible and talking about your problems before they become serious other stress management techniques include seeing a therapist practicing meditation techniques eliminating caffeine from your diet and pursuing healthy hobbies see how to deal with stress for more information as both an actual physical ailment and as an indirect source of stress illness can cause your blood sugars to fluctuate prolonged or serious illness can even necessitate changes in the way you take your diabetes medication or the diet and exercise routines you ll need to keep though the best policy when it comes to illnesses is to avoid them by living a life that is as healthy happy and stress free as possible if and when you do come down with an illness be sure to give yourself the rest and medicine that you need to get better as quickly as possible if you have the common cold try drinking plenty of fluids taking over the counter cold medications but avoid sugary cough syrups and getting plenty of rest since having the cold can ruin your appetite you ll want to be sure to eat roughly 15 grams of carbohydrates every hour or so though having a cold usually elevates your blood sugar levels refraining from eating as may feel natural can cause your blood sugar to fall dangerously low serious illnesses always require the advice of a doctor but managing serious diseases in patients with diabetes can require special medicines and techniques if you are a person with diabetes and you think you may have a disease that is more serious than an ordinary cold see your doctor right away women with diabetes have unique challenges when it comes to managing blood sugar during their periods and menopause though diabetes affects every woman differently many women report having elevated blood sugar levels in the days before their periods which can require using more insulin or changing your diet and exercise habits to compensate however your blood sugar levels during your menstrual cycle may be different so talk to your doctor or gynecologist for specific guidance additionally menopause can change the way that the body s blood sugar level fluctuates many women report that their glucose levels become more unpredictable during menopause menopause can also lead to weight gain sleep loss and temporary vaginal ailments which can increase the body s levels of stress hormones and elevate glucose levels if you have diabetes and are going through menopause talk to your doctor to find a treatment plan that s right for you right after you are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes it is likely that you will need to meet with your doctor regularly as much as once a week or more to get a sense for how to best control your blood glucose levels it can take a few weeks to develop an insulin therapy regimen that perfectly matches your diet and activity level once your diabetes treatment routine is established you won t need to meet with your doctor quite as often however you should plan on maintaining a good relationship with your doctor which means scheduling semi regular follow up appointments your doctor is the person who is best suited to detecting discrepancies in your blood glucose levels before they become serious and are valuable resources when you need to manage your diabetes during times of stress sickness pregnancy and so on those with type 1 diabetes should expect to see their doctor once every 3 6 months once a routine is established if you have type 2 diabetes your body is able to produce some insulin as opposed to none at all but has a diminished capacity for producing insulin or is not able to use the chemical correctly because of this crucial difference type 2 diabetes symptoms can be more mild than type 1 symptoms and have a more gradual onset and can require less drastic treatments though exceptions are possible however as with type 1 diabetes seeing your doctor before beginning any treatment plan is still essential only a qualified medical professional has the knowledge definitively diagnose your diabetes and design a treatment plan that s tailored to your personal needs as noted above people with type 2 diabetes have a diminished but not nonexistent capacity to make and use insulin naturally because their bodies do make some insulin in some cases it s possible for people with type 2 diabetes to manage their disease without having to use any artificial insulin usually this is done through careful diet and exercise which means minimizing the amount of sugary foods consumed maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly some people with mild cases of type 2 diabetes can potentially live basically normal lives if they are very careful about what they eat and how much they exercise it s important to remember however that some cases of type 2 diabetes are more severe than others and can t be managed with diet and exercise alone and can require insulin or other medications note see the sections below for information relating to diet and medications type 2 diabetes is known to be a progressive disease this means that it can get worse over time this is thought to be because the body s cells responsible for producing insulin get worn out from having to work extra hard in people with type 2 diabetes as a result cases of type 2 diabetes that once required relatively minor treatment options can eventually require more drastic treatments including insulin therapy after several years this is often not due to any fault on the patient s behalf as with type 1 diabetes you should keep in close contact with your physician if you have type 2 diabetes regular tests and checkups can help you detect the progression of type 2 diabetes before it becomes serious obesity is one of the leading causes of type 2 diabetes however being obese can make any case of diabetes more dangerous and harder to manage the added stress that obesity puts on the body can make it extremely difficult to keep blood sugar at healthy levels in type 2 diabetes cases where patients have high body mass indexes usually greater than 35 doctors will sometimes recommend weight reduction surgeries to bring the patient s weight under control quickly two types of surgery are usually used for this purpose gastric bypass surgery the stomach is shrunk to the size of a thumb and the small intestine is shortened so that fewer calories are absorbed from food this change is permanent laparoscopic gastric banding lap banding a band is wrapped around the stomach so that it feels fuller with less food this band can be adjusted or removed if needed because the potentially harmful effects of diabetes are triggered by elevated blood sugar levels it s important for people with diabetes to check their blood sugar levels fairly regularly today this is usually done with a small portable machine that measures your blood sugar from a tiny drop of your blood the exact answers to when where and how you should check your blood sugar can depend on your age the type of diabetes you have and your condition thus you ll want to talk to your doctor before beginning to monitor your blood sugar levels the advice below is for general cases and is not meant to replace the advice of a doctor those with type 1 diabetes are often instructed to check their blood sugar three or more times a day this is often done before or after certain meals before or after exercise before bed and even during the night if you are sick or are taking a new medication you may need to monitor your blood sugar even more closely those with type 2 diabetes on the other hand usually don t have to check their blood sugar quite as often they may be instructed to check their levels once or more per day in cases where type 2 diabetes can be managed with non insulin medications or diet and exercise alone your doctor may not even require you to check your blood sugar every day just as it is important for people with diabetes to monitor their blood sugar from day to day it s also important to have a bird s eye perspective of long term trends in blood sugar levels people with diabetes should generally have special test called a1c also known as hemoglobin a1c or hba1c tests at regular intervals your doctor may direct you to have such tests every month or every two to three months these tests monitor the average blood sugar level over the last few months rather than giving an instantaneous snapshot and thus can provide valuable information about whether or not a treatment plan is working well a1c tests work by analyzing a molecule in your blood called hemoglobin when glucose enters your blood some of it binds to these hemoglobin molecules because hemoglobin molecules usually live for about 3 months analyzing the percentage of hemoglobin molecules that are bound to glucose can paint a picture of how high blood sugar levels were over the past few months if your body lacks insulin and can t break down the glucose in the blood its organs and tissues will quickly become starved for energy this can lead to a dangerous condition called ketoacidosis in which the body begins to break down its fat stores to fuel its important processes though this will keep your body functioning this process produces toxic compounds called ketones which if allowed to build up can be potentially life threatening if you have a blood sugar reading over 240 mg dl or exhibit the symptoms listed below test for ketoacidosis every 4 6 hours this can be done with a simple over the counter urine strip test if your test reveals you have a high amount of ketones in your urine call your doctor immediately and seek emergency treatment the symptoms of ketoacidosis are nauseavomitingsweet smelling fruity breath odorunexplained weight loss because type 2 diabetes can progress so gradually that it s difficult to detect it s important to be on the lookout for possible complications from the disease so that they can be addressed before becoming serious diabetes can cause nerve damage and change circulation to certain parts of the body especially the feet and eyes over time this can result in loss of the feet or blindness people with type 1 and people with type 2 diabetes are both at risk for these complications however because type 2 diabetes can progress gradually without being noticed it s extra important to schedule regular foot and eye exams to prevent either condition from developing comprehensive dilated eye exams check for diabetic retinopathy vision loss from diabetes and should normally be scheduled about once a year during pregnancy or illness more frequent is likely to be necessary foot tests check for pulse feeling and the presence of any sores or ulcers on the feet and should be scheduled about once per year however if you have had foot ulcers before having tests as often as once every 3 months may be necessary when it comes to controlling your diabetes diet is crucial carefully managing the types and amounts of foods you eat allows you to manage your blood sugar level which has a direct effect on the severity of your diabetes the advice in this section comes from reputable diabetes resources but every diabetes plan should be individually tailored for you based on your age size activity level condition and genetics thus the advice in this section is intended only as a general advice and should never replace the advice of a qualified doctor or nutritionist if you are unsure of how to obtain personalized diet information talk to your doctor or general practitioner s he will be able to guide your diet plan or refer you to a qualified specialist when someone eats more calories than s he burns the body responds by creating an increase in blood sugar since the symptoms of diabetes are caused by elevated blood sugar levels this is undesirable for people suffering from diabetes thus people with diabetes are generally encouraged to eat diets which provide as many essential nutrients as possible while keeping the total calories consumed per day at a sufficiently low level thus foods like many types of vegetables which are nutrient dense and low calorie can make up a good portion of a healthy diabetes diet low calorie high nutrient diets are also helpful for diabetes because they ensure you remain at a healthy weight obesity is known to strongly contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes in recent years a lot of the health dangers posed by carbohydrates have been brought to light most diabetes resources recommend eating controlled amounts of carbohydrates specifically healthy and nutritious varieties of carbohydrates generally individuals with diabetes will want to limit their intake of carbohydrates to moderately low levels and to make sure that the carbohydrates they do eat are whole grain high fiber carbohydrates see below for more information many carbohydrates are grain products which are derived from wheat oat rice barley and similar grains grain products can be divided into two categories whole grains and refined grains whole grains contain the entire grain including the nutrient rich outer portions called the bran and germ while refined grains only contain the innermost starchy portion called the endosperm which is less nutrient rich for a given calorie amount whole grains are much more nutrient rich than refined grains so try to prioritize whole grain products over white breads pastas rice and so on bread has been shown to raise a person s blood sugar more than two tablespoons of table sugar fiber is a nutrient contained in vegetables fruits and other plant derived foods fiber is largely indigestible when it s eaten most fiber passes through the intestine without being digested though fiber doesn t provide much nutrition it does provide a variety of health benefits for instance it helps control feelings of hunger making it easier to eat healthy amounts of food it also contributes to digestive health and is famously known to help keep you regular high fiber foods are a great choice for people with diabetes because they make it easier to eat a healthy amount of food each day high fiber foods include most fruits especially raspberries pears and apples whole grains bran legumes especially beans and lentils vegetables especially artichokes broccoli and green beans protein is often rightly lauded as a healthy source of energy and muscle building nutrition but some sources of protein can come loaded with fat for a smarter option choose low fat high nutrient lean protein sources in addition to supplying the nutrition needed for a strong healthy body protein is also known to produce a greater longer lasting feeling of fullness than other sources of calories lean proteins include skinless white meat chicken dark meat has a little more fat while the skin is high fat most fish dairy products full fat is better than low fat or fat free beans eggs pork tenderloin and lean varieties of red meat contrary to popular belief dietary fat isn t always a bad thing in fact certain types of fat namely mono and polyunsaturated fats which include omega 3 s are known to provide health benefits including lowering the body s level of ldl or bad cholesterol however all fats are calorie dense so you ll want to enjoy fats sparingly to maintain a healthy weight try to add small servings of good fats into your diet without increasing your overall calorie load per day your doctor or dietician will be able to help you here foods that are rich in good fats mono and polyunsaturated fats include avocados most nuts including almonds pecans cashews and peanuts fish tofu flaxseed and more on the other hand foods that are rich in bad fats saturated and trans fats include fatty meats including regular beef or ground beef bacon sausage etc fatty dairy products including cream ice cream full fat milk cheese butter etc chocolate lard coconut oil poultry skins processed snack foods and fried foods cholesterol is a lipid a type of fat molecule that is naturally produced by the body in order to serve as an important part of cell membranes though the body naturally requires a certain amount of cholesterol elevated levels of blood cholesterol can lead to health problems especially for people with diabetes high cholesterol levels can lead to a variety of serious cardiovascular problems including heart disease and stroke people with diabetes are naturally predisposed to having cholesterol levels that are unhealthy so it s extra important for diabetes sufferers to monitor their cholesterol intake than for people without the disease this means choosing foods carefully to limit the intake of cholesterol cholesterol comes in two forms ldl or bad cholesterol and hdl or good cholesterol bad cholesterol can build up on the inner walls of the arteries causing eventual problems heart attack and stroke while good cholesterol helps remove damaging cholesterol from the blood thus people with diabetes will want to keep their level of bad cholesterol intake as low as possible while eating healthy amounts of good cholesterol bad cholesterol sources include fatty dairy products egg yolks liver and other types of organ meat fatty meats and poultry skin good cholesterol sources include oatmeal nuts most fish olive oil and foods with plant sterols alcohol is often called a source of empty calories and for good reason alcoholic beverages like beer wine and liquor contain calories but little in the way of actual nutrition luckily most people with diabetes can still enjoy these entertaining if not nutritious drinks in moderation according to the american diabetes association moderate alcohol use actually has little effect on blood glucose control and does not contribute to heart disease thus people with diabetes are generally encouraged to follow the same guidelines as people without diabetes when it comes alcohol men can enjoy up to 2 drinks daily while women can have 1 drink note that for medical purposes drinks are defined as standard size servings of the beverage in question about 12 ounces of beer 5 ounces of wine or 1 1 2 ounces of liquor note also that these guidelines do not account for sugary mixers and additives which may be added to cocktails and can negatively impact the blood glucose level of someone with diabetes one of the most frustrating things about any diet including a diabetes diet is that eating too much of any food even healthy nutritious food can cause weight gain which leads to health problems because it s important for people with diabetes to keep their weight at a healthy level portion control is a serious concern generally for a large meal like dinner those with diabetes will want to eat plenty of nutritious fiber rich vegetables along with controlled amounts of lean protein and starchy grains or carbohydrates many diabetes resources offer sample meal guides to help teach the importance of portion control most of such guides offer advice that strongly resemble the following devote 1 2 of your plate to non starchy fiber rich vegetables like kale spinach broccoli green beans bok choy onion pepper turnip tomatoes cauliflower and many more devote 1 4 of your plate to healthy starches and grains like whole grain breads oatmeal rice pasta potatoes beans peas grits squash and popcorn devote 1 4 of your plate to lean protein like skinless chicken or turkey fish seafood lean beef or pork tofu and eggs diabetes is a serious illness which can require special medications to treat however if misused these medications can lead to problems which can be serious in their own right before taking any medication for your diabetes talk to your doctor to develop a plan that takes all treatment options including diet and exercise into account like all serious medical conditions a case of diabetes requires the advice of a qualified professional the information in this section is purely informative and should not be used to pick medications or formulate dosages additionally you won t necessarily want to stop taking any medications you are currently on if you discover you are have diabetes a doctor must evaluate all of the variables at play including your current medication usage to develop a plan to treat your diabetes the effects of using too much or too little diabetes medication can be serious for instance an overdose of insulin can result in hypoglycemia leading to dizziness fatigue confusion and even coma in severe cases insulin is perhaps the most well known diabetes medication the insulin that doctors prescribe to people who have diabetes is a synthetic form of a chemical naturally produced by the pancreas to process sugar in the blood in healthy individuals after a meal when blood sugar levels are high the body releases insulin to break down the sugar removing it from the bloodstream and rendering it into a usable form of energy administering insulin via injection allows the body to process blood sugar properly since medicinal insulin comes in several strengths and varieties it s important to receive a doctor s advice before starting to use insulin note that people with type 1 diabetes must take insulin type 1 diabetes is characterized by the body being completely unable to make insulin so it must be added by the patient people with type 2 diabetes may or may not take insulin depending upon the severity of their disease there are a variety of options when it comes to orally administered diabetes medications pills often for people with moderate cases of type 2 diabetes doctors will recommend trying these types of medications before using insulin as the latter represents a more drastic life affecting treatment option because there are are such a wide variety of oral diabetes medications with different mechanisms of action it s important to talk to a doctor before starting to take any sort of diabetes pills to ensure that the medication is safe for your own personal use see below for the different types of oral diabetes medications and a brief description of the mechanism of action for each sulfonylureas stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin biguanides lower the amount of glucose produced in the liver and makes muscle tissue more sensitive to insulin meglitinides stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin thiazolidinediones reduce glucose production in liver and increase insulin sensitivity in muscle and fat tissue dpp 4 inhibitors prevent the breakdown of normally short lived chemical mechanisms which regulate the level of blood glucose sglt2 inhibitors absorbs blood glucose in the kidneys alpha glucosidase inhibitors lower glucose levels by preventing the breakdown of starches in the intestine also slow the breakdown of some sugars bile acid sequestrants reduces cholesterol and simultaneously lowers glucose levels the method for the latter is still not well understood the medications specifically designed to fight diabetes above are not the only medications prescribed for diabetes doctors prescribe a range of medications from aspirin to flu shots to help manage diabetes however even though these medications are usually not as serious or drastic as the diabetes medications described above it s usually a good idea to consult with your doctor before supplementing your treatment plan with one of these medicines just in case just a few supplementary medicines are listed below aspirin sometimes prescribed to reduce the risk of heart attacks for people with diabetes mechanism of action is not well understood but is thought to relate to aspirin s ability to prevent red blood cells from sticking together flu shots since the flu like many illnesses can cause blood glucose levels to fluctuate and make diabetes harder to manage doctors often recommend that patients receive yearly flu shots to reduce their chance of contracting this disease herbal supplements though most homeopathic supplements have not definitively been proven effective in a scientific setting some diabetes patients offer anecdotal testimonies to their effectiveness 
query	189	install a toggle switch a toggle switch is an electrical component that controls the flow of electricity through a circuit by means of a mechanical lever that is manually controlled though toggle switches come in several varieties in their simplest form they re essentially on off switches for whatever circuit they re wired to usually toggle switches are installed in devices that lack a pre existing means for regulating an add on s operation for example a person might install a toggle switch in his or her car to operate an aftermarket interior led light system see step 1 below to get started installing your own toggle switch installing your switch in your device s paneling connecting your toggle switch to your device s wiring purchasing the right switch for your device disconnect all power from the device before beginning remove the panel or housing from the device measure the diameter of the switch bushing that will protrude through the panel drill or cut a hole through the panel to fit your hole install the switch from the underside of the panel always defer to the instructions provided with your switch or your device cut the supply wire in your device if either end of the wire does not reach the switch add a pigtail connect the supply wire to the toggle switch test your switch select a switch with the appropriate number of poles and throws for your purpose select a switch rated above the maximum current in amps that will flow through the switch select a switch with the right type of electrical connections for your project select a suitable mount as with nearly all types of electrical work it s extremely important to ensure that there s no risk of electric shock before starting work on your device attempting to modify a live device is an easy way to seriously hurt yourself or cause a short circuit and permanently damage your device the precise method for disconnecting your device from its power source differs depending on the device you re working on for cars you ll want to disconnect the negative terminal of the battery for instance while other devices may require you to yank a plug or manually disconnect the power supply in some other way installing a toggle switch on a device requires you to gain access to the device s internal wiring which usually means removing the device s exterior paneling or housing if possible rather than removing the paneling for the entire object try to remove only the paneling from the part of the device where you intend to install the switch for instance if you re installing a toggle switch in your car you ll want to remove the dash paneling if possible a small portion of paneling where you want to install the switch rather than the entire dash panel this may require screwdrivers pry bars panel poppers or other specialized tools to accommodate your toggle switch you ll usually need to create a suitably sized and shaped hole in the paneling or housing of your device for basic toggle switches this is usually a circular hole but depending on the type of switch you re using differently shaped holes may be necessary measure the dimensions of your switch bushing the part of the switch in which the lever is seated so that you ll know how large to make your hole next make a hole in the paneling of your device to fit your switch for the most basic toggle switches with circular bushings this will mean drilling with a bit slightly larger that the diameter of the switch bushing for differently shaped holes you may need to use a jigsaw sandpaper and or other tools use a hss high speed steel twist drill bit to drill through wood plastic or mild steel a spade bit may also be used if you are drilling through wood finally put your switch in the hole you ve just carved for it passing through from the underside secure the toggle switch in place with its mount this usually means installing the mount over the hole passing the toggle switch through and tightening it in place with a nut for example in a basic toggle switch setup you might have to thread a jam nut onto the switch s bushing to fasten it to the panel mount then tighten the nut with an adjustable wrench the types of devices onto which you might want to install a toggle switch will have electrical configurations that vary greatly thus no single guide is likely to provide a one size fits all solution the steps in this section are meant to be taken as general guidelines for a simple on off spst toggle switch they should never supersede any instructions included with your toggle switch or the device into which you re installing it when in doubt consult a skilled electrician to save time and avoid inadvertent damage for your toggle switch to function as an on off switch you ll need to wire your toggle switch to the device s power supply use wire cutters to cut your device s supply wire in a location that best allows for routing either or both ends of the wire to the switch strip approximately 1 2 inch 1 3 cm of insulation from each end of the wire using a wire stripper a pigtail is a short length of wire usually about 6 with both ends stripped it can be connected to wires to that aren t quite long enough to reach your toggle switch as a sort of extender add a pigtail as follows determine the gauge of the existing wire and obtain black wire of the same gauge cut a piece of black wire long enough to reach from the cut end of the supply wire to the toggle switch strip 1 2 inch 1 3 cm of insulation from each end of this piece of wire connect one end of the pigtail wire to the supply wire by twisting the ends of the wires together clockwise twist a wire nut of the proper size clockwise over the wire joint until the wire nut is tight at this point you ve a made a break in the device s supply wire you ll need to add your toggle switch in the middle of the break so that it can regulate the flow of electricity through the circuit the way you do this depends on the type of toggle switch you have see below if your toggle switch has wire leads twist the end of each lead to one of the supply wires or pigtail extensions and twist a wire nut over each wire connection until they re tight if your toggle switch has screw terminals loosen the terminal screws loop the ends of the supply wires and hook each loop over a terminal screw so the loops point clockwise around the shaft of each terminal screw then tighten the terminal screws if the toggle switch has solder connections bend the ends of the wires around the switch terminals needle nose pliers may be useful heat each terminal with a soldering iron while holding the end of solder wire in contact with the terminal but not in direct contact with the soldering iron tip when the solder begins to melt withdraw the soldering iron tip and allow the melting solder to flow and cover the wire terminal joint when your toggle switch is wired properly carefully re connect the device s power supply and test the function of the toggle switch if it works as intended you may replace the panel or device housing congratulations you ve successfully installed a toggle switch in electrical terminology a toggle switch can have one or more poles and throws pole refers to the number of circuits controlled by the switch usually this is the number of outwardly visible levers on the switch throw refers to the number of positions a switch has usually for simple on off capability you ll want a spst single pole single throw switch however if the device you re attaching your toggle switch needs more than basic on off control you may need a more complicated switch for instance if you re installing a toggle switch to control a car s hydraulic system you ll probably want a switch with multiple poles to control the hydraulics for the different sides of your car and or multiple throws so that you ll be able to set the hydraulics to off or varying degrees of on rather than just simply off or on note that there are differences between british and american terminology when it comes the colloquial names for common switches in the states a spst switch is also called a two way switch whereas in britain it s called a one way switch similarly in the us and britain a spdt single pole double throw switch is called a three way and two way switch respectively different electrical devices require different amounts of current to power them when searching for switches make sure the contact rating of the switch you select is equal to or greater than the circuit current you plan for it to regulate your toggle switch is useless if it can t connect to the device it s supposed to operate be sure to pick a switch that s compatible with the electrical connections inside your device if you don t you may find yourself having to make improvised connections with a soldering iron electrical tape etc which can be daunting for the inexperienced common types of switch connections include screw connectors solder lugs pins or terminals wire leads if your device comes with spaces specifically designed to accommodate toggle switches you may be able to get away without having to make any extraneous modifications to your device however the types of devices in which toggle switches are often installed usually don t thus you should usually expect to need to drill a hole for the switch and to install a mount to seat the switch in often you ll need a type of mount called a panel mount that interfaces with a type of switch called a panel switch a panel mount switch has a threaded body that protrudes up through a hole in a panel and is secured to the panel with a panel or jam nut 
query	190	get rid of fordyce spots fordyce spots or granules are small raised pale red or white bumps that may appear on the labia scrotum shaft of the penis or on the border of your lips essentially they are visible sebaceous glands which normally secrete oils for the hair and skin 1 they commonly appear during puberty and are harmless they are not infectious and not considered an std sexually transmitted disease like herpes and genital warts are no treatment is typically required although getting rid of them for cosmetic reasons is common laser and other surgical treatments are the most effective medical treatments getting rid of fordyce spots differentiating fordyce spots from other conditions consult with a dermatologist ask about the available laser treatments consider micro punch treatments instead think about using topical prescription creams ask about photodynamic therapy photodynamic therapy is a light activated treatment look into isotretinoin isotretinoin can take several months but it can give long lasting results for fordyce spots ask about cryotherapy find out about electrodessication cauterization practice good hygiene don t confuse fordyce spots with herpes differentiate fordyce spots from genital warts don t mistake fordyce spots for folliculitis if you notice little bumps on your genitals or around the borders of your lips that aren t going away or are bothering you get a referral from your family doctor to a dermatologist who are skin specialists the dermatologist will be able to diagnose your condition and put your mind at ease because fordyce spots can sometimes look like small warts or the initial stages of a herpes outbreak fordyce spots are a very common phenomenon and appear in about 85 of the population at some time in their lives males are a little more likely to develop them than females are it s important to realize that fordyce spots are harmless painless not infectious and do not require treatment their removal should be for cosmetic reasons only fordyce spots are much more noticeable when the skin is stretched and may only be seen during an erection in males or during pubic hair management bikini wax for females if you decide to remove some fordyce spots for cosmetic reasons talk to your dermatologist about available laser treatments which are the most common method of getting rid of them and certain other skin conditions vaporizing laser treatments such as carbon dioxide co2 lasers have been used with some success on fordyce spots but so have pulsed dye lasers ask your doctor which may be most appropriate for your condition and budget co2 lasers were the earliest gas lasers developed and remains the highest power continuous wave laser treatment currently available for various skin conditions however co2 laser ablation can leave scars afterwards so it may not be appropriate for fordyce spots on the face in contrast treatment with pulsed dye lasers is more expensive than co2 lasers but may be less likely to leave scars micro punch surgery is a procedure that involves using a pen like device to punch a small hole in the skin and remove tissue it s often used in hair transplant surgery but research indicates in can be very effective for removing fordyce spots also especially on the genitalia the risk of scarring with micro punch surgery is less than co2 lasers and the spots don t seem to return which is a possibility with co2 and pulsed dye laser treatments a local anesthetic is needed to eliminate the pain of micro punch surgery the tissue removed with micro punch techniques is not destroyed unlike laser therapy so it can be looked at under a microscope to rule out other more serious skin conditions such as warts or cancer micro punch treatments are generally very quick and can remove dozens of fordyce spots within minutes making it ideal for people who have hundreds of spots on their genitalia or face there s some evidence to suggest that hormonal imbalance triggered by puberty pregnancy and menopause can cause or contribute to fordyce spots in the same way they can contribute to acne pimples as such a variety of prescription creams that are normally used on acne and other skin blemishes can sometimes yield results on fordyce spots ask your dermatologist about the potential for using topical glucocorticoids retinoids clindamycin pimecrolimus or benzoyl peroxide clindamycin cream is especially helpful for combating inflamed sebaceous glands although it s rare for fordyce spots to become swollen for younger women going on oral contraceptives may reduce or eliminate fordyce spots much like how they impact acne co2 laser ablation is often combined with the use of topical exfoliating acids such as trichloracetic and bichloracetic acids a medication called 5 aminolevulinic acid is applied to the skin allowed to penetrate and then is activated with a light source such as a blue light or a pulsed dye laser this treatment can also treat and prevent certain skin cancers and acne be aware that this treatment can be expensive this treatment also makes the skin more sensitive to the sun temporarily this treatment works well for acne and other similar conditions of the sebaceous glands isotretinoin has some serious risks and possible side effects including possible birth defects so it should only be considered for serious conditions and women who take isotretinoin must abstain from sex or use birth control cryotherapy is the process of freezing off the bumps using liquid nitrogen talk to your dermatologist about the possibility of using this treatment to get rid of fordyce spots this is a form of laser therapy that burns off the fordyce spots talk to your dermatologist about whether or not this might be an option for you keeping your skin clean and free of excess oils and bacteria can help reduce the occurrence of fordyce spots in some people particularly during teen years and pregnancy when hormone levels soar but it s not a reliable way of getting rid of existing spots in most cases using clarifying agents to clean your face and genitals may help to unclog pores and sebaceous glands which is also an effective strategy to prevent black heads pimples wash your genitals and face thoroughly on a regular basis particularly after exercising and sweating consider using a mild exfoliating agent such as a loofah pad when cleaning your skin if you have fordyce spots on your genitalia avoid shaving your pubic hair because the spots might become more noticeable laser hair removal may be a better choice although fordyce spots appear in the same areas of the body as herpes lesions around the lips and genitalia they are very different conditions unlike fordyce spots herpes lesions look like red blisters or ulcers and they are initially very itchy before becoming painful usually described as burning pain also herpes lesions are usually larger than fordyce spots herpes are caused by the herpes simplex virus either type 1 or 2 and are very contagious in contrast fordyce spots are not contagious after an outbreak herpes lesions fade away and usually only reappear in times of stress fordyce spots sometimes fade away but usually they are permanent or even get a little worse with age fordyce spots can look a lot like genital warts particularly during their early stages when the warts are quite small both conditions also appear around the genitalia however genital warts can grow to be much larger than fordyce spots and are caused by hpv or human papillomavirus hpv is also contagious and transmitted primarily by skin to skin contact through a cut abrasion or small tear in your skin as genital warts grow they often develop into cauliflower like bumps or tiny stem like protrusions in contrast fordyce spots often look like chicken skin or sometimes goose bumps especially when the skin is stretched genital warts often spread to the anus regions whereas fordyce spots rarely do genital warts increase your risk of cancer of the cervix in contrast fordyce spots are not associated with any other condition folliculitis is an inflammation of the hair follicles that s commonly seen around the opening of the vagina and base of the penis folliculitis involves the formation of little pustules around the pubic hair follicles they are frequently itchy sometimes painful and red and release some pus if squeezed similar to a pustule pimple in contrast fordyce spots are rarely itchy never painful and can sometimes release a thick oily discharge if squeezed similar to a black head pimple folliculitis is often caused by shaving the pubic region and irritating hair follicles bacteria are sometimes involved although it s not considered a contagious condition folliculitis is often successfully treated with topical creams or oral antibiotics and better hygiene measures including quitting shaving with a razor it s not recommended to squeeze fordyce spots because you may inflame them and make them larger

secondary language french speaking regions or countries you might want to visit include francebelgiumalgeriagabonsenegalquebec the combination of audio video and text in subtitled videos makes them a powerful learning tool as they engage many learning styles try to watch at least thirty minutes each day do not choose a romantic comedy when you prefer science fiction look for films that you ll

times until you feel comfortable with it this will ensure you get important practice speaking french as well as writing and reading it it should be quiet and well lit with a clean uncluttered desk when you re ready to study french go to your study space and begin learning study in both long and short sessions throughout the day when you have ten or fifteen minutes free during lunch or when traveling on the bus you should break out your french books and study materials or pop some earbuds in and listen to some french conversation then when you have time after or before work sit for at least an hour and practice french intensively in your designated study space if you hear or read a word you re unfamiliar with you can look it up to learn what it means with your dictionary if you don t know a certain word in french you can look it up in english to get its french translation when you look up new words or if you have words that give you trouble write them in your study journal and repeat them out loud at least three times look up words that you can relate to your own life for instance if you re a computer programmer look up the words necessary to introduce yourself and say i m a computer programmer don t check the dictionary constantly doing so may hamper your learning process use the dictionary only when you need to check the meaning of a certain word or words focus instead on getting the overall meaning of things and the general phrasing of sentences rather than on the meaning of individual words furthermore it s more productive to try and guess at the meaning of words you don t know before looking them up in a dictionary these books are useful tools to help you learn key phrases and practice sentence miming the textbook will have elements of the phrasebook but it will also clarify pronunciation grammar and provide greater depth than the phrase book will the best textbooks will include a cd with audio on it to help familiarize you with conversational french and provide opportunities for speaking practice check your local bookstore for french language texbooks while a deep understanding of french grammar is not necessary to learn the language quickly understanding some basic rules regarding subject object and verb placement might be useful there are many apps and online programs available that turn learning french into a fun game for instance babbel and duolingo are two popular websites that allow you to learn french among other languages at your own pace and at your own level brief lessons followed by quizzes on the material will let you set your own pace and learn as quickly as you want there are also some more expensive programs available like rosetta stone that serve the same function as the online learning tools and apps are you planning a summer trip to paris are you doing humanitarian work in algeria are you trying to impress a friend from belgium whatever your reason for learning french quickly stay motivated by writing your purpose down in the front cover of the notebook you use during your french study sessions focus on the most useful phrases and words pertaining to your situation and goals the sticky note should have the name of the objects written on it for instance you might write the word frigo on a sticky note and stick it on the fridge that way every time you go to open your fridge or even just walk past it you ll see the word and make the association in your head that frigo means fridge because of grammatical differences between french and english you might get confused if you try to translate directly between the two languages instead learn whole phrases and use imagery to remember them for instance you might remember the french phrase je t aime i love you with a mental image of two people kissing even if you aren t speaking french out loud say the french word for everything you see and touch in your head when you think do it in french try to incorporate simple french words or phrases into conversation with your close friends and family for instance you might answer a friend s question with a simple oui or bien 
query	192	determine gear ratio in mechanical engineering a gear ratio is a direct measure of the ratio of the rotational speeds of two or more interlocking gears as a general rule when dealing with two gears if the drive gear the one directly receiving rotational force from the engine motor etc is bigger than the driven gear the latter will turn more quickly and vice versa we can express this basic concept with the formula gear ratio t2 t1 where t1 is the number of teeth on the first gear and t2 is the number of teeth on the second 1 finding the gear ratio of a gear train two gears more than two gears making ratio speed calculations start with a two gear train count the number of teeth on the drive gear count the number of teeth on the driven gear divide one teeth count by the other start with a gear train of more than two gears divide the teeth numbers of the drive and driven gears if desired find the gear ratios for the intermediate gears find the rotational speed of your drive gear plug your information into the formula s1 t1 s2 t2 solve to be able to determine a gear ratio you must have at least two gears engaged with each other this is called a gear train usually the first gear is a drive gear attached to the motor shaft and the second is a driven gear attached to the load shaft there may also be any number of gears between these two to transmit power from the drive gear to the driven gear these are called idler gears for now let s look at a gear train with only two gears in it to be able to find a gear ratio these gears have to be interacting with each other in other words their teeth need to be meshed and one should be turning the other for example purposes let s say that you have one small drive gear gear 1 turning a larger driven gear gear 2 one simple way to find the gear ratio between two interlocking gears is to compare the number of teeth the little peg like protrusions at the edge of the wheel that they both have start by determining how many teeth are on the drive gear you can do this by counting manually or sometimes by checking for this information labeled on the gear itself for example purposes let s say that the smaller drive gear in our system has 20 teeth next determine how many teeth are on the driven gear exactly as you did before for the drive gear let s say that in our example the driven gear has 30 teeth now that you know how many teeth are on each gear you can find the gear ratio relatively simply divide the driven gear teeth by the drive gear teeth depending on your assignment you may write your answer as a decimal a fraction or in ratio form i e x y in our example dividing the 30 teeth of the driven gear by the 20 teeth of the drive gear gets us 30 20 1 5 we can also write this as 3 2 or 1 5 1 etc what this gear ratio means is that the smaller driver gear must turn one and a half times to get the larger driven gear to make one complete turn this makes sense since the driven gear is bigger it will turn more slowly as its name suggests a gear train can also be made from a long sequence of gears not just a single driver gear and a single driven gear in these cases the first gear remains the driver gear the last gear remains the driven gear and the ones in the middle become idler gears these are often used to change the direction of rotation or to connect two gears when direct gearing would make them unwieldy or not readily available let s say for example purposes that the two gear train described above is now driven by a small seven toothed gear in this case the 30 toothed gear remains the driven gear and the 20 toothed gear which was the driver before is now an idler gear the important thing to remember when dealing with gear trains with more than two gears is that only the driver and driven gears usually the first and last ones matter in other words the idler gears don t affect the gear ratio of the overall train at all when you ve identified your driver gear and your driven gear you can find the gear ratio exactly as before in our example we would find the gear ratio by dividing the thirty teeth of the driven gear by the seven teeth of our new driver 30 7 about 4 3 or 4 3 1 etc this means that the driver gear has to turn about 4 3 times to get the much larger driven gear to turn once you can find the gear ratios involving the idler gears as well and you may want to in certain situations in these cases start from the drive gear and work toward the load gear treat the preceding gear as if it were the drive gear as far as the next gear is concerned divide the number of teeth on each driven gear by the number of teeth on the drive gear for each interlocking set of gears to calculate the intermediate gear ratios in our example the intermediate gear ratios are 20 7 2 9 and 30 20 1 5 note that neither of these are equal to the gear ratio for the entire train 4 3 however note also that 20 7 30 20 4 3 in general the intermediate gear ratios of a gear train will multiply together to equal the overall gear ratio using the idea of gear ratios it s easy to figure out how quickly a driven gear is rotating based on the input speed of the drive gear to start find the rotational speed of your drive gear in most gear calculations this is given in rotations per minute rpm though other units of velocity will also work for example let s say that in the example gear train above with a seven toothed driver gear and a 30 toothed driven gear the drive gear is rotating at 130 rpms with this information we ll find the speed of the driven gear in the next few steps in this formula s1 refers to the rotational speed of the drive gear t1 refers to the teeth in the drive gear and s2 and t2 to the speed and teeth of the driven gear fill in the variables until you have only one left undefined often in these sorts of problems you ll be solving for s2 though it s perfectly possible to solve for any of the variables in our example plugging in the information we have we get this 130 rpms 7 s2 30 finding your remaining variable is a matter of basic algebra just simplify the rest of the equation and isolate the variable on one side of the equals sign and you will have your answer don t forget to label it with the correct units you can lose points for this in schoolwork in our example we can solve like this 130 rpms 7 s2 30910 s2 30910 30 s230 33 rpms s2in other words if the drive gear spins at 130 rpms the driven gear will spin at 30 33 rpms this makes sense since the driven gear is much bigger it will spin much slower

snacking a goat s hair should be neat and trimmed prior to a show in the days leading up to the show make sure to give your goat a good trim use a pair of shears to trim uneven hair on your goat target hair around the hooves on the belly in the ears and at the bottom of the tail you should also trim any uneven hairs on the goat s chin check the expectations of the show you re attending it may be preferable to shave your goat if you choose to shave your goat do it at least two weeks before the show use a blade that trims hair between 1 2 and 1 4 inch long the hair on the hocks and knees

heel and toe are on the same level de horning is required in some competitions check regulations at your show if you need to de horn your goat do so prior to the show you will need a de horning iron which you can get at a livestock store it will need to be plugged in to warm up for about 10 minutes trim the area around the goat s horns with a pair of shears then put your goat in a holding box this is a box that restricts a goat s movements allowing you to de horn safely you should also have a helper hold the goat still while you work place the de horner around the budding horn rotate the de horner counter clockwise for 3 to 4 seconds a copper ring should form at the base of the bud use a sharp knife to cut off the bud at the copper ring it should come off fairly easily repeat with the other horn different shows have different rules you want to see what is required in your show you may have to walk the goat and show the goat in a specific manner ask your 4 h leader to provide you with guidelines and read them closely before the show there will also probably be guidelines in terms of what kind of paperwork you need for the show you want to make sure you have all your materials assembled before it s time to show your goat once you know what to expect practice nothing will prepare your goat better than regular practice prior to the show practice leading your goat around using a harness and lead rope if you need to move your goat for the judge in any specific way such as making the goat walk backwards practice prior to the show practice every night leading up to the show you and your goat should have the expected routine down before the show begins these are required for 4 h shows the scrapie is a tag that goes on your goat s ear verifying your ownership an id from your state s board of animal health assures that your goat is healthy regulations vary in terms of how to get the scrapie tag ask your 4 h leader about regulations in your state you should also be able to find this information somewhere on your state government s website usually the id from the board of animal health is some kind of certificate your goat may also be given some kind of animal identification number as with the scrapie tag how to get this paperwork varies by state check with your 4 h leader or check your government s website at the show you will be asked to present your goat to judges keep calm and follow your judge s instructions how exactly you present your goat varies state by state make sure you give equal attention to the goat and the judge shift your gaze from your goat to the judge throughout the presentation make sure not to do anything to draw attention away from the goat avoid fidgeting or talking too much you should only talk when the judge asks you a question the judge will ask you at some point to walk with your goat lead your goat around the arena with the lead rope as the judge watches walk slowly the proper speed for your goat is one step at a time if you walk with other goats leave an adequate amount of space there should be enough space that one goat could fit between your goat and the goat ahead of you the judge may request that you move to the right or backwards slightly this is to help the judge get a good view of the goat follow the judge s instructions carefully to assure you get a high score if you need to switch sides always walk in front of the goat rather than behind the goat 
query	194	custom paint your electric guitar if you re tired of the look of your old electric guitar a custom paint job is a great way to switch things up and revitalize it however painting your guitar isn t as easy as just taking a brush with paint to the body of the guitar before you start painting your guitar you ll need to take it apart and remove the old paint from it from there you can apply a coat of sealer base color and finally a clear gloss coat that will make the finish shiny if you do everything correctly you can transform the old color on your guitar to something new removing the old finish sealing the guitar applying paint to your guitar remove your guitar strings and the screws in the body of the guitar remove the electrical components connecting the bridge and pickups heat the old paint with a hairdryer or heat gun lift off the old paint with a putty knife sand the body of the guitar fill any holes with an automotive filler sand the automotive filler so it lies flush with the guitar s surface dust the guitar with a dry rag lay the guitar down on a flat surface choose a wood sealer apply wood sealer to the guitar allow the guitar to dry and apply three to five coats of sealer let the sealer dry for three days sand off the shiny portions of the sealer choose a paint for your guitar spray your base coat onto the guitar let the paint dry for ten minutes flip the guitar over and spray the other side apply additional coats of base paint to the guitar let the paint dry sand the paint using 400 grit wet sandpaper spray clear lacquer onto the guitar let the guitar dry for three weeks polish the guitar with car polish remove the guitar strings and then unscrew the neck of the guitar from the body once the body is standing alone unscrew the screws and knobs on the front of the guitar remove the screws on the pickups and bridge of the guitar if there is a faceplate over your volume knobs you ll have to remove the plastic portions of the knobs before you can lift the faceplate off once all of the screws are out on the face of the guitar you can lift up your bridge and pickups which are connected by wires snip these and solder them later when you put your guitar back together if you feel unsure about taking your guitar apart take it to a guitar store so that they can safely do it for you make sure all the electrical wiring is removed from the guitar before you start painting it set your heat gun or hairdryer to the lowest setting and move it back and forth across the body of your guitar the heat from your hairdryer or heat gun will soften the finish on your guitar and make it easier to lift up the paint continue heating the paint for five minutes and then use a sharp tool to poke at the paint if the paint feels soft you can go onto the next step do not hold the heat gun in one spot for too long or you may burn the wood that s under the paint start by scoring a small location on the softened paint use your putty knife to lift off the old finish and don t worry if it cracks off continue to scrape the paint and remove the old finish without damaging the wood under it if the paint isn t coming off use the heat gun again to soften it once you re done removing the finish you should see the wood grain under it use a 100 grit sandpaper at first and sand over the surface of the guitar s body in the direction of the grain sand down irregularities so that the body of the guitar is as smooth as possible follow the contours of the guitar and sand the sides and edges of the guitar as well once you ve sanded it with the 100 grit sandpaper you can move to a 200 grit sandpaper to sand out smaller irregularities use a sanding block if the sandpaper is hurting your hands as you sand down your guitar you re likely to find bumps or divots in the body fill divots that you can t sand down with an automotive filler once the divots are filled let it dry for at least 20 minutes so that the automotive filler can cure bondo is a popular type of automotive filler once you ve filled in all divots and the guitar is relatively smooth you ll have to do one last sanding with the 100 grit sandpaper continue to sand until the automotive filler lies flush with the body of the guitar don t saturate the wood grain on your guitar to prevent moisture from getting absorbed into to the guitar take a microfiber cloth or a clean rag and wipe over the surface making sure to remove any sawdust or debris that might be on the guitar debris or dust left on the guitar will get sealed into the paint job lay down drop cloths under the guitar so that the paint doesn t stain the surface that you re painting on alternatively you can hang the guitar from the ceiling and spray it as it s suspended in the air you can purchase wood sealer online or at a hardware store purchase a water based wood sealer that has a high gloss if you are painting your guitar a lighter color use a white sealer and if you re painting it a dark color apply a gray sealer saturate a dry rag in the sealer once the rag is saturated drag it along the grain on the surface of your guitar make long movements and do not scrub in a single area with the sealer once the back of the guitar is sealed turn the guitar over and finish sealing the front and sides once your rag looks dirty dispose of it and use another clean rag let the sealer dry for an hour or two and come back and apply another even coat of sealer the sealer will help the colored coats of paint adhere to the body of the guitar much easier continue adding more coats of sealer until you ve covered the guitar three to five times in total remember to let the sealer dry in between each new application feel over the sealer to make sure that it s no longer wet or sticky make sure that the guitar dries in a well ventilated area so no one gets sick from the sealer s fumes using a 200 grit sandpaper carefully sand over the shiny parts of the sealer make sure not to sand too hard or you may expose the wood grain underneath if you do do this simply reapply more coats of sealer to the guitar and allow it to dry before moving on when you re done the guitar should have a dull white or gray color typical guitar paint includes polyester polyurethane and nitrocellulose polyurethane and polyester will result in a harder more plastic feeling finish on your guitar while nitrocellulose is lighter and thinner if you re unsure of what kind of paint to get look for spray paint that s made specifically for guitars position the nozzle on the spray can 12 to 18 inches 30 48 to 45 72 cm away from the body of the guitar remember to cover the edges of the guitar press down on the button on the spray can and go in long sweeping back and forth motions across the body of the guitar touch the surface of the guitar to make sure that none of the paint transfers to your hand the paint may still be sticky and you ll still be able to see the sealer under the basecoat that you just sprayed once the guitar is dry flip it over and spray down the other side of the guitar you should now have one solid basecoat of paint over the front and back of your guitar allow each coat of paint to dry for five minutes before applying the next coat continue flipping the guitar over so that the entire guitar gets even coverage continue to cover your guitar in coats of paint until the paint gets darker and richer this could take anywhere from three to seven coats of paint once you re done laying down the base color for your guitar you ll have to let the paint dry for another one or two days in a well ventilated area once it s completely dry you can move onto the next step once the color coat is dry run your fingers over the surface sides and back of the guitar to see if the paint is smooth if the paint rises too high in some spots or has become bumpy you should sand it down with a wet sandpaper saturate the sandpaper in water overnight then work it along the rough parts of your guitar while it s still wet wet sandpaper will not scratch the surface of your guitar clear lacquer paint will give your guitar a shiny finish over the paint you can purchase clear lacquer paint at a home improvement store or online spray the clear lacquer the same way you sprayed the base coat putting four separate coats of lacquer on the guitar and letting the paint dry in between sprays don t touch your guitar for three weeks as the paint dries during this time the paint will cure and should be a rich solid color but will be missing the polish that guitars typically have saturate a rag or cloth with car polish and work it on the surface of the guitar using small circular motions this should refine the shine in the guitar and make it more reflective one you re done polishing the guitar it should be shiny and reflective

hours or overnight twist your hair into buns twist your hair around a headband twist your hair in sections to create waves most curling irons will need about 1 5 minutes to heat up before you can use them if you try to curl your hair with the iron before it reaches the correct temperature the curls will not hold some curling irons will have different settings which you can play around with until you achieve the best result try to keep it at the lowest temperature possible though to cause less damage to your hair look for curling irons that say no damage on the box a good guide is 320 f 160 c for fine hair and 430 f 220 c for thicker hair putting a hot iron on damp hair can seriously damage it not because the iron is too hot but because the water will turn to scalding steam wet hair is also more fragile than dry hair making it more prone to heat damage play it safe and completely dry your hair first run a blowdryer over any damp spots although try to wait it out depending on your hair thickness this may take time but if you want to reduce heat on your hair you can wait however if using a blow drying is the best option for you keep it on a cool setting if you re not sure whether or not your hair is completely dry set your dryer on the cold shot setting and go over your entire head with it the cool air will make any damp spots feel cold to the touch start at the end of your hair and brush out the bottom few inches or centimeters then work your way up until you can easily brush through the length of your hair this reduces damage to you hair like split ends fallout etc if you regularly use heat to style your hair it s really important that you use a heat protection spray it will protect your hair from the damage caused by exposure to high temperatures and prevent it from becoming dry and frazzled looking just spray it liberally all over your hair before curling heat protector sprays can be found at most drug stores and hair salons even if you have thin hair you ll get better results if you work with small sections of hair that way you can make sure you re curling everything and curl in a more uniform style create sections that are slightly smaller in diameter than the curling iron pin or clip up the top section of your hair using your thumbs grab everything that s above the top of your ears and clip it up on top of your head release upper sections as you work when the bottom section of hair is finished unclip your hair and let out a little more clipping up the excess again continue working this way until all your hair is curled remember that using bigger sections of hair will result in bigger looser curls while using smaller sections of hair will give you smaller tighter ringlets now that all the prep work is out of the way you re ready to start curling begin by taking a small section of hair and wrap it around the curling iron beginning at the top or bottom depending on the type of tongs some curling irons will have a clamp near the handle if this is the type of curling tongs you re using open the clamp and position the end of the hair at the lower end of the barrel near the handle then close the clamp to secure then you can wrap that entire section of hair around the iron by rolling the iron upwards towards your roots stop rolling when you get about an inch away from the roots to prevent the iron from burning your scalp other curling irons often referred to as wands don t have a clamp with this type of iron you should start near the top of your hair and use your hand to wrap a piece of hair around the iron you will need to hold the end of your hair in place while that section of hair curls some curling wands provide a safety glove that you can wear while doing this to prevent your hand from burning you will need to hold the curling iron with the hair wrapped around it for a few seconds while the hair heats up and curls this should take approximately 10 seconds but the time will vary according to the individual curling iron and the temperature it s heated to play around to find a time that creates a perfect curl with your iron but remember to start out with a lower time to prevent your hair from burning after 10 seconds let go of your hair to release the curl if your hair is still a little flat try pinning it while it s still curled once your hair is completely cool take all the pins out of each curl once you are happy with how your first curl turned out move on to the next piece of hair and do the same steps as before to achieve a uniform look wrap all the curls around the iron in the same direction alternating the direction of the wrap creates a more natural effect if you want your hair to look softer and looser run your fingers through the curls a few times the curls will pull down and loosen up as you do so you can also turn your head upside down and use your fingers to fluff up and separate the curls once you have curled your hair do not brush it with a hairbrush it will loosen the curls too much and they will fall out if you brush out curls with a hairbrush your hair will look wavy rather that curly which can be a nice style in itself if you tend to have straight hair or you re worried about your curls turning frizzy or falling out throughout the day mist some hairspray over your curls if you want tight curls you can spray each curl individually as soon as you ve finished with it but if you want a looser style wait until the curls have relaxed a little and only spray them when you ve finished curling your entire head choose a loose hold hairspray so your curls aren t too stiff and you hair doesn t feel too crunchy hold the can about 12 14 in 30 5 cm 35 5 cm away from your head and spray evenly around your head be careful not to apply too much never apply hairspray to the curls while they are still wrapped around the iron the combination of the heat from the irons and the alcohol in the hairspray will fry your hair however if your hair is fine or limp you can create a more durable curl by spraying each section before wrapping spraying before wrapping instead of after will also result in curls that are softer and less crunchy most flat irons will need a little time to heat up before you can use them if you try to curl your hair with the iron before it reaches the correct temperature the curls will not hold some flat irons will have different settings which you can play around with until you achieve the best result try to keep it at the lowest temperature possible though to cause less damage to your hair a good guide is 320 f 160 c for fine hair and 430 f 220 c for thicker hair the width of the flat iron is also important when it comes to curling your hair you need to use a flat iron that is narrow about 1 2 inches or 2 5 5 cm in width with rounded edges a flat paddle style flat iron will not work for curls putting a hot iron on damp hair can seriously damage it not because the iron is too hot but because the water will turn to scalding steam play it safe and completely dry your hair first run a blowdryer over any damp spots you can add a little volumizing mousse to your hair before drying which will help give you bouncy curls and prevent your hair from looking flat once styled brush out any tangles while the iron heats up start at the end of your hair and brush out the bottom few inches then work your way up until you can easily brush through the length of your hair even if you have thin hair you ll get better results if you work with small sections of hair that way you can make sure you re curling everything and curl in a more uniform style pin or clip up the top section of your hair using your thumbs grab everything that s above the top of your ears and clip it up on top of your head release layers as you work when the bottom layer of hair is finished unclip your hair and let out a little more clipping up the excess again continue working this way until all your hair is curled now that all the prep work is out of the way you re ready to start curling grab the piece of hair you wish to curl and give it a quick brush through to remove any remaining tangles clamp the flat iron around the hair and give it a half turn so that your hair is in a u shape hold the flat iron in this position as you move it down the hair shaft right to the ends the position of the flat iron will determine what kind of curls you end up with if you want your hair curled from the root to tip position the flat iron as close to your scalp as possible without burning it if you just want to curl just the ends of your hair position the flat iron about halfway down the hair to begin this is called a flick the slower you move the iron the tighter the curls will be if you move the iron down the hair too quickly your curls will be soft and loose remember that using bigger sections of hair more than two inches wide will result in bigger looser curls while using smaller sections of hair less than two inches will give you smaller tighter ringlets if you want your hair to look softer and looser run your fingers through the curls a few times the curls will pull down and loosen up as you do so you can also turn your head upside down and use your fingers to fluff up and separate the curls wait until your hair has cooled completely before attempting to loosen the curls once you have curled your hair do not brush it with a hairbrush it will loosen the curls too much and they will fall out if you brush out curls with a hairbrush your hair will look wavy rather that curly which can be a nice style in itself if you tend to have straight hair or you re worried about your curls turning frizzy or falling out throughout the day mist some hairspray over your curls if you want tight curls you can

head choose a loose hold hairspray so your curls aren t too stiff and you hair doesn t feel too crunchy hold the can about 12 14 in 30 5 cm 35 5 cm away from your head and spray evenly around your head be careful not to apply too much never apply hairspray to your hair before you curl it as some styling guides recommend the combination of the heat from the irons and the alcohol in the hairspray will fry your hair hair rollers come in many different types shapes and sizes try to choose a set of rollers that work best for your hair type and also for the type of curls you are trying to achieve hot rollers are very efficient and will curl hair more quickly but they are more damaging to your hair velcro rollers and foam rollers are very easy to use but your curls will take a little longer to set velcro rollers are also a great option for hair that is naturally smooth as they are less likely to get tangled in your hair small curlers will give you lots of tight curls whereas large rollers will give you big loose waves and are great for adding volume depending on the type of rollers your hair may need to be wet or dry when putting them in hot rollers should always be applied to dry hair as they would cause too much damage otherwise velcro rollers are also usually applied to dry hair whereas special wet set rollers are used if you want to put them in while wet if you are applying rollers to dry hair try to wash your hair the day before you curl day old hair will curl much better than freshly washed hair if your hair is particularly resistant to curling try skipping the conditioner after shampooing this will make sure your hair isn t too soft for the roller to get a good grip on the hair if you are doing a wet set be aware that you will have to wait for your hair to be completely dry before removing the rollers which may take a long time consider putting the rollers in wet hair before bed and sleeping with them in overnight using a little product can go a long way when using hair rollers again which type of product you use will depend on what type of rollers you use and whether your hair is wet or dry if you re using hot rollers you should use a heat protection product like a mist or dry oil to prevent your hair from being damaged a setting product will also help curls to hold their shape if you re using velcro or foam rollers you should use a setting product along with some volumizing hairspray to prevent your curls from falling flat if you re doing a wet set a smoothing cream or serum can really help to minimize frizz you should divide your hair into separate sections using hair ties or claw clips the sizes of these sections will vary depending on the size of your rollers each section should be about the same width as the rollers you plan to use create a central mohawk section along the top and back of your head section off 3 4 vertical rows along the sides of your head release sections as you work when the bottom section of hair is finished unclip your hair and let out the next section continue working this way until all the rollers are in resist the urge to grab sections that are too large for the curlers you ll end up with nothing but a small curl at the bottom a one or two inch section 2 5 to 5 cm per roller is a good standard to follow the section of hair should be no wider than the roller otherwise hair will not curl properly if your rollers have variable sizes use the larger ones on the top of your head use the smaller rollers as you approach your hairline if you have long hair remember that not only the bottom part of the section will actually be touching the roller the rest of it will be layered over hair use smaller sections for more curl starting at the bottom hold the tip of your hair firmly against the roller with a finger then roll the roller up along the hair smoothly and tightly tension is the key to creating a good curl so make sure the hair is wrapped securely around the roller you should also make sure there are no lumps or bumps in your hair as you wrap it around the curler in order to create smooth consistent curls if you re using hot rollers be careful not to burn your fingers on the ends of the roller try to find a cool spot where you can consistently grip the roller as you put it into your hair while velcro rollers will attach themselves to your hair without the need for clips other rollers will need to be pinned into place some roller sets will come with pins provided these pins probably look like long u shapes with one straight side and one crimped side pin the roller so that the straight side is against your scalp and the curve of the u is cradling the roller at the side of your head be aware that these pins aren t terribly secure if you move your head too quickly or suddenly they might fall loose if no pins are provided with your set similar pins can be purchased at a drugstore alternatively butterfly clips will also work to hold the hair in place if you want to avoid an indentation from the clip on your hair try placing a tissue in between the pin and the hair once all of the rollers have been inserted in one to two inch sections from the base of your scalp to the crown of your head you will need to leave the rollers to set how long this takes will again depend on the type of roller and whether your hair is wet or dry hot rollers can be removed once they have cooled completely which usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes this is enough time for the heat to penetrate all of the hair wrapped around each individual roller as well as for the hair to cool into a curled shape velcro or foam rollers should be blasted with some heat from a hair dryer then allowed to cool and set for about 15 20 minutes the longer you leave them in the tighter the curls will be wet set rollers will need to be left in until all of your hair is completely dry which may take several hours or overnight the dampest parts of the hair are the ends that are tucked inside the curls so attempting to speed up the process with a hair dryer is unlikely to work once you re sure your hair has set you can pull out the rollers from bottom to top remove the rollers near your neck and ears first then move incrementally to the ones at the top of your head once the rollers are out you can brush out the curls to loosen them just don t overdo it your curls should keep their shape for two or three strokes but overdoing it might cause them to fall out alternatively you can just run your fingers through the curls to separate them and add a some volume mist hairspray over your hair to make sure the curl hold their shape throughout the day to avoid your curls from looking stiff make sure to hold the can 12 14 inches away from the hair for a looser look pull up a section of hair and mist it with hairspray as it falls back down you can also work a small amount of serum into your hair to add shine and reduce frizz scrunching only works properly on wet hair so in order to use this method you will need to wash your hair while taking a warm shower work your hair into a thick lather using a volumizing or curl enhancing shampoo then work a small amount of conditioner into the ends and mid lengths of your hair after you apply conditioner brush your hair with a wide toothed comb and try to get out all the major knots the conditioner will make the tangles a lot easier to tackle and will prevent you from causing damage to your hair make sure to rinse your hair thoroughly afterwards as excess product can weigh down hair and prevent it from curling as well once you get out of the shower use an absorbent towel to pat your hair dry and squeeze the ends to get excess water out if your hair is too wet any product you apply will drip out along with the water and your hair will not curl as well do not rub your hair with the towel as this will damage your hair and cause it to look frizzy you should also avoid using a hair dryer to get rid of excess moisture as the hair dryer will blow and straighten the hair making curling more difficult use a wide toothed comb to get the smaller knots out of your hair make sure no knots are left in your hair or else they will show once your hair is dry if you brushed your hair in the shower there should be no major knots left so just brush out the small ones use a detangling mist or spray if you have particularly stubborn knots always brush or comb from the ends of your hair up as this causes less damage to wet hair there are many different curling products available which you can use to scrunch your hair such as curling sprays gels and creams however the most popular product which probably provides the most defined and long lasting curls is curling mousse choose a volumizing or strong hold mousse particularly if your hair is not naturally wavy as this will help to give you long lasting voluminous curls to use the mousse shake the can before squirting a golf ball size amount of mousse into your hand turn your head upside down so your hair is in front of your face then work the product evenly into your hair with both hands only work the mousse into the ends and mid lengths of your hair avoid putting it in the roots as this may weigh your hair down or cause it to look greasy keeping your head upside down scrunch your hair by grabbing a small section in your hand and crumpling it up towards your scalp using the same motion as you would use to crumple a piece of paper use this motion to scrunch sections of hair all over your head keep doing it for a minute or two then flip your head up and scrunch again until you re happy with the style the same technique can be used regardless of what kind of curling product you use just adjust the amount of product according to the instructions on the bottle and the length of your hair more for longer hair less for shorter hair at this point you have two options you can let your hair air dry naturally using the scrunching motion every five minutes or so until it s dry or you can use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry hair gently without blowing or straightening the curls if you re using the diffuser attachment a long finger diffuser works best for curls be sure to set the hair dryer to its lowest heat and speed setting use the scrunching method as you dry to help the formation of curls if your hair is naturally curly or wavy the air dry method will usually work just fine however if your hair is naturally straight or flat using the diffuser will help give your hair a little extra oomph this method works best if you braid your hair while it s wet or damp then leave your hair to dry use a volumizing or curl enhancing shampoo and conditioner and make sure to rinse your hair well afterwards brush out your hair in the shower while you still have the conditioner in using a wide toothed comb this will make it easier to work out any tangles and will cause less damage to your hair towel dry your hair once you get out of the shower try to wring out any excess moisture if your hair already has a bit of natural curl to it you re probably fine to work with damp hair if it s stick straight though it s best to braid it wet applying a curl enhancing product to your hair will help it to keep the shape of the braids even after you ve unbraided it it will also give your hair a glossier and more controlled finish just work a small amount of your chosen product into the ends and mid lengths of your hair avoiding the roots curl enhancing or volumizing gels mousses sprays or serums will all work well use a product with a texture and scent that appeals to you if you want looser less structured curls you can skip this step the number of braids you put in your hair will determine how your curls look more braids means tighter curls for instance you ll have more crimps in your hair from doing two braids than you will from one and more from four than two however more braids means more work if you re not totally comfortable braiding or you re short on time stick to the lowest possible number that gives you the curls you want if you re doing more than one braid parting your hair into sections will make braiding easier and your finished curls neater looking they don t have to be perfect though use a comb to part a straight line from your forehead back to your neck then divide each half into however many sections you like using the comb to ensure they are a fairly uniform size doing a french braid instead of a regular braid will curl the hair up around your scalp as well see how to french braid for more detailed help ask someone else to help you it s almost always easier to braid someone else s hair than it is to do your own so consider asking for assistance tie off each braid with a non rubber hair elastic try to put the tie as close to the end of the hair as possible otherwise the tips of your hair will look straight and it will ruin the effect of the curls rubber can damage the hair shaft and is especially menacing on wet hair avoid at all costs after your hair s had six to eight hours to dry gently undo your braids the easiest thing to do is to leave them in overnight run your fingers through your hair a few times to get out any knots but avoid brushing it as this will make to too fluffy looking finish with some hairspray if you re worried about your curls falling out during the day set the style with a spritz of hairspray you can create big soft beach curls without heat or rollers by twisting your hair and putting it into buns for this method you will need hair ties hair spray and bobby pins start with damp hair you can either spritz your hair with a spray bottle or let it partially air dry after you wash it use hair ties to divide your hair into four roughly equal sections two low ponytails at the back and two pigtails higher up on the sides of your head tightly twist each section in whichever direction you prefer twisting the sections in different directions from each other will create a more natural effect coil each twisted section into a tight bun and pin it in place with bobby pins blow dry each bun until completely dry or allow the hair to air dry completely release each section and gently loosen the curls with your fingers once your hair is completely cool use a little hair spray to lock in the style you can create ringlets or waves by twisting your hair around a soft cloth headband for this technique you will need one or two headbands a spray bottle for water hair spray and a hair texturizer part your hair into two sections on either side of your head then gently place the headband around the top of your head slide it down so that it rests just above your ears dampen each section of hair slightly with a spray bottle starting at the tops of your ears begin twisting the hair on one side once you ve twisted a little bit of hair wrap the twisted portion around the headband make the first wrap just behind your ear twist a little more then create another wrap next to the first continue until you have wrapped the entire section around the headband then repeat with the other section the smaller you make each wrap the tighter your curls will be spray your hair with hairspray while it is still wrapped around the headband allow the hair to air dry for a few hours or dry with a blow dryer once your hair is dry release the twisted sections from the headband loosen your curls with your fingers and scrunch with a small amount of hair texturizer the simplest approach to creating twist curls involves making a few twisted sections and tying them together with elastic hair ties apply a little hair spray or other styling product to your slightly damp hair part your hair down the middle and divide it into four sections two behind your ears and two in front of your ears take hold of the ends of the two back sections and twist them toward each other until the entire length of both sections is twisted then fasten the twisted sections together with a hair elastic repeat with the two front sections fasten the sections together behind your head with a hair elastic once you are finished twisting them once your hair is completely dry release the sections and gently open up the waves by shaking them out or combing through them with your fingers

dead laptop s specifications before making this purchase ex if your laptop has a 2 5 sata drive you will need a 2 5 sata usb enclosure unless you have a sata drive be sure to buy a laptop sized disk enclosure only sata ready enclosures can accommodate both desktop and laptop hard drives note that disk enclosures aren t commonly found in big box stores and are usually purchased online if you had a windows use another windows if you had a mac use another mac etc make sure it has enough space to accommodate the files you want to recover from the dead laptop alternatively you can hook a second external hard drive up to the working computer and simply use the computer as a transfer system for the files a linux computer will be able to read files off of a windows computer but not the other way around unless you understand both systems however it is best to use a windows computer to recover a windows hard drive take caution though and only use disk utility during the process to mount the hard drive any other action you make on disk utility may remove contents turn off the laptop unplug it and remove the battery turn it over and you ll see that various sections of the laptop base can be unscrewed and removed separately either look up your laptop model online to see exactly where the hard drive sits or simply look for the most likely candidate though it differs between laptops a laptop hard drive is often similar in size and shape to a 3 5 inch floppy disk unscrew the hard drive cover and remove the hard drive some models will pop upwards some will slide outwards etc look for connector pins at one end of the drive to see where to make this connection if you have an ide hard drive note that there is a detachable adapter sitting over the interface simply pull this adapter off so that the drive will properly connect with the enclosure s connector plate screw it shut if necessary read the enclosure manual for additional details make sure the computer is turned on once the drive is connected an icon should appear on your desktop mac or a notification should pop up windows the computer might also open the drive for you automatically if windows doesn t automatically prompt you about the new external storage unit simply open it manually by going to my computer and looking for the new drive if the hard drive isn t recognized at first try ejecting it and plugging it back in if the hard drive is not readable it s likely that the hard drive itself and not your computer s software failed if this is the case you will need professional assistance if you wish to continue the salvage be warned that this can be very expensive transfer them to either the working computer or to a second external hard drive by copying and pasting clicking and dragging etc if you have a lot of large files ex songs movies note that the transfer could take many hours the good news is that the dead computer is still physically intact and will probably work fine if you reinstall your operating system you can now detach the old hard drive this will allow you to plug your laptop s hard drive directly into a compatible desktop computer different computers use different hard drive models so be sure to check your dead laptop s specifications before making this purchase ex if your laptop has a 2 5 sata drive you will need a 2 5 sata adapter if you had a windows use another

accessible later you will use the adapter kit to plug the old hard drive directly into the motherboard how you do this will depend on your drive and adapter types so use the instructions that came with the kit if you have an ide drive configure it to slave mode before connecting it to the ide ribbon the configuration should be noted on the hard drive itself and will involve moving a plastic cap over a particular pin or set of pins aka jumpers on the hard drive interface configuring it to slave mode will keep your laptop hard drive from competing with the desktop s master hard drive during boot up plug your desktop back in power it on and open bios go to standard cmos settings or ide config where you will find four settings involving master and slave settings change all four fields to

hasn t been fed for 4 hours some babies have their days and nights confused when they are born if your baby is more alert at night try to limit nighttime stimulation by keeping the lights dim and your talking low and be patient until your baby begins a normal sleeping cycle make sure you place your baby on his back to lower the risk of sids you should alternate the position of your baby s head whether it s leaning to the left or the right to eliminate the soft spot that can appear on a baby s face if he spends too much time sleeping with his head in one position if you want to breastfeed your baby then feeding your baby the first time you hold her after she is delivered is a great place to start you should turn your baby s body toward you so you are holding her chest toward yours

of the formula when you prepare it sterilize new bottles feed your baby every two or three hours or whenever he seems hungry discard any formula left out of the fridge for over an hour or any left unfinished by the baby store formula in the fridge no longer than 24 hours you can carefully warm it because many babies prefer it that way but it s not necessary hold your baby at a 45 degree angle to help him take in less air cradle him in a semi upright position offering plenty of head support tilt the bottle so the nipple and neck are filled with formula never prop it which can cause the baby to choke whether you re using cloth or disposable diapers if you plan on taking care of your newborn you ll have to be a diaper changing expert and fast whatever method you use and you should decide before you bring home your baby you should be prepared to change your baby s diaper around 10 times a day here what you have to do get your supplies ready you ll need a clean diaper fasteners if you use cloth diapers diaper ointment for rashes a container of warm water a clean washcloth and some cotton balls or diaper wipes remove your baby s dirty diaper if it s wet place your baby on his back and remove the diaper and use the water and washcloth to wipe your baby s genital area wipe girls from front to back to avoid utis if you see a rash place some ointment on it open the new diaper and slide it under your baby gently lifting your baby s legs and feet move the front of the diaper up between your baby s legs over the belly then bring the adhesive strips around and snugly fasten them so the diaper is nice and secure to avoid diaper rash change your baby s diaper as soon as possible after a bowel movement using soap and water to wipe your baby let your baby go undiapered for a few hours each day to let your baby s bottom air out a bit during the first week you should carefully give your baby a sponge bath once the umbilical cord falls off you can start bathing your baby regularly around two to three times a week to do this the right way you should gather your supplies such as towels soap a clean diaper etc in advance so that your baby isn t fussing around fill the tub or baby tub with about three inches of warm water before you begin the bath here s what you should do next see if you can get help you may feel a little scared or uncertain when you bathe your baby for the first time if so see if you can get your partner or a family member involved that way one person can hold the baby in the water while the other person bathes the baby undress your baby carefully then slip your baby into the tub feet first while using one of your hands to support the baby s neck and hands continue to pour warm cupfuls of water into the bath so your baby doesn t get cold use mild soap and use it sparingly so you don t get it into your baby s eyes wash your baby with your hand or with a washcloth making sure to gently wash your baby from top to bottom and from front to back clean your baby s body genitals scalp hair and any dried mucus that has collected on your baby s face rinse your baby with cupfuls of warm water wipe your baby clean with a washcloth lift the baby out of the tub continuing to use one hand to support her neck and head be careful babies are slippery when wet wrap your baby in a hooded towel and pat your baby dry after that put a diaper and dress on your baby and kiss him so he has positive associations with being bathed you may be intimidated by how tiny and fragile your newborn seems but with a few basic techniques you should feel more confident about handling your baby in no time here are some things you should do wash or sanitize your hands before you handle your baby newborn babies are susceptible to infection because their immune systems aren t quite so strong yet make sure that your hands and the hands of anyone else who handles the baby are clean before you make contact support your baby s head and neck to hold your baby cradle his head whenever you carry him and support it when you re holding the baby upright or putting him down babies can t hold up their own heads yet so don t ever let a baby s head flop around avoid shaking your baby whether you re playing or angry this can cause bleeding in the brain which can lead to death don t try to wake up your baby by shaking it either instead tickle its feet or give it another gentle touch learn to swaddle your baby this is a great way to keep your baby feeling secure before he reaches the two month mark you have to make sure to give your baby as much head and neck support as possible when you hold it you should let the baby s head rest inside your inner elbow with the length of his body resting on your forearm his outer hip and upper legs should rest with your hand with its inside arm resting over his chest and abdomen hold the baby snugly and give your baby all of your attention you can also hold the baby by pacing his tummy on your upper chest while using the same side hand to hold his body while using the opposite hang to support the baby s head from the back if your baby has older siblings or cousins or is around people unfamiliar with holding babies carefully instruct them on how to hold the baby and make sure they are sitting down with a knowing adult nearby to keep the baby safe since your baby spends so much of its time on its back it s important to also give your baby time to stay on his tummy so that he develops both mentally and physically and strengthens his arms head and neck some doctors say babies should get 15 20 minutes of tummy time a day while others say that you should just place your baby on his tummy for 5 minutes during different parts of the day as he develops you can start with tummy time as soon as a week after the baby is born once the umbilical chord falls off to make tummy time fun get level with your baby make eye contact tickle your baby and play around tummy time is hard work and some babies will be resistant to it don t be surprised or give in if this happens your baby s umbilical cord stump should fall off within the first two weeks of its life it will change in color from a yellowish green to brown and black as it dries and falls off on its own it s important to care for it properly before it falls off to avoid infection here s what you should do keep it clean clean it with plain water and dry it with a clean and absorbent cloth make sure to wash your hands before you handle it stick to giving your baby sponge baths until it falls off keep it dry expose it to air so the base dries out keeping the front of your baby s diaper folded down so it is uncovered resist the urge to pull it off let the stump fall off at its own pace keep an eye out for signs of infection it s natural to see a bit of dried blood or a little bit of crust near the stump however you should see a doctor immediately if the stump produces a smelly discharge or yellowish pus continues to bleed or is swollen and red if your baby is upset it s not always easy to find the reason right away through there are a few tricks you can try check for a wet diaper try feeding them if that doesn t work try adding a layer of clothing if it s cold out or removing a layer if it s hot sometimes your baby just wants to be held or is experiencing too much stimulation as you get to know your newborn you ll become better at finding what s wrong your baby also may just need to be burped rocking them gently and singing or humming a lullaby to them will help give them a pacifier if that doesn t work they might just be tired so lay them down sometimes babies just cry and you have to let them until they fall asleep you can t play with the child just yet but they do get bored like we do try taking them for a walk to the park once a day talking to them putting pictures in the room where they spend most of their time listening to music or taking them in the car remember that your baby is just a baby and is not ready for rough play do not roughhouse or shake your baby and be as gentle as possible instead in the beginning the most important thing you can do is to bond with your baby this means you should stroke your baby cradle your baby give the baby some skin to skin contact or even consider giving your baby an infant massage babies love vocal sounds and it s never too early to start talking babbling singing or cooing with your baby play some music for the baby while you re bonding or play with toys that make noise such as rattles or mobiles some babies are more sensitive to touch and light than others so if your baby doesn t seem to be responding well to your attempts at bonding then you can take it easier with the noise and lights until your baby gets used to it your baby will pay frequent visits to the doctor during its first year for scheduled check ups and shots many first newborn visits occur just 1 3 days after you and your baby are discharged from the hospital after that each doctor s program will vary slightly but you should generally take your newborn to the doctor at least two weeks to a month after birth after the second month and then every other month or so it s important to schedule regular visits with your baby to make sure that your baby is growing normally and receiving the necessary care it s also important to pay a visit to your doctor in case you notice anything abnormal even if you re not sure that what is happening is abnormal you should always call the doctor s office to check some symptoms you should look out for include dehydration less than three wet diapers per day excessive sleepiness dry mouthbowel movement problems no movement during the first two days white mucus in stool flecks or streaks of red in the stool overly high or low temperaturerespiratory problems grunting flaring of nostrils fast or noisy breathing chest retractionsumbilical cord stump problems pus odor or bleeding from stumpjaundice yellow color in the chest body or eyesprolonged crying crying for over thirty minutesother illness persistent coughing diarrhea paleness forceful vomiting for more than two consecutive feedings fewer feedings than 6 per day you ll need to be prepared to take your baby on car rides before the baby is born since you ll need a way to get the baby home from the hospital you ll need to get a car seat that is appropriate for newborns and to make sure that it is secure and safe for your baby though you may not need to spend a lot of time in the car with your newborn some mothers find that taking the baby for a ride can actually help put him or her to sleep you should also get an infant seat for your baby these seats are there to help your young baby sit up not to help your baby be secured in a car in this kind of seat the base should have nonskid surfacing and should be wider than the seat and it should have a secure locking mechanism along with washable fabric never place your baby in the seat on an elevated surface that the baby can fall from as for child safety seats make sure the seat meets federal motor vehicle safety standard 213 and that it actually fits your child infants and toddles should sit in a rear facing seat until they are at least 2 years old if you re raising a baby solo then you will need as much mental and emotional strength as possible if you re lucky enough to have a spouse or a caring parent or parent in law then it s important to arrange for some extra help to be there when your baby is born if you can hire a nurse great but if not just see if you can get some extra help preferably from people who know what they re doing even if your baby spends most of his time sleeping you will be feeling a bit overwhelmed and the more help you have the more confident you ll feel about handling your baby you need a good support system for your family and you it may be a husband boyfriend or your own mom and dad you need someone always there for you and your child throughout their childhood if you re trying to raise your baby completely alone you will be likely to run into trouble or to feel exhausted that being said you should also establish visiting hours and rules having too many friends and family members show up for unexpected visits to see the baby can actually lead to more stress though it s important that you be there to take care of your baby this does not mean that you should neglect caring for yourself make sure to bathe regularly maintain a healthy diet and to get as much sleep as you can you and your spouse can work out a system where both of you have at least some time to take care of yourself while this probably won t be the time for you to take up a new hobby or to start writing a memoir you should make sure to get some exercise see your friends at least a little bit and just to have some me time when you can get it don t think that you re being selfish by wanting a bit of time to yourself after your baby has just been born if you take even a little bit of time to take care of yourself you ll be a better caretaker for your baby be easy on yourself this is not the time to clean the whole house or lose 10 pounds anything can happen especially during the first month of your baby s life make sure you haven t made too many plans and that you re prepared to give your baby the time it needs eliminate your stress in advance by letting people know that you ll be very busy with your baby and don t force yourself to socialize too much or to make appearances with your baby unless that s something you really want though you should give your baby the time it needs that doesn t mean you should be holed up in your house with your baby get out of the house as much as you can it ll be better for you and your baby even if you feel that one day with your newborn baby is 100 hours long you ll soon see that your baby will be over the newborn stage before you know it people debate whether babies stop being newborns after 28 days or up to 3 months so be prepared for all of the emotions you will feel intense joy at seeing your baby a fear that you may not be doing everything right a panic that you have lost your independence an isolation from your childless friends all of these feelings are perfectly natural and any hesitations or fears you have will fade to the background as you embark on a new life with your baby

query	200	inspect your suspension system you can often tell if there s an issue with your suspension just by the way it feels as you drive but it can be difficult to assess any issues without jacking up the vehicle and visually inspecting the components of the suspension yourself there are a number of different types of suspensions you may find in your vehicle but some things to look for are fairly universal identifying signs of suspension issues going over your front suspension inspecting your rear suspension conducting a bounce test pay attention if your ride begins to feel rougher take note if your vehicle pulls or squeaks during turns inspect the tread wear on your tires try braking abruptly to see if the nose dives as you stop look to see if the vehicle sits level pay attention to swaying and bouncing at low speeds visually inspect your strut mounts or shock towers measure the ride height on your front wheels jack up the vehicle visually inspect grease boots and rubber bushings for signs of damage check for excess play in the tie rod ends jack up the rear of the car wipe each joint clean and inspect the bushings for damage inspect bolts and nuts for rust and tightness inspect one wheel at a time with an independent rear suspension park your vehicle on firm even ground push down firmly on the front of the vehicle count how many bounces the suspension needs to recover repeat the test on the rear of the vehicle over time components of your suspension can wear out while visually inspecting components can often let you know if they ve become compromised the easiest way to determine if you are having a suspension issue is by paying attention to how the ride in your vehicle feels if it has become progressively rougher it is likely because the suspension is no longer absorbing the bumps the way it is supposed to if you begin to feel more bumps and shakes as you drive there may be an issue with your suspension sometimes a rougher ride will come coupled with audible squeaks as the suspension struggles to manage bumps in the road if you begin to feel as though the vehicle is working against you as you turn it is likely the result of a failing suspension component different parts of your suspension can affect the steering response angle of the tires and the center of balance of the vehicle each of these elements can make your vehicle cumbersome or difficult to turn a bad tie rod end will make steering response sluggish if you re an audible creek while turning the wheel it may be the result of a bad lower ball joint conversely if you hear knocking as the weight transfers in the vehicle during a turn it may be caused by a bad sway bar end link pay attention to how the vehicle reacts as you turn and compare it to your previous experiences in the vehicle to assess if there is an issue listen carefully to see if components of your suspension are squeaking under pressure every vehicle behaves a little differently while turning so previous experiences with the vehicle can make assessing issues much easier your tires should wear fairly evenly across the width of the tread if you rotate your tires regularly they should be worn close to evenly throughout if you happen to notice the inside or outside of the tire is wearing at a faster rate than the rest it could be an issue with the camber of your wheels and tires camber is the term used to describe the angle the wheel sits in relation to the vehicle and road a vehicle with negative camber will wear the inside of the tires more quickly a vehicle with positive camber will wear the outsides of the tires more quickly camber is determined by your suspension components and wheel alignment if you are having issues with your front struts or shocks your suspension may struggle to keep the vehicle level under hard braking stop quickly in a safe area and pay attention to the front of your car if the nose of the vehicle dives or drops as you slow down it may be as result of bad shocks or struts if you can hear an audible clunk from the front of the vehicle as you brake there is either an issue with your control arm or sub frame bushing your suspension should be able to support the weight of your vehicle and keep it fairly level during most situations the front corner of your vehicle may also drop as you turn in the same direction this is caused by the same failure with the vehicle parked walk around it and visually assess how level it seems to be sitting if one side of the car rests higher than the other there are likely worn out or broken suspension components to blame it is not uncommon for the front of the vehicle to ride slightly lower than the rear in many vehicles such as pickup trucks but the vehicle should otherwise be level your vehicle should have no difficulty withstanding bumps in the road at low speeds if you go over a bump and feel your vehicle sway back and forth or bounce after passing the bump your suspension is struggling to support the weight of the vehicle your vehicle should be able to go over a bump and quickly regain composure at low speeds if your vehicle sways back and forth after going over a bump there is likely an issue with your suspension open the hood of your vehicle and look to either side the struts or shock towers will extend through the fender above each wheel and be secured with one or a series of bolts or nuts look the fasteners over and ensure they are not covered in rust and are not loose or otherwise compromised if your strut mounts or shock towers are not properly secured they cannot function properly rust can compromise the nuts and bolts holding parts in place as well as the parts themselves use a ruler or tape measure to determine the length of empty space between the top of the tire and the bottom of the fender well on the driver s side of your vehicle repeat the process on the passenger side and assess if there is a difference while a slight variation is okay a half inch or less the two should be fairly equal if they are not even the side that is lower is probably where the issue lies if they are even there still may be an issue with the suspension that affects both sides equally you will need to get under the vehicle to visually inspect the condition of your suspension system place a trolley or scissor jack beneath the vehicle at one of its designated jack points for the front end if you are unsure of where to locate your vehicle s jack points refer to your vehicle s owner s manual for clarification jack up the car until it s high enough to work beneath then place jack stands beneath the car to support its weight before beginning your visual inspection never work beneath a vehicle that is supported by a jack without jack stands once you are beneath your vehicle start at one wheel and look around at the rubber bushings separating metal components of your suspension from one another they are usually black though they may fade into grey over time there may be as many as forty individual bushings between components of your suspension though they are often round with a hole in the middle like a doughnut any time you find a piece of rubber in your suspension it is considered a bushing if you notice cracks or tears in any bushings they will need to be replaced once a rubber bushing begins to wear out it will allow more movement between suspension components than should be permitted resulting in altered suspension dynamics and likely making your ride rougher torn or missing bushings can seriously compromise your vehicle s ability to withstand bumps or even steer common bushing failures in your suspension may include sway bar end links at each end of the sway bar trail arm bushings a the axle pivot point on the vehicle or the bushings in the upper or lower control arms locate the power steering box and follow its arms toward the wheels if you are unsure where the power steering box is located in your vehicle refer to the service manual specific to the year make and model of your car or truck tie rod ends serve as the connection points between the steering box and the wheels so if the bushings become compromised it could result in dead spots in your steering and reduced handling ability if you have noticed a dead spot in your steering wheel it is likely the result of having too much play caused by a bad tie rod end a completely failed tie rod end can be extremely dangerous as it can prevent you from being able to control the vehicle replace tie rod ends before they become so worn out they fail completely locate the rear jack points for your vehicle and place a jack beneath it if the front of your vehicle is resting on jack stands you may leave it in the air but if you only have two jack stands you should lower the front end of the vehicle and use those stands to support the rear of it while you work while the vehicle s front wheels don t have to be on the ground to inspect the rear suspension you must place jack stands beneath the rear in order to climb under the vehicle if the front tires are on the ground place a wheel chock in front of them to ensure the vehicle can t shift forward while you jack it up or once it is on the jack stands the rear suspension has far fewer components than the front but they need to be inspected for the same signs of damage it is likely that a lot of mud and debris has gotten trapped by the rear suspension so you may need to wipe the bushings off with some water and a rag to be able to properly inspect them there is no need to wipe the joints and bushings down if you can easily see them look for the same signs of cracking or tearing in the rubber bushings check the nuts and bolts used to secure components of the suspension to one another and the vehicle for signs of excessive rust and to make sure they are tight use a screw driver to poke at the fastening hardware that appears rusty if bits of the rusted nut or bolt comes off as you poke at it the hardware will need to be replaced if you notice any of the nuts or bolts have become loose over time use an appropriate hand or socket wrench to tighten them again if portions of the frame or the suspension components themselves are too rusted you will need to take the vehicle to a mechanic to have it repaired if your vehicle came equipped with an independent rear suspension you will need to jack up each side of the vehicle to inspect the suspension on that side although you may not need to with some vehicle you should anticipate needing to remove the wheel and tire in order to access and inspect the suspension components inspect an independent rear suspension by looking for signs of damage on the bushings or excess rust on the fastening hardware or suspension components suspension components are designed to support the weight of the vehicle under load so you should not be able to move any by hand if you can move a component by hand it is either too loose or the bushing has gone bad in order to conduct a bounce test you need to remove any variables that could affect how the vehicle recovers from being bounced soft or uneven ground can affect how the vehicle sits giving you a less reliable outcome blacktop or concrete are the preferred surfaces to conduct this test on an uneven surface will shift the weight of the vehicle causing the suspension to respond differently than it would otherwise the bounce test requires that you compress the suspension of the vehicle and assess how it recovers in order to do so place both of your palms on a stable part of the front of the vehicle the hood will suffice and press down with all of your weight take your hands away and watch the vehicle as it rises again press on the hood near the very front of the car to prevent putting a dent in it if you are unable to put enough pressure on the vehicle to compress the suspension ask a friend to help after releasing the vehicle it should bounce back up and right itself in a single bounce if it bounces a few more times as it settles the shock absorbers in the front of your vehicle are likely bad even if you push down on the hood several times before releasing it it should still right itself with only one bounce once you have assessed the front suspension move to the rear of the vehicle and repeat the process by pressing down on the trunk lid like the front the rear suspension should be able to right itself after a single bounce if the vehicle bounces a few times before settling again take it to a professional to have the shock absorbers looked at do not press down on spoilers or fins as they are often made of fiberglass and will break under pressure

query	202	ski while the idea of skiing may inspire images of powdery snow gorgeous vistas and steamy hot chocolate it is important to remember that skiing is no walk in the park it is however a thrilling sport that can satiate anyone s need for an adrenaline rush if you ve always wanted to try out skiing but have not yet had the opportunity to do so this guide can help you get started keep in mind that while this article covers the basics of alpine downhill skiing it is not a substitute for actual lessons read on and then go enroll in a class to begin to have ridiculous amounts of snowy fun knowing the rules of the slope putting your skis on learning the basics testing out the bunny slope trying more advanced trails learn how to distinguish trail difficulty know that these difficulty ratings are only in comparison to other trails at the same resort know who has the right of way on the slope always stay in control when on the slope do not stop if you cannot be seen from above put on your ski boots separate your skis step into your skis learn how to take your skis off enroll in ski lessons learn how to walk in skis know which technique works best for you assume the basic skiing posture keep yourself from sliding in any direction learn how to stop learn how to turn learn how to fall learn how to use a chairlift start on the bunny hill ready yourself at the top go down the slope keep your weight in the correct place move on to more advanced trails start with your first beginner trail try skiing without using the pizza technique try your first intermediate trail stick with the intermediate trails for a while attempt a black diamond trail try skiing the moguls you can tell how hard a trail is by the symbol on the trail marker or ski map in north america trail difficulty is indicated as follows a green circle indicates an easy or beginner trail these trails are not too fast will contain few obstacles and aren t too long these trails also don t have a very steep grade a blue square indicates an intermediate trail it may contain some obstacles or steeper grade and you shouldn t go on these until you ve mastered the easier trails a black diamond indicates a difficult trail it may contain obstacles moguls small hills of snow and a steep grade with a narrow way down don t attempt a trail like this if you are inexperienced although you might think you are ready you probably aren t many people have been injured by attempting too difficult a run too early a double black diamond or a black diamond with an exclamation mark in it indicates a run that should only be attempted by very good skiers don t go down a run like this unless you are completely comfortable with all other kinds of runs it s also a good idea to go with a partner once you are ready for a double black be sure it does not have ex in the middle this indicates an expert only trail the only thing harder than is heli skiing where they drop you off in helicopters these slopes are very avalanche prone therefore a run marked with a blue square at one resort may be more challenging than a run marked with a black diamond at another resort for this reason when skiing at a new resort you should always begin with a green run and work your way up even if you are an accomplished skier people ahead of you meaning down the slope from you have the right of way it is your responsibility to avoid them even if they fall right in front of you because of this it is best to keep a fair amount of distance between you and the skier or snowboarder in front of you it is your responsibility to know what speed and slope difficulty you can handle do not go on a black diamond simply because you think you are a natural born skier but have never actually skied before you run the risk of seriously injuring or even killing someone else or yourself if you crash while it is common to stop and catch your breath on the slope it s very dangerous to stop if you obstruct the trail or cannot be seen by someone coming down the trail people coming down the slope could crash into you if you do feel the need to stop try to stop at the top of the next section of the slope that s visible from above like the crest of a hill or pull over to the side of the run if you are renting your boots ask an attendant to help you figure out which boot is best for you you ll need to find the right size and adjust the tightness at rest your foot should be be essentially immobile but not compressed your toes should not press against the front of the boot when you bend your knees to point your shins slightly forward at the angle of the boot the top of the boot should be snug around your ankle it s easiest to walk in ski boots by taking long steps smoothly rolling the stiff boot bottom forward heel to toe with your lower leg straight as your body passes over once you have your boots on carry your skis and poles out to the snow the skis have edges with sharp angles that might have rough or sharp spots so carry them with gloves your skis might be locked together bottom to bottom by the clip like snow brakes extending from the bindings past the flat sides their purpose is to keep the skis from sliding away when they pop off your boots during a fall which protects your knees from excessive twisting they also make a pair of skis easier to carry find a flat area in the snow set the pair of skis upright on their back end hold down the one with its brake inside and gently shake and wiggle off the one with its brake outside set the skis pointing in the same direction about a foot apart many skis will work on either foot but check to see if your skis have any l or r markings on them and if so put them on the correct side stick your poles in the snow on each side of the skis a few inches to the side and next to the front edge of the binding hold onto the poles and one foot at a time tuck the flange at the boot s toe into the front binding and then push the flange at the boot s heel into the rear binding which should close with a click slide each foot back and forth a little to check that the ski has attached if it hasn t try again to take off a ski or to reset its latch to retry a failed mounting or if it fails to reset itself after detaching from your boot during a fall push down the lever behind the boot so that it is parallel to the ski this is most easily pushed with a pole by putting the spike into the indentation if you fall and have trouble righting yourself take off the ski on your ground side the side that is flat on the ground right yourself with the other ski and poles and then remount the removed ski although this may not be a first option for everyone since they can be expensive and sometimes aren t fun it is arguably the fastest way to get the basics down look for beginners classes that are offered at skiing resorts and on the mountain it is best to enroll in a class weeks before you will go up to the mountains as they generally fill up quickly enroll in a class that fits your age group or else you may accidentally end up in a childrens ski class many resorts offer inexpensive and plentiful lift ticket rental and beginner group class packages you can generally show up and sign right up some have inexpensive novice and intermediate level group short classes running on a schedule throughout the day as well these are great for working out initial kinks as a refresher or to build confidence for bigger hills one of the first things you should learn is how to move around in skis you will end up walking in skis when you are getting to a lift or if you fall and have to get to a wayward ski among other instances one of the most common ways to move yourself over flat or uphill terrain is to keep the skis parallel and push yourself forward with the poles with both arms simultaneously stab the poles angled gently rearward into the snow beside you rotate your entire arms smoothly backward and repeat the angle lets you use your stronger shoulder muscles rather than your weaker forearm muscles to pull back pull one side more than the other to turn do not saw the skis back and forth as with a skiing exerciser or move arms alternately cross country skiinguses special hinged bindings to enable sweeping ski motion and wax to help pressure on part of the ski during part of the sawing motion move you forward this method is good for starting onto a downhill stretch because the skis are positioned parallel ready to go herringbone a technique named after the fish bone patterns the skis leave in the snow point your ski tips away from each other so they make a v shape and take small steps forward tilt the leading edge into the snow and push forward to prevent slipping back bend your knees and lean forward a little so you can use the stronger leg extension muscles to push yourself forward rather than the weaker leg rotation muscles to pass one ski after another under you you can climb hills this way spread the skis more the steeper the hill and if you begin to slide backwards use the poles to avoid falling over and keep them outside of the skis area so you don t trip on them you can also side step up an incline stand perpendicular sideways to the slope of the hill dig the uphill edges of your skis into the snow as with the herringbone and take small steps sideways keep the skis perpendicular to the slope at your point and use the poles to reduce unwanted forward or backward slipping as you work your way sideways up the hill skate skiing is fastest angle the skis as if to herringbone but allow yourself to slide forward smoothly on one close to directly under you and transition to gently digging it in sideways and kicking it outward as you place the other ski under you on the other side maintaining forward momentum much as with ice skating you ll smoothly transition to herringbone movement on steep surfaces the leg muscles are stronger than the arm muscles especially in women and untrained men so as a beginner try to use the herringbone and skate skiing techniques as much as possible to avoid prematurely tiring your upper body do not go up any hills until you are confident in basic movements with your skis bend your knees so your shins rest on the front of the boots and lean forward slightly the length of the skis will make falling forward unlikely leaning back though tempting when you re feeling out of control will not normally stop you and will actually make the skis even harder to control put your hands through the straps on the ski poles and hold the poles by your sides during most actual skiing you ll want them ready to be used but won t actually use them do not bend sharply forward ski racers often use the french egg position of hunching forward onto their thighs to minimize air resistance in straights but it keeps the hips from swiveling and the arms from swinging freely for balance or leveraging poles for turns spread the tips apart herringbone to stop sliding backwards and the backs apart wedge to stop sliding forwards the muscles for pushing the legs outward are much stronger than the ones for pushing them inwards so forcing the skis apart against gravity s force works while forcing them together just leads to uncomfortable splits point your skis together then push your heels out to form a wedge with an open point and the leading sides tilted slightly up into the oncoming snow this is known as the pizza wedge or snowplow after an old fashioned wedge shaped plow the wider you spread it the slower you go do not overlap the tips of your skis that tends to lead to a loss of control once you have mastered the pizza you can move on to a more advanced way of stopping this involves turning so that your skis are perpendicular to the downward slope of the hill turning is also an important part of skiing as well as stopping to turn all you have to do is point your feet and your skis in the direction you want to travel for a strong parallel turn push the outside ski away from the body keeping it parallel to the direction of travel you and your skis will turn for an extra smooth carved turn tilt the outside ski s ankle to bite its ski s inside edge into the snow and ride on a banked turn you should feel the ski cutting into the snow to generate the turning force rather than sliding sideways over the snow if you want to stop while turning keep your feet in the plow position and turn across and slightly up the hill you will come to a slow stop eventually you will be able to stop simply by turning and placing enough force against the snow that you come to a halt with your skis still in a parallel position a very quick parallel turn of the skis before the body s motion has a chance to catch up to their new orientation followed by pressure on the uphill ski to dig them into the snow results in a hockey stop this takes practice if you are about to crash into a tree or another person and are a beginner don t try to swerve as you will probably hit something else instead just fall to your side when possible fall uphill as you are much less likely to get injured when you fall uphill your distance to fall is smaller and your skis stay downhill from your body try to absorb a fall with your hip and shoulder do not try to catch yourself with your arms as you are much more likely to injure your arm that you are to injure your hip or shoulder try to stay as relaxed as possible when you fall if you feel yourself falling try not to tense up or you will probably do more damage to yourself when you tense up your muscles become tight and you are much more likely to pull something ski walk up to the chairlift if you have poles be sure to take the straps off your wrist and safely hold both poles in one hand or under one arm keeping your poles on your wrists could be dangerous and will make it much more challenging to get on the lift wait until the operator says it s your turn and then quickly move into the loading area once there look over your shoulder to watch the chair coming around as it approaches you can optionally grab the side pole or back of the chair to steady yourself then simply sit down and allow it to pick you up lifts usually have room for two four or even six people per chair so make sure you and your friend are side by side when the chair approaches enjoy the view but do not ever lean over the edge of the chair while you are in the air even if your ski or a mitten falls off you will be able to get it later leaning too far out of the lift could cause you to fall which almost always results in serious injury and can occasionally lead to death when your chair reaches the top point your skis forward and push away from the chair as it goes around use the movement of the chair to propel you up and away from the lift if you fail to get off the chairlift at the supposed point do not panic and do not try to jump down you will trip a switch which will stop the lift and somebody will help you down a bunny hill is defined as a small slope preferably with a rope tow go up the carpet lift rope tow or chairlift to the top of the bunny hill a carpet lift is a big conveyor belt in one arrangement you push yourself forward onto the leading edge ride it most of the way with your poles on the belt ready to brace yourself on them against a sudden stop usually caused by a child s or beginner s error several feet from the end lift your poles to avoid jamming the end mechanism and lean gently forward to smoothly ski to a halt off the end of it if it is a rope tow wait until a handle comes around grab it and allow the rope to pull you up do not drag yourself or sit on the rope tow when the rope pulls you to the top let go and use the herring board to get away from the lift watch out for others especially if the bunny slope is at the foot of another slope from which other skiers may come in fast allow yourself to begin sliding down the slope but go slowly keep your skis pointed together once you reach the bottom point the skis toward each other and make a wide angle this will stop you fairly quickly if you fall point the skis so they point across the slope not down it push yourself up orient yourself and continue down the slope for your first few times going down the hill you may want to stay in the pizza position which gives you the most control after you have done the bunny hill a few times you will likely begin to want to turn to do this shift your weight onto the ski that is not in the direction you want to turn pushing against it tends to swing your body sideways behind it so that it continues now at an angle cutting against the snow in front of you lean into and dig the ski edges into a turn a little to make it sharper plan ahead curves will be wide at first give obstacles plenty of space once you know how to do this you can go down the hill in a curved kind of zigzag look ahead if you re looking directly down at your skis while going down a run you could hit a tree another person or anything else that might block your path if you lean too far back you will have a very hard time turning which may cause you to lose control and crash if you lean too far forward your skis will get squirrelly and you may wipe out a good technique is to keep your knees slightly bent and keep your hands in front of you like you re holding a lunch tray once you have mastered the bunny hill that is you can ride the lift walk on the flat part ski down turn both ways and stop with ease you should be ready to try a beginner hill consult with your instructor see if he or she thinks you are ready and then get ready for the rest of the mountain consult the ski map to find a suitable trail it should be close to the base area try to find a green run that starts at the top of a lift and ends at the base area or a series of trails that are all green ride up the lift and start on the trail as you go down more runs you should learn to ski without using the technique that keeps you moving slowly once you become accustomed to skiing the green trails try putting your skis parallel to each other for parts of the slope parallel skiing will cause you to go faster instead of going back into pizza turn across the mountain to control your speed instead of using the pizza technique try using the parallel stopping technique stopping parallel will make you stop faster and have more control before selecting a trail make sure you know how to turn and stop these skills will be very important select a trail that starts at the top of a lift and ends at the base area or select a path made up of blue and green trails while going down the intermediate trail you may notice it is steeper and you will probably wipe out a little more don t worry about this with practice these trails will become easier there are generally more intermediate trails than any other kind of trail this is your chance to really get comfortable on your skis practice all of the techniques listed above enjoy yourself explore all of the intermediate trails and find the one you like best then go down it multiple times skiing on these trails is when this activity can become dangerous always ski with caution by now you have probably left the pizza far behind and are now using parallel skiing and hopefully turning to make your way down the mountain if you are not yet at this stage please stick to the intermediate trails because you can get hurt and disturb other experienced skiers if you try to start hard trails too soon you should also learn to turn with the edges of your skis as you advance if you do find yourself on a trail that you think you can t handle then by all means ask somebody to get the ski patrol they will most likely give you a courtesy ride down in a toboggan also don t be afraid to ask any of the ski patrol or other mountain staff if you have any questions about any particular trail or the mountain as a whole moguls are large mounds of snow that are created on certain runs only more advanced skiers should try a mogul run out as they can be very challenging to get through without falling many times when going down a mogul run you want to curve up and around the mounds to control yourself try to turn up the mountain every time you round a mogul as you get more comfortable with the moguls you can begin to point your skis down the slope which will cause you to travel more quickly down and around the moguls

are used in commercial dishwasher soaps you may feel torn between convenience and safety fortunately you can make your own homemade dishwasher detergent using natural ingredients that you can buy at most grocery stores best of all whipping up your own dishwasher soap is actually cheaper than buying premade formulas so you ll save money at the same time making basic dishwasher detergent on the spot mixing up borax based dishwasher detergent creating borax free dishwasher detergent forming homemade dishwasher tabs add regular dish soap to the dishwasher s detergent cup fill the cup with baking soda top off the cup with salt run the dishwasher as you normally would combine the borax washing soda citric acid and kosher salt place in a jar or jug with a lid fill the detergent cup in your dishwasher with the mixture mix the citric acid washing soda baking soda and sea salt place the mixture in a jar use the detergent mixture as you would premade detergent combine all of the ingredients in a bowl fill two ice cube trays with the mixture allow the tabs to dry for a day store the tabs in an airtight container use one tab per dishwasher load if you find out that you re out of dishwashing detergent when the dishwasher s already full start by adding three or four drops of regular dishwashing soap to the dishwasher s detergent cup any brand or type of dish soap will work as long as it s a liquid if you re cleaning a particularly dirty load of dishes you may want to bump the soap up to four or five drops after you ve placed the dish soap in the washer s detergent cup add baking soda you ll want to pour enough baking soda into the detergent cup to fill it up approximately full to avoid spilling baking soda all over the interior of the dishwasher use a spoon to carefully fill the detergent cup rather than pouring the baking soda straight from the box once the dish soap and baking soda are in the detergent cup reach for a container of regular table salt add enough salt to the dish soap and baking soda mixture to completely fill the detergent cup if you only have sea or kosher salt you can substitute either for the table salt when you ve completely filled the detergent cup with the mixture close the compartment set and run your dishwasher as you usually do and when the cycle is done you ll have clean sparkling dishes without any suds overflow not only is this dishwasher detergent easy to make it s cheaper than store bought versions most people usually have dish soap baking soda and salt in their kitchen so it s a convenient alternative to the usual

query	206	eat marmite it s a food that s so famously polarizing even its official website asks visitors whether they love it or hate it 1 marmite a yeast extract popular in britain and several commonwealth countries is very much an acquired taste whether you re a dyed in the wool marmite fanatic or someone who s just trying to figure out how to survive eating the stuff there are tons of tips tricks and recipes you can use to make the most of your marmite experience with the right eating strategies you may even start to gain an appreciation for it surviving marmite s taste using marmite in recipes making a marmite centered meal spread marmite very sparingly mix marmite with butter or another spread to dilute the taste take small bites take big drinks with each bite try not to smell marmite before you eat it pair marmite with strong tasting foods to minimize its taste add marmite to soups and stews for savory flavor pair marmite with cheeses use marmite as a glaze for roast meats use marmite sparingly on spaghetti hard boil two eggs prepare the vegetables make toast plate your ingredients with marmite in the middle enjoy the marmite experience to the fullest in britain and other places where marmite is popular it s often eaten as a spread on toast crackers and other baked bread products since marmite has such a strong salty yeasty taste it s usually eaten in small quantities even by its fans if you re using your marmite as a spread rather than using a full spoonful of it like you might for jam or peanut butter instead use a tiny pea sized amount like you would for toothpaste ideally when you spread this tiny amount of marmite on your bread it should leave a paper thin layer of marmite just enough to discolor the bread you don t want any noticeable thickness to the marmite as this will give a seriously overpowering taste one of the most common ingredients to combine with marmite is butter especially when the marmite is being used as a spread butter s rich smooth taste pairs well with the strong salty flavor of marmite if you hate marmite try applying a generous helping of butter to your bread before or after you spread on the marmite the more you use the less you ll taste the marmite to many this makes marmite much more palatable getting used to eating marmite is like the old saying about how to boil a frog if you drop a frog into a pot of hot water it will jump out but if you drop it into a pot of lukewarm water and slowly increase the heat it won t know anything s wrong until it s too late rather than trying to wolf down your marmite in a few huge bites instead take small nibbles to begin gradually as you make progress the strong salty taste should become more bearable if you re having a hard time swallowing even small bites of your marmite spread try moving each bite carefully to the back of your mouth so that you can swallow it without much chewing this should minimize the amount you have to taste the marmite but be careful you ll need to take small bites to be able to swallow them without choking to keep the overpowering taste of marmite under control try taking a drink after each bite of marmite you take the drink will act as a chaser the more you sip the less you ll taste the marmite and the quicker the taste will leave your mouth plain ordinary tap water is a good zero calorie chaser but if you really hate the taste of marmite you may want to consider a stronger tasting beverage after each bite try drinking a swig of your favorite soft drink or if you re old enough a stiff cocktail the strong flavors of these beverages should help drown out the marmite taste the senses of taste and smell closely interact with each other to produce the effect that you experience when eating food the way something smells can affect the way it tastes to you and vice versa if you hate the taste of marmite there s a very good chance you won t care for its smell either in this case try your hardest not to smell the marmite as you eat it usually the taste though still strong will be a little less intense if you make an effort to hold your breath until the marmite has been swallowed or nearly so perhaps the single easiest way to make marmite more manageable is to simply not make it the central feature of your dish pairing marmite with other foods especially ones with distinctive powerful flavors of their own can make it much more palatable though you may never enjoy marmite by itself you may even find that you enjoy it when paired with other foods or used as a minor ingredient in a large recipe there s no wrong way to eat marmite any food you enjoy it with is fair game just a few foods that some marmite fans enjoy pairing their favorite yeasty spread with are eggs cheese meat seafood apricots marmalade and more in the next section we ll explore a few more flavorful marmite combinations feel free to use any of them as you see fit or make your own in small quantities marmite can give soups stews and other hearty liquid dishes a rich savory flavor and also works great as a browning agent for instance try mixing a spoonful of marmite into a pot of french onion soup in place of beef stock the flavor of the finished soup goes great with bread and cheese just like ordinary marmite in general you can usually get away with substituting marmite mixed with water your favorite vegetables and a little oil for beef broth this can allow you to make great tasting vegetarian versions of all your favorite carnivorous soups and stews many marmite fans agree the spread pairs deliciously with a wide variety of cheeses sharp cheddar is an especially great choice the salty yeasty flavor of the marmite enhances the sharpness of the cheese making for a bold flavored but tasty combination try adding a few slices of cheese to standard marmite and butter toast for a satisfying breakfast though it may sound odd marmite can be a tasty ingredient to include in glazes and sauces for meat dishes used correctly marmite can give the outer crust of roasted meats poultry and seafood a rich distinct umami savory flavor try painting a light mixture of melted butter and marmite over a whole roasted chicken for a savory treat you should only need a spoonful or two to cover it if you use marmite as a meat glaze you may want to forego sprinkling salt from the salt shaker on your meat especially if you need to be careful about your sodium intake marmite has a very high salt content it s more than 10 salt by mass believe it or not some people not only eat their spaghetti with marmite they love it if you re willing to experiment try adding a half teaspoon of marmite to al dente noodles along with a small helping of olive oil you may want to avoid using fine tomato sauces or cheeses to top your dish until you re positive that you enjoy it note that some fans of this recipe describe the flavor as being similar to the british snack food twiglets if you ve recently gained an appreciation for marmite and you re looking to expand your repertoire try this marmite centered sampler dish which works as a hearty meal on its own and scales easily for larger groups start by boiling a few eggs in a pot of water until they re hard boiled depending on the size of the eggs this should take about eight to ten minutes run cold water over the eggs after they re done cooking cooling them down halts the cooking process and prevents them from overcooking next let s get our vegetables ready for the marmite wash a bell pepper a handful of cherry tomatoes a cucumber a carrot and a few clumps of broccoli under running water cut each into small bite size pieces any shapes that look appealing are fine but for efficiency s sake you ll probably want to julienne your bell pepper cut it into skinny strips and take thin circular slices from your cucumber finally make a few golden brown slices of marmite s most well known companion dish you can use white wheat or even specialty breads like sourdough and rye here it s up to you when the toast is ready butter it as noted above butter and marmite pair quite well together arrange your vegetables eggs and toast in a circle around the outside of a large plate open a jar of marmite and place it in the center of the dish don t forget to peel your hard boiled eggs if you d like to use them to hold marmite like crackers cut the eggs into quarters or eights to make skinny curved slices using a butter knife put small portions of marmite on each piece of vegetable or egg before biting in you can eat the toast without marmite as a chaser to ready your mouth for the next bit piece of marmite or if you re bold just spread a tiny dollop of marmite on each piece of bread if you want to you can even dip your foods directly into the jar of marmite be careful it s easy to get more marmite than you intended this way 
query	207	make a diet coke and mentos rocket dropping mentos into a bottle of diet soda causes a physical reaction as they fall through the soda the mentos candies break the bonds between the carbon dioxide and water the combination that makes soda fizzy releasing the carbon dioxide gas up and out of the bottle 1 by closing the lid after adding mentos to a bottle of diet soda you trap that gas creating pressure when the bottle falls hard against the ground the cap flies off and the pressure releases launching the bottle up into the air preparing your materials making the mentos cartridge loading and launching the rocket having fun with it buy 1 2 liter bottle of diet coke buy 1 package of mentos obtain one roll of masking tape buy protective goggles find a wide open space to build the rocket in wear appropriate attire gather your materials cut 2 4 inch 10 2 centimeter strips of masking tape remove 5 to 7 mentos from the roll lay the mentos on to one of the 4 inch 10 2 centimeter strips of tape place the other 4 inch 10 2 centimeter strip of tape on top of the mentos cut a 3 inch 7 62 centimeter strip of masking tape and roll it around your finger sticky side out attach the rolled tape to the top of the mentos fasten the mentos cartridge into the bottom of the diet coke cap double tape the cartridge to the cap twist the loaded cap on to the diet coke bottle shake the bottle launch it try again enjoy the show clean up after yourself try different amounts of mentos combine mint and fruit mentos in one cartridge make a larger rocket make it a contest for the purposes of this example we re using diet coke but you can actually use any type of diet soda as long as it contains aspartame warm soda causes better explosions so avoid using cold refrigerated soda for best results purchase room temperature soda and then let it sit outside in the sun or in a pot full of hot not boiling water for a few hours before using it experiments have shown that while the original mint mentos will give you a longer explosion mentos fruit will give you slightly shorter but more intense explosion other experiments have shown that mint mentos are the better choice because the gum arabic found in the mint coating reduces surface tension and quickens the carbon dioxide s escape from the bottle making for a more intense explosion as the rocket is more of a fast acting affair you might want to go for mint mentos if you have the time and money to do so why not try one bottle with mint mentos and one with fruit mentos and then compare the results you probably have this one lying around your house already but if you don t you should be able to buy a roll just about anywhere hardware stores are a safe bet wearing goggles will not only protect your eyes from the soda mentos concoction but also from any other debris for example the lid that might fly out from the bottle once it hits the ground and explodes your rocket is likely to bounce around like crazy make sure it has enough room to do that if you re in a parking lot make sure there are no cars nearby for at least a 50 foot radius if not more if there s a field or empty lot nearby go there to make your rocket you don t want to risk doing damage to anyone s car or home as it could cost you or your parents a lot of money to repair it s possible you ll get covered in the sticky diet coke mentos solution wear clothes and shoes that you don t mind getting wet and sticky preferably ones that are easy to wash bring your 2 liter bottle of diet coke your pack of mentos your masking tape and your safety goggles to wherever you ve decided to build your rocket place the strips of tape on a flat surface with their sticky sides facing up do not allow them to stick together the more mentos you use the better the explosion however you don t want to the mentos to dip too far into the diet coke otherwise the explosion may begin before you can screw the lid on the bottle they should look just as they did when they were still in their original packaging stacked on top of one another like a roll of coins be sure to leave the sides of the mentos exposed you ll use this piece to attach the mentos to the bottle cap so ensure that it s small enough to fit inside the cap take the 3 inch strip of sticky rolled tape that you ve just created and attach it to the top of the taped roll of mentos this will create a loaded mentos cartridge that you can place inside the diet coke bottle put the cap on a flat surface with its inside facing upwards place the mentos cartridge sticky tape side up into the soda cap and press down to fasten it there be careful not to press too hard as you don t want any mentos falling out of the cartridge this step is optional if you re worried about the mentos prematurely falling into the diet coke you can secure the cartridge by running one more piece of masking tape around the entire roll including the cap the cap should be securely on the bottle but not closed too tightly if it s closed too tightly the cap might not come off when you throw the bottle and the rocket won t work as you twist the cap on you ll also want to make sure that the mentos do not touch the diet coke yet if it seems like the mentos will touch the diet coke you can either dump a small amount of diet coke out before screwing the cap on redo your mentos cartridge to contain fewer mentos or you can try your luck and screw the cap on as quickly as possible shake it so that the mentos fall into the diet coke and then keep shaking do this for at least a few seconds there are several different methods for launching your rocket a popular and effective one is to throw the bottle high up into the air and let it fall on to the ground preferably hard ground like cement this is the best method if you re worried about getting hit by the rocket as you can throw it far away from you and even run in the opposite direction another method is to throw the bottle at a side angle so that when it hits the ground the ground knocks off its cap yet another method is to throw the bottle at more of a 90 degree angle cap first on to the ground you can skip this step if your rocket works right away if the rocket doesn t go off when you throw it pick it up and try unscrewing the cap a little before throwing it again just be careful not to unscrew the cap too far otherwise you re likely to end up covered in diet coke when the bottle hits the ground its cap should fly off and the diet coke mentos solution will shoot out of the bottle s opening this should cause the bottle to fly high up into the air depending on how you throw it the bottle might also bounce around sporadically for several seconds side angle launches generally seem to cause the bottle to bounce low and skid along the ground vertical launches in which you throw the bottle straight up into the air and let it fall to the ground tend to give the rocket more height as it shoots upward if the bottle is still full of diet coke and mentos but it s stopped moving on the ground you can try to launch it again to see if it has any more flight left in it once you ve finished your experiment don t forget to pick up after yourself clean up any bits of tape or mentos packaging that might have dropped to the ground as you built your rocket and pick up the rocket clean out the bottle and put it in the recycling bin or bring it to the bottle depot the more mentos the better the explosion experiment with putting different amounts of mentos into the diet coke bottle to see what yields the best explosion studies have shown that mint and fruit mentos yield different explosions try mixing them together in one cartridge and adding them to your diet coke bottle to see what sort of explosion they cause when they are mixed together fill an empty 4 liter milk jug with 4 liters 2 two liter bottles of diet coke leave enough room at the top to add at least an 8 mento cartridge as with the original rocket recipe stick the mentos cartridge to the lid of the milk jug fasten the lid shake the container to release the mentos into the diet coke then throw the jug high up into the air and let it hit the pavement hard get together with your friends and each make your own rocket set up a flag or some other way of measuring height and have a judge watch and name the winner 
query	208	determine gear ratio in mechanical engineering a gear ratio is a direct measure of the ratio of the rotational speeds of two or more interlocking gears as a general rule when dealing with two gears if the drive gear the one directly receiving rotational force from the engine motor etc is bigger than the driven gear the latter will turn more quickly and vice versa we can express this basic concept with the formula gear ratio t2 t1 where t1 is the number of teeth on the first gear and t2 is the number of teeth on the second 1 finding the gear ratio of a gear train two gears more than two gears making ratio speed calculations start with a two gear train count the number of teeth on the drive gear count the number of teeth on the driven gear divide one teeth count by the other start with a gear train of more than two gears divide the teeth numbers of the drive and driven gears if desired find the gear ratios for the intermediate gears find the rotational speed of your drive gear plug your information into the formula s1 t1 s2 t2 solve to be able to determine a gear ratio you must have at least two gears engaged with each other this is called a gear train usually the first gear is a drive gear attached to the motor shaft and the second is a driven gear attached to the load shaft there may also be any number of gears between these two to transmit power from the drive gear to the driven gear these are called idler gears for now let s look at a gear train with only two gears in it to be able to find a gear ratio these gears have to be interacting with each other in other words their teeth need to be meshed and one should be turning the other for example purposes let s say that you have one small drive gear gear 1 turning a larger driven gear gear 2 one simple way to find the gear ratio between two interlocking gears is to compare the number of teeth the little peg like protrusions at the edge of the wheel that they both have start by determining how many teeth are on the drive gear you can do this by counting manually or sometimes by checking for this information labeled on the gear itself for example purposes let s say that the smaller drive gear in our system has 20 teeth next determine how many teeth are on the driven gear exactly as you did before for the drive gear let s say that in our example the driven gear has 30 teeth now that you know how many teeth are on each gear you can find the gear ratio relatively simply divide the driven gear teeth by the drive gear teeth depending on your assignment you may write your answer as a decimal a fraction or in ratio form i e x y in our example dividing the 30 teeth of the driven gear by the 20 teeth of the drive gear gets us 30 20 1 5 we can also write this as 3 2 or 1 5 1 etc what this gear ratio means is that the smaller driver gear must turn one and a half times to get the larger driven gear to make one complete turn this makes sense since the driven gear is bigger it will turn more slowly as its name suggests a gear train can also be made from a long sequence of gears not just a single driver gear and a single driven gear in these cases the first gear remains the driver gear the last gear remains the driven gear and the ones in the middle become idler gears these are often used to change the direction of rotation or to connect two gears when direct gearing would make them unwieldy or not readily available let s say for example purposes that the two gear train described above is now driven by a small seven toothed gear in this case the 30 toothed gear remains the driven gear and the 20 toothed gear which was the driver before is now an idler gear the important thing to remember when dealing with gear trains with more than two gears is that only the driver and driven gears usually the first and last ones matter in other words the idler gears don t affect the gear ratio of the overall train at all when you ve identified your driver gear and your driven gear you can find the gear ratio exactly as before in our example we would find the gear ratio by dividing the thirty teeth of the driven gear by the seven teeth of our new driver 30 7 about 4 3 or 4 3 1 etc this means that the driver gear has to turn about 4 3 times to get the much larger driven gear to turn once you can find the gear ratios involving the idler gears as well and you may want to in certain situations in these cases start from the drive gear and work toward the load gear treat the preceding gear as if it were the drive gear as far as the next gear is concerned divide the number of teeth on each driven gear by the number of teeth on the drive gear for each interlocking set of gears to calculate the intermediate gear ratios in our example the intermediate gear ratios are 20 7 2 9 and 30 20 1 5 note that neither of these are equal to the gear ratio for the entire train 4 3 however note also that 20 7 30 20 4 3 in general the intermediate gear ratios of a gear train will multiply together to equal the overall gear ratio using the idea of gear ratios it s easy to figure out how quickly a driven gear is rotating based on the input speed of the drive gear to start find the rotational speed of your drive gear in most gear calculations this is given in rotations per minute rpm though other units of velocity will also work for example let s say that in the example gear train above with a seven toothed driver gear and a 30 toothed driven gear the drive gear is rotating at 130 rpms with this information we ll find the speed of the driven gear in the next few steps in this formula s1 refers to the rotational speed of the drive gear t1 refers to the teeth in the drive gear and s2 and t2 to the speed and teeth of the driven gear fill in the variables until you have only one left undefined often in these sorts of problems you ll be solving for s2 though it s perfectly possible to solve for any of the variables in our example plugging in the information we have we get this 130 rpms 7 s2 30 finding your remaining variable is a matter of basic algebra just simplify the rest of the equation and isolate the variable on one side of the equals sign and you will have your answer don t forget to label it with the correct units you can lose points for this in schoolwork in our example we can solve like this 130 rpms 7 s2 30910 s2 30910 30 s230 33 rpms s2in other words if the drive gear spins at 130 rpms the driven gear will spin at 30 33 rpms this makes sense since the driven gear is much bigger it will spin much slower

now an international sensation it is delicious right out of the jar but every day brings a new way to enjoy this wonderful spread using nutella as a spread pairing nutella with fruit baking with nutella getting creative with nutella spread nutella on a slice of plain white bread top your waffles with it make mini nutella sandwiches spread nutella on bacon make a fruit tray with a nutella dip make fruit shish kabobs with a nutella drizzle use nutella as a sauce for grilled pears make cookies with nutella swirl nutella in banana bread make nutella brownies make a no bake s more with nutella filling make nutella hot chocolate make a nutella grilled cheese sandwich make a grilled cinnamon sugar and nutella snack use nutella in icecream this is probably the most common way to enjoy nutella and certainly one of the simplest aside from eating it straight off the spoon which is perfectly acceptable try it on a nice crusty baguette it s also tasty on a toasted bagel enjoy it with crepes as a quick online search will tell you waffles and nutella is a popular breakfast it may not be healthy but it is guaranteed to to be satisfying try warming the nutella in the microwave for a few seconds take care not to microwave it in the plastic container it s hard to beat a warm chocolate hazelnut drizzle if you re looking for a quick snack try spreading nutella between two ritz crackers some people prefer the saltiness of a ritz cracker but you may use any cracker you like try spreading nutella on wafer cookies a lot like spreading nutella on crackers only a bit more indulgent certainly for those with a serious sweet tooth the ultimate combination of sweet and salty cook bacon to desired crispiness and let it cool warm the nutella over low heat while the bacon is cooling using a spatula and taking care not to break the bacon coat the bacon in nutella refrigerate to let the nutella set on the bacon enjoy nutella pairs well with almost any fruit slice an assortment of fruits try a mixture of bananas apples and berries toss the sliced fruit with a little lemon juice to keep them from browning arrange the sliced fruits on a tray in a ring leaving a space in the center of the tray for a bowl of nutella fruit dip add a few tablespoons of nutella to an 8 oz package of cream cheese and mix well you may want to add some powdered sugar if you find the cream cheese too tart pour the nutella fruit dip into a small bowl and place in the center of the tray slice a mixture of your favorite fruits into large chunks take the pieces of fruit and arrange them onto skewers so that each skewer has a nice mix of each fruit warm some nutella in a saucepan over low heat using a wooden spoon or spatula drizzle the warm nutella over each of the fruit shish kabobs and serve the sweetness of nutella pairs well with pears grilled in a light coating of salt and oil slice a few pears in half lengthwise and rub with a little salt and oil avoid oils with strong vegetable flavors such as olive oil instead try to use a neutral oil or a sweeter oil like coconut oil you can use an outdoor grill or cook indoors in a cast iron skillet or grill pan set the heat to medium low and cook pears until soft about 15 minutes remove pears from heat and drizzle with warm nutella serve immediately use nutella to spice up your favorite cookie recipe or try these nutella inspired cookies using hazelnut extract and cocoa if you are using nutella in an existing recipe be mindful of the additional fat being incorporated into the cookie dough try replacing some of the butter with nutella for example if you plan on adding 1 4 cup of nutella to a recipe that calls for 1 cup of butter try using 3 4 cup of butter instead once the cookie dough is fully mixed you can gently stir in a spoonful of nutella to create a nutella swirl nutella can also be used as a frosting for sugar cookies spread a layer of banana bread dough in the bottom of a loaf pan then using a spatula or the edge of a wooden spoon spread a layer of nutella on top of the dough and swirl it throughout making an s shape alternate layering dough and nutella swirling after each addition of nutella for a nice hazelnut flavored brownie try adding nutella to the dough add nutella with the other wet ingredients butter sugar eggs and fully incorporate as with the cookies be mindful of the added fat try swirling nutella through the brownie batter instead these s mores technically aren t baked but they are an excellent way to use nutella replace the chocolate bar normally used in s mores by spreading nutella on one side of a graham cracker grab another cracker and spread marshmallow fluff on it to avoid melting marshmallows over a campfire a wonderful way to get your s mores fix indoors when heating the milk for your hot chocolate simply add a spoonful of nutella whisk until fully incorporated and heated throughout slice a banana get some cream cheese you can also use any cheese that melts easily take two slices of bread and spread butter on one side of each slice spread cream cheese on one side of one slice spread nutella on one side of the other place banana slices between the two slices of bread heat a pan on the stove over medium heat place your uncooked nutella sandwich in the pan cook until warm throughout and bread is crusty enjoy heat a pan to medium or medium low spray the pan with cooking spray to ensure a non stick surface butter a slice of bread spread cinnamon sugar mix on the buttered side cook with the buttered side facing up until the cinnamon sugar melts into the slice remove with a spatula do this with care as the slice will be very hot flip over and grill the other side briefly this is optional it adds extra crunch remove from the heat spread nutella across the side without cinnamon sugar the heat will cause the nutella to ooze into the slice eat immediately as the bread slice is likely to be crispy after cooling eat with a fork when making ice cream add nutella in once you ve mixed the eggs and sugar together make sure the nutella is blended completely before adding milk to the mixture once the nutella ice cream mixture is complete follow your ice cream maker s instructions you can also use nutella as a topping for sundaes

to ask for help during an emergency luckily it is a simple short code that children can easily remember explain to your child what services they can reach when they call 911 for example explain the role of a police officer tell the child that a police officer can help if they think that there is some threat to their safety like someone breaking into the house etc explain the role of doctors paramedics tell the child that doctor or paramedics can help if someone is seriously injured in an accident if someone falls ill passes out etc explain the role of a fireman tell your child that the firemen can come in case of a fire a flood or if someone needs to be rescued from an unsafe situation explain to the child who the dispatcher is this is the person who receives the 911 calls from people who need help the dispatcher asks questions collects information and sends help tell your child that they should not be afraid to talk to this person the child needs to be made aware of the situations in which it s appropriate for them to make a 911 call these situations include when the child sees a fire smells smoke or the fire alarm is activated if the child witnesses a crime or believes that his or someone else s safety is endangered if the child was in an accident where people were injured or if they are injured themselves if someone is sick and needs medical help either on

calling however there are also situations where the child should stay exactly where they are for example if someone is sick or injured the child should stay with them let them know that the dispatcher who answers the 911 call can give them information on how to help the sick or injured person talk to your child about possible emergencies explain the possible situations in which a child should call 911 encourage your child to name all these situations ask questions such as what will you do when you see a car accident or what would you do if you were alone at home and see that mom is not well what if your friend fell hit his head and lost consciousness this will help your child to recognize the specific situations in which they might need to call 911 this preparation could be vital when it comes to an actual emergency the child must know their own address name last name and parents names explain that this is because the dispatcher will ask him who is calling what the emergency is and where it is located in order to send help if someone in the family suffers from a chronic illness and has frequent problems instruct the child to call 911 when they see certain symptoms write down the name of the disease or condition on a piece of paper and make sure the child knows where to find it in this way the child will be able to provide this vital information to the dispatcher which can be extremely helpful once the ambulance arrives teach your child how to describe their surroundings in case the emergency happens outside of the home and the child doesn t know where they are teach your child to look for stress signs or distinct characteristics of the buildings around them this will help the dispatcher to send an ambulance firetruck police car to the correct location as quickly as possible instruct your child not to panic when they are making the 911 call explain that they need to talk to the dispatcher as slowly and calmly as possible tell them to answer any questions that the dispatcher might have in order to give as much information as possible tell them to listen carefully to the dispatcher and to try to follow any instructions the dispatcher gives as closely as possible if the child does not wait until the end of the call they might miss out on providing or receiving vital information that could affect someone s life if your accidentally call 911 explain to them that they should not hang up tell them they should wait for the dispatcher to answer and then explain that there is no emergency otherwise the dispatcher may locate the call and send help where it is not needed wasting resources and potentially delaying help to someone who really needs it have at least one telephone that the child can easily reach and access all times it s no use teaching them how to call 911 if they can t get to a phone in case of emergency make sure your child knows how to use a cell phone and how to unlock it teach your child the password if you have one and show them how to get to the keyboard from the home screen older phones such as those at grandma s and grandpa s house may have a circular dialer if this is the case your should show your child how to call from such a phone a finger should be placed at the desired number and the dialer should be turned to the right all the way to the end explain to the child that 911 means nine one one never refer to it as nine hundred and eleven or nine eleven in a critical situation the child may lose time if they expect the phone s keyboard to have the number eleven or ninety one to younger children explain the difference between the numbers 6 and 9 point out that 9 has a circle which is above as its head and that 6 has a circle at the bottom like it s sitting on it this is the best way for children to learn and the best way to assess the skills of your child let the child wait for dial tone you can act it out or play a recording tone from another phone to prepare the child for how the tone sounds let the child act out calling 911 first the number 9 then 1 and then 1 again act the part of the dispatcher ask questions like who s calling where are you calling from and why teach your child to speak loudly get them to repeat information if they didn t say it loudly enough and encourage them to ask you the dispatcher to explain again if they aren t clear on the instructions you can make an appointment with a local dispatcher to do a practice call with your child call 911 and ask the dispatcher if he is free to practice with your child right now or if he need to make an appointment

windows open windows from the top instruct children not to play near windows do not rely on bug screens many windows have built in locks you can latch shut with a key to prevent the window from opening if your windows have keys built in this is your best option for baby proofing your windows if your windows do not have keys however use another method installing keys is costly and time consuming and it s far easier to use an alternative window locking method you should have window locks somewhere in your home if your windows have built in keys they were likely given to you when you bought your home if you re renting a building ask your landlord for the keys to your window locks you can also replace the lock barrels in the event you cannot find window keys you can find replacement barrels online or at a local hardware store how to replace lock barrels varies in terms of the type of lock used in your window barrels should come with manufacturer s instructions explaining how to install them if you re unsure how to replace lock barrels yourself hire a locksmith or handyman to do the work for you you want to make sure the barrels are replaced correctly as it s important to lock your windows for the safety of your child if you have windows that slide open a window stop is a handy plastic device you can use to stop windows from opening you can buy window stops at most hardware stores you can also purchase them online window stops are triangular shaped pieces of plastic that work by wedging the window shut in the indent where the window slides up and down you would wedge a window stop against the brim of the window this should prevent the window from being opened you want to make sure you get the right size window stop measure the length of the indent on your wall make sure the window is not wider than that indent you can have a window opened slightly with a window stop in place if you choose to open your window make sure the opening is no wider than four inches a child should not be able to fit between a gap of this size or less a charlie bar is another device you can use to keep sliding windows closed this is a metallic stick that fits between the top half of a wedged window and the portion of the window that slides up if your window opens sideways you can also fit a charlie bar into your window horizontally to keep it open keeping a charlie bar in place will prevent a child from opening a window keep in mind as your child grows older he or she may be able to stand and reach the charlie bar if your child is walking and getting taller consider a method other than a charlie bar crank windows are windows that can be opened by turning a small crank keeping cranked windows closed is very simple you can simply remove the crank for the most part the crank can be removed by simply twisting it off however you may need a screwdriver to remove some screws in some crank windows some windows are designed in an unusual fashion and do not follow the crank or sliding opening pattern luckily there is a method you can use that works for most windows you ll need the following supplies all of which can be purchased online or at a hardware store measuring tapevelcro stripgluelexan sheetif you cannot find a lexan sheet try another see through plastic or light glass someone at the hardware store should be able to point

dreary due to a window guard you will be attaching a lexan sheet inside your window using velcro in order to determine how big of a sheet you ll need measure your window vertically and horizontally write down these dimensions take your lexan sheet to a hardware store ask a worker to cut the sheet in the dimensions of your window as a lexan sheet is made of plastic it can be dangerous to attempt to cut it yourself unless you have experience working in hardware attach four strips of velcro along each side of your lexan sheet then attach four strips of velcro hooks along the side of your window use your glue to attach the velcro as a child is not very strong simple craft glue should be strong enough to keep your lexan sheet in place with very young children velcro should be strong enough to hold the windows in place also as the sheet is fit so tightly in the window it would be difficult for a child to get a grip on the lexan sheet to begin with if your children are older consider screwing the lexan sheet into the window frames if you re renting you should check with your landlord before drilling into the window once the glue has dried place your lexan sheet into the window it will now be hard for your child to slide or push open your window as there is a guard in place the advantage of lexan is that it also lets light through avoiding your room becoming dark due to a window guard if you want to let airflow in through the window consider drilling holes through the plastic with a power drill read the manufacturer s instructions on your lexan sheet first however to make sure you take proper safety precautions for the brand of lexan you re using window guards are metallic devices installed in the lower half of windows that slide open vertically they are usually barred devices designed to keep children from falling out of windows some states require window guards be installed under certain conditions window guards are usually required in public buildings however if you have a child under 10 living with you a window guard may be mandatory by law this varies by city and state you can check your state s government website to find out your state s regulations this is usually under the department of public safety a window guard is not easy to install some states may actually require professional installation an improperly installed window guard can easily be removed by a child the bars of a window guard are also prone to sloppy installation and can easily be installed in a way that would allow a child to fit through the guard while professional installation may sound costly to you it may actually not cost much at all your state may provide window guard installation for free or cheap if you re renting a building your landlord may be legally required to provide you with a window guard at no added cost once again check with your state s department of public safety window guards come in many shapes and sizes however you should make sure you choose a window guard that s safe for your type of window a safe window guard should be at least 15 inches tall the bars in the window guard should be close enough together that a 5 inch ball cannot pass through a window bar that does not meet these regulations is not considered safe it also may not legally count as a window guard by your state which could land you in legal trouble depending on your state s regulations some states such as new york have a list of approved window guard manufacturers you should check to see if your state has such a list before selecting a window guard when purchasing a window guard you should make sure the guard is safe for your specific type of windows somewhere on the ordering form or box containing the guard it should specify what type of window this guard is compatible with you can purchase a window guard online or at a local hardware store in order to be safe window guards should not come off easily one way screws installed with a philips head screwdriver are vital for the safe installation of window guards before having your guard installed pick up a handful of one way screws at a local hardware store it is not recommended that you install a window guard yourself window guards are complicated to install an faulty window guard is extremely dangerous as a child could slip and fall out of a window many states require professional installation call a local hardware store and ask if they do installation if they do not they may be able to direct you to a local business that installs household items like window guards always read reviews of any establishment you re doing business with ahead of time make sure customers were satisfied good service is especially vital when the safety of your children is at stake if you live in an apartment your landlord may be legally required to provide a window guard free of charge if you live with a child under 10 call your landlord and request a window guard be installed as

sliding windows can be opened from either the top or the bottom if you re able to open a window from the top do so it will be much harder for a baby to access the top of the window than the bottom just to be safe however keep the opening less than four inches teach your children to take proper precaution involving windows while many safety devices can reduce the chance of accidents there is always a slight risk such devices will fail therefore it s important that you keep your child away from the windows raise your voice gently to explain to deter your child when he or she is playing

query	213	make stained glass the term stained glass generally refers to the process of combining various shapes of already colored glass the color of stained glass comes from the addition of metallic salts during its manufacturing stained glass is prominently displayed in church windows as well as in certain styles of lampshades and mirrors creating stained glass objects requires some skill and precision but can be a fun project getting started making your stained glass avoiding common problems pick an easy beginning project pick a pattern pick a type of glass purchase your glass gather your equipment make your template score your glass cut your glass grind the edges foil the glass add flux to the copper foil solder the glass in place frame your creation deal with gaps between your pieces avoid problems with scoring your glass deal with problems while soldering if you re just starting out making stained glass you don t want to reach too far too quickly start with a smaller simpler pattern that doesn t require too many parts beginners might consider a simple panel to affix to a window for example you want a project that doesn t have too many sharp edges that doesn t have so many parts to keep track of a simple panel for your window can be a great start you want to find a pattern that you like and that your skill level will allow you to do consider things like how many glass pieces the pattern will need and how much cutting and soldering you re going to have to do if you re just starting out again it s best to pick a simpler pattern there are lots of free patterns out there you can get them on the internet in books from the library and so on the beauty of a pattern that s already available is that you don t have to figure out how it s going to work that work has already been done for you create your own pattern you could create your pattern based on something that you saw around you or a pattern that you saw somewhere like in a cathedral s stained glass window that you re trying to replicate on your own look for inspiration in books and in nature beginners should choose a pattern that is broad and simple such as a flower although be mindful of the curves and the sharp edges sheet glass is what you ll be using for this project it falls into two basic categories cathedral and opalescent you will also need to consider things like price texture color and degree of transparency stained glass comes in large sheets the smallest sheet is approximately 1 foot 0 3 m by 1 foot 30 48 cm by 30 48 cm with the largest being four times that size buy enough glass for the size of your project but keep in mind that about a quarter of what you buy will not be utilized after trimming cathedral glass tends to be a clear or transparent color it s composed of clear glass with colorants added this glass requires less pressure to cut throughopalescent glass incorporates white or opal glass into the color mix an opalescent blue is blue glass that is not entirely transparent for example opalescent glass tends to require more pressure to cut through because the opal of the glass creates a higher density than cathedral glass you can combine these two types together in your project if you want an interesting mix of clear and opaque keep in mind that they need slightly differently handling as evidenced by the pressure needed to cut through them there is also streaky glass which tends to be cathedral glass with streaks of opal mixed in the best place to get stained glass for your project is at a stained glass supply shop you can find both equipment for making stained glass as well as the stained glass itself you can also get stained glass at some of the larger hobby and craft stores but you ll get a better selection at a shop specific to stained glass most of the glass you buy comes in sheets about one square foot 30 cm and one eighth of an inch thick the sheet can be anywhere from 6 to 20 depending on the color and the detail in the glass the strength and brightness of the colors it can also depend on where the glass comes from glass that comes from europe is simply going to cost more this is often called antique glass even if it was made in modern times you ll need to gather some specific equipment for making your stained glass project you can find these items at most hobby or craft stores but especially at stained glass supply shops glass cutter there are lots of different glass cutters available the hand cutter has the best flexibility and accuracy in template cutting the pencil style cutter is great for beginners as well as those doing trace cutting because it has consistent pressure and control the pistol grip is great for cutting thick glass and is also a good choice for beginners whose hand strength isn t enough pliers ordinary house pliers shouldn t be used for this you ll need grozer pliers for breaking glass and nipping off edges as well as running pliers for snapping long cuts in the glass copper foil comes in a variety of widths depending on the width of your glass this is used to hold the glass pieces together through the adhesive on the one side if you re using cathedral glass clear glass the backing will be visible so make sure you re using the right color for your piece soldering iron and solder solder is a mixture of tin and lead the higher the tin content the lower the melting point which means it will flow more quickly and with a more silvery finish as for the soldering iron you ll need one that is designed for stained glass projects with a minimum of 75 watts the irons come with different sized tips depending on your project grinder if you don t have access to a grinder you can use a carborundum stone to grind down the edges of your glass after cutting if you can get a grinder the electric glass grinder is great for dealing with sharp edges quickly draw copy or print out your pattern on a piece of graph paper that s the actual size cut the pattern into its separate pieces and label them by color and grain direction place the pattern under the glass and trace the outline with a thin permanent marker leave a centimeter or less of room for the thickness of the copper foil between the pieces use either a specialty black pen or a permanent marker to mark the glass if you have access to a lightbox this can be incredibly helpful for tracing the pattern onto the glass hold the glass cutter between your thumb and your forefinger with the tip pressed between your forefinger and your middle finger press the cutter into the glass gently using a cork backed steel ruler to cut straight begin at a point away from your body and begin scraping inward make sure that you re applying the right amount of pressure you should hear a nice clear zzzzip as you score if you apply too little pressure the break will not follow the score line too much pressure and you ll cause unnecessary wear and tear on your cutter as well as your wrist and elbow move your pattern around rotating the glass as necessary to keep proper form make sure that the score line goes from edge to edge there are a few slightly different methods to cutting your glass depending on the size and the curve of the glass the goal of course is to cut the glass along the scored lines so that it breaks apart easily and leaves you with the shapes that you need for straight pieces as soon as you see a line forming place pliers in the crack and squeeze to separate the piece you can also hold the glass on either side of the break and snap it apart with your hands for curved sections use the glass cutter to break through the scoring don t worry if the piece breaks off slightly jagged you can remove edges later if you need to as long as you keep your curves gentle if you re dealing with deep curves deal with it in a series of shallow curves so that it won t break on its own once you ve cut all the different pieces it s time to grind down the sharp edges and make sure that everything is smooth you will want to grind away gently and patiently so that you don t chip any of the pieces put the pieces along the pattern again so that you can grind down the glass into corrective lines this will make sure that everything fits well together when you put the glass pieces together it s also a good idea to build a frame around the pieces when you ve finished grinding them and fitting them together this way the pieces won t slip when you re foiling the glass cover the edges of the glass with 7 32 inch copper foil make sure the foil is centered otherwise it can look a little funky at the end this can be done by hand or with a table foiler once you ve decided on the thickness of your copper foil you need to peel off the protective backing of the foil make sure that you center your glass correctly on the tape and press it securely along all the cut edges press the foil down hard with tongue depressor or other firm instrument this will ensure the foil adheres to the glass you will want to make sure that the tape is very securely adhered as well as even if a section gets bunched up tear it off and start again while flux helps the solder flow between the copper taped pieces it isn t one hundred percent necessary however it can make things easier for you in the long run brush each copper foiled surface with the flux before you solder each time the gel form is the easiest and most forgiving to use although you can also try out the liquid form soldering the glass takes a bit of time and patience there are several different things you need to do to make sure you re soldering properly you have to tack together your pieces then you have to tin the seams and finally you add the bead to tack all the pieces together apply small dots of flux to desired areas and melt a small blob of solder on top once you ve got all the pieces tacked together you can tin the seams to tin the seams you first add flux to all of the seams then apply a thin flat amount of solder to all of the seams make sure that you completely coat all of the copper foil apply a new layer of flux to the tinned seams then melt a larger amount of solder onto the seams run your soldering iron back and forth over to create a melted seam of solder once a section is completely melted you ll lift the iron up from your piece to create a smooth bead framing isn t absolutely necessary but it can create a nice finish to your piece you could use a zinc frame or a lead channel which requires more soldering exactly the same as the steps outlined above especially when you re a beginner you can screw up with cutting the glass or grinding it down this will leave you with gaps between your pieces compensate for these inaccuracies by filling the gaps between your glass pieces with copper solder solder as you would normally there are lots of things that can go wrong with scoring your glass and most of these have to do with how you re standing how much pressure you re using and what sort of a cutter you re using make sure that you re standing for long scores this will give you better reach by utilizing your shoulder and upper body in the scoring motion for small scores make sure that you stay seated so you can concentrate on following the marker score line use the right glass cutter you do not want to use a five dollar cheap glass cutter as it doesn t cut clear thin glass very well and it certainly won t cut much harder art glass get one that it has a carbide head because the oil lubrication is very useful make sure that you apply even pressure throughout your scoring remember you should hear a zipping sound as you score also good to remember opalescent glass requires more pressure cathedral glass requires less pressure like scoring soldering your glass can yield some problems if you re not doing it correctly make sure that the heat is correct that the tip of the soldering iron is the right size for the project and that the flux you re using is good for higher temperatures using the wrong kind of flux can lead to charring called black tip syndrome when this happens it means that the tip of the soldering iron turns black and re tinning becomes impossible use the right size soldering iron tip make sure that you know what the width of the glass you re working with is and have the tip and the copper spaced accordingly 
query	214	charge a car battery car batteries stay charged by harnessing the extra power of the car s engine and most can go for at least five years without needing to be replaced or recharged 1 but even the best car batteries will run out of power eventually or lose their charge prematurely when you leave your lights on too long it can be a serious inconvenience to find yourself with a dead battery but recharging one can require very little in terms of tools or mechanical experience preparing to charge the battery using a speed or trickle charger jump starting your battery troubleshooting battery issues put on the appropriate safety gear determine what kind of battery you have get a car battery charger disconnect and remove the battery from your vehicle if necessary clean the battery terminals place the charger on a stable surface connect the charger to the battery set the charger check the battery park a functioning car so that it faces the car you re jumping use jumper cables to connect the two batteries start the functioning car disconnect the cables and allow the vehicle to run have the battery checked by an auto parts store test the alternator listen for clicking take note if the vehicle stalls safety is paramount any time you are working on your vehicle start by putting on protective eye glasses to protect you from any falling material under the hood of the car sparks or battery fluid in the event the battery becomes compromised you may also want to wear gloves make sure the area you are working in is well ventilated and lit sufficiently to allow you to see where you are going and what you are working on gloves are not necessary but may protect your hands from small pinches and cuts while working on your vehicle make sure there are no children in the area while you work on the battery of a vehicle as sparks could fly if positive and negative cables come into contact with one another in order to properly charge your battery you must first identify the type of battery you have you can usually find this written somewhere on the battery but you may need to check the manufacturer s website if the label is too worn to read or missing you should also find out the voltage of the battery by looking on the battery s label or by checking in your vehicle owner s manual types of batteries include wet cell batteries may be serviceable which means there are things you can do to help improve the charge and the life of your battery vrla batteries valve regulated lead acid battery are completely sealed and require no maintenance these batteries come as gel cell or absorbed glass mat batteries and are less common in cars unless purchased as an after market modification pick a charger that is appropriate for your battery and purposes most chargers will work for all types of batteries except gel cell batteries there are fast chargers that can charge your battery quickly or even provide you with a jump start as well as trickle chargers that provide a slow but longer lasting charge many newer chargers come with a microprocessor to monitor how much the battery has charged these digital chargers will then stop the process automatically when the battery is fully charged older simpler chargers must be stopped manually to prevent dangerous overcharging and should not be left alone for extended periods of time while connected read the charger s instruction manual to make sure you are using your particular unit correctly even new digital chargers should be monitored closely while charging to ensure it functions properly and stops before over charging the battery it s important to disconnect the battery before conducting any repairs or maintenance on your vehicle most of the time you will be able to charge the battery without taking it out of the car but if reaching the battery or fitting the charging cables in the engine bay or trunk where the battery is located proves difficult remove the battery from the car completely while you charge it if you are unsure where your battery is located check the owner s manual for your vehicle some vehicles have the battery in the trunk while most have it under the hood disconnect the negative terminal first then the positive when removing a battery any dirt or grime on the battery terminals can prevent the charging cables from establishing a strong connection to the battery so it s important to clean the terminals thoroughly use baking soda and a wet cloth or a sandpaper pad to wipe away any grime or rust make sure the terminals are bare metal before moving on to the next step in order to ensure a strong charge sometimes you may find the battery has a solid charge but dirty terminals were preventing the electricity from flowing do not touch the terminals with your bare skin especially if there is any white powder on them this powder is usually dried sulfuric acid and it can burn your skin if you come in contact with it never place the battery charger directly onto the battery as it may connect the negative and positive terminals causing damage to the battery and charger and possibly even starting a fire instead place the charger on a stable surface as far from the battery as the cables will allow before plugging the charger into the wall ensure the area is well ventilated by opening your garage door or windows if you are indoors ensure the surface you place the charger on is sturdy and stationary to prevent it from falling or disconnecting from the battery use the full length of the cables to separate the battery from the charger as much as you can attach the black cable from the charger with the negative sign on it to the negative terminal on the battery marked with the same symbol then attach the red cable with the positive sign to the positive terminal on the battery with the corresponding symbol make sure to check the connections before plugging in or turning on the charger as mixing the positive and negative terminals could result in damage to the battery or even a fire some cars may label the positive terminal with the letters pos instead of a positive symbol and neg instead of a negative one ensure the cables are firmly attached to allow electricity to flow from the charger to the battery digital chargers may indicate the existing voltage in the battery and allow you to set the final voltage level while older models may simply allow for on and off settings speed chargers will also allow you to choose the speed in which you want to charge the battery often depicted by a picture of a turtle for slow charges and a rabbit for fast ones a fast charge is good for a car battery that recently died as a result of leaving your lights on or something to that effect while a battery that has been dead for some time may require the slower charging method before the battery is usable again if you can set the voltage the charger will stop on set it to the specified voltage on the battery or that you found in the vehicle s owner s manual never set the charger to fast charge if you will be leaving the vehicle unattended you may want to leave the battery slow charging overnight to fully charge it if it has been dead for some time after allowing the battery to charge check it to make sure it works some digital chargers will provide you with a readout that will tell you if the battery is properly holding the charge or if the battery will need to be replaced this is often indicated by a percentage like 100 as in the battery is 100 charged you may also want to use a voltmeter to measure the voltage of the battery once disconnected from the charger by touching the positive and negative cables from the voltmeter to their respective terminals on the battery if the battery is still in the car the easiest way to check it might be to simply hook it up again and attempt to start the car if the voltmeter reads the number of volts that are appropriate for the battery the charger indicates it s good or the vehicle starts the battery is sufficiently charged if the voltmeter or charger indicate that the battery is bad or the vehicle won t start there may be other issues to resolve or the battery may need to be replaced jump starting a vehicle involves using the electrical system of another running vehicle to charge the battery in yours sufficiently to allow it to start and charge itself before parking the functioning car make sure you locate the battery in both vehicles as some vehicle s batteries can be found in the trunk once you have located the batteries in both vehicles pull the running vehicle up to yours close enough so allow your jumper cables to connect both batteries if the battery is in the trunk of one of the vehicles back it up to the other so the cables can reach set the parking brake on both vehicles to ensure they don t move during the charging process remember that once you connect the jumper cables to a battery touching the positive and negative ends of the other side of the cables will produce sparks that may be dangerous with both cars shut off connect the jumper cable to the positive terminal of the dead battery and then to the positive of the good battery be sure not to allow the negative cables to dangle into the engine bay where they may touch metal that could serve as a ground to complete the circuit next connect the negative cable to the negative terminal of the dead battery followed by the negative cable on the appropriate terminal of the good one you may need to clean the terminals on both batteries to ensure a strong connection be sure you connect the positive ends to the positive terminals and the negative cables to the negative terminals mixing these up could result in damage or a fire with the cables securely connected start the functioning vehicle so its electrical system can begin charging the dead battery do not take the functioning vehicle out of park or neutral during the charging process allow the vehicle to run for a few minutes before attempting to start the other vehicle after a minute or two attempt to start the dead car if the battery only died recently it should start right up if it doesn t start after a minute or two allow it to charge for a bit longer if the battery has been dead for some time it may take longer to charge it enough to start once the vehicle starts you can disconnect the jumper cables from each vehicle allow the vehicle that had a dead battery to continue to run for a bit you may have charged the battery enough to start the vehicle but if you turn it off right away there may not be sufficient electricity to start it again by letting it run you give the vehicle s alternator an opportunity to charge the battery the rest of the way if the vehicle dies once again after it is disconnected from the other car check to make sure the battery is securely connected if the vehicle runs well take it out for a short drive to thoroughly charge the battery before turning it off again if you have charged the battery using a charger or another vehicle but your vehicle still won t start remove the battery if you haven t already and take it to a local auto parts store there they can charge the battery and check to see if it works fine can be serviced or needs to be replaced if your vehicle s battery is a vrla battery or a no maintenance wet cell battery you will have to replace it if it doesn t hold a charge if the battery is bad you will need to purchase a replacement for it if the battery is fully charged and working well but your car won t start check the battery cables to ensure they aren t broken and connect firmly to the battery a faulty alternator can prevent your vehicle from sufficiently charging the battery enough to start the car again and can even fail to produce enough electricity to keep the vehicle running you can check to see if you have an issue with the alternator by starting the vehicle then disconnecting the positive terminal of the battery a properly functioning alternator will produce enough electricity to keep the vehicle running without the battery but if the vehicle shuts off the alternator likely needs to be replaced you can sometimes tell if there is an issue with your alternator by looking at your interior lights if the lights get brighter as you press on the gas pedal then dim again when you remove your foot the alternator may be bad if you remove the alternator from your vehicle many auto parts stores can test it to ensure it s the problem before ordering a replacement if the car won t start but produces audible clicking when you try there likely isn t enough electricity in the battery to start the vehicle this may be because it failed to charge properly when you were charging it or it may be a result of the battery simply being too worn out to hold a charge try jump starting the car again or remove the battery and have it tested make sure you have a good connection to the battery when charging it otherwise the battery will not be able to start the car the clicking indicates that there is some electricity in the battery but not enough to start the engine if the vehicle starts after you charge the battery but stalls soon after it starts to run it may be because of the alternator if it will start up again or it continues to crank but fails to start running however the issue is not electrical you may have an issue with fuel or air delivery your vehicle needs air fuel and electricity to run properly you will likely need to take the car to a mechanic to identify the issue if this occurs

query	217	make a paracord lanyard if you re getting crafty with paracord making a lanyard can be a fun project that can also prove to come in handy in potentially dangerous situations to make your very own paracord lanyard all you need are a few supplies and some patience setting up the paracord braiding the paracord gather your materials mark the center of your paracord tie a lanyard knot make a simple overhand knot connect the paracord to the carabiner cobra stitch the paracord king cobra stitch the paracord cut and melt the loose ends to make a paracord lanyard you will need at least 6 13 feet of paracord 550 a metal carabiner clip snap hook or metal key ring a ruler or tape measure a twist tie or something to easily mark a the center of the cord scissors and a lighter the proportions of the paracord can differ depending on how long you want your lanyard to be for about every foot of paracord length used you will get about an inch of your braiding knots if you want to make a lanyard using just cobra stitching you may only need about 6 8 feet of paracord however if you want to make a king cobra stitched lanyard you may need about 13 feet for example 8 feet of paracord will yield about 8 inches of braiding knots for your lanyard fold your long 6 13 foot paracord in half at the top of the fold mark the center by tying a twist tie or rubber band around the paracord you can really use whatever kind of marker you want just make sure that it can stay put as you make your knot and then easily be removed if you are tying this knot for the first time it may be beneficial to use a sheet of paper to visualize how the cords intertwine to tie the know poke two holes vertically on top of each other about 4 inches apart through the middle of the paper feed the loose ends of the paracord through the holes in the paper and have the looped end of the cord on the left side of the paper while the loose ends through the paper go off to the right pull the cords all the way through the paper so there is no visible loop hanging on the left side but rather the loop is flush against the paper you will need about a two inch loop by the time you re finished with the knot so having the cords pulled flush against the paper can help you achieve this lay the paper flat on a table take the paracord passing through the bottom hole of the paper and make a loop near the paper hole then take the paracord passing through the top hole and place it underneath the bottom paracord s loop have the cord sit through the middle of the loop for example the top cord should look like a center pupil running through an eyeball the loop also place the upper cord underneath the bottom loop s tail cord feed the tag end of the top paracord down through the right side of the eyeball underneath the pupil and up through the left side of the eyeball gently pull both tails of the cords to tighten the knot just a little bit you should have a very elaborate and mirrored knot pattern take the tag end of the paracord coming from the bottom of the knot bring it around to trace the right of the knot past the top hole where the other cord is coming from and underneath all of the upper cords to come up through the eyeball center the same technique will be used for the other tag end of the paracord bring the upper paracord tail around to trace the left of the knot past the bottom hole where the other cord is coming from underneath all the lower cords to come up through the eyeball center of the knot tear off the piece of paper and hold onto the looped cord that was on the other side of the paper gradually pull and tug on both tag ends of the paracords while holding onto the looped cord make sure the looped side of the lanyard knot has about a two inch loop the center of the paracord marked should be in the middle of that two inch loop if the lanyard knot seems too complicated and intricate you can make a simple overhand knot from the looped portion of the paracord pinch down the paracord about 2 inches from the top of the loop twist the loop over the tag ends to make another larger hoop and pull the center of the looped paracord through the middle of the larger hoop feed the two loose ends of the paracord through the loop of the carabiner clip snap hook hole or metal key ring pull the ends through the loop until the lanyard knot is about 5 inches away from the base of the clip if the snap hook hole is pretty wide you can loop the ends of the cord around one more time to take up more of the wide space the two end sides of the paracord are the two cords you will be knotting to create the cobra stitch you will be knotting onto the two center cords running 5 inches down from the base of the carabiner take the left hand paracord and fold it to the right over and across the two center cords then take the right hand paracord and pass it on top of the tail end of the left side paracord under the two center cords and up through the loop created by the left hand paracord then pull the loose ends tight to make the next knot follow the same instructions except reversed to the other side take the right hand paracord and fold it to the left across the two center cords then take the left hand paracord and pass it on top of the tail end of the right side paracord under the two center cords and up through the loop created by the right hand paracord then pull the loose ends tight as you continue to knot you are going to alternate which side of the paracord gets crossed over the two center cords to make the first loop for example for the first knot you made the loop starting with the left hand paracord for the next knot start the loop with the right hand paracord for the knot after that start the loop with the left hand paracord and so on and so forth keep cobra stitching over the two center cords until you get 11 knot bumps on each side of the lanyard if this lanyard is satisfactory to you you can cut off the excess pieces and melt the loose ends to the rest of the paracord however if you want to use up the rest of your paracord you can do a king cobra stitch a king cobra stitch uses the same technique as a cobra stitch it is just done on top of an existing cobra stitch and makes the lanyard a bit thicker continue cobra stitching the paracords back toward the carabiner end using the same alternating sides stitching technique you used earlier begin by making the first loop with the paracord that has just gone under a loop you can tell which paracord this is by looking at the sides and seeing which paracord is coming out underneath a bump loop on the lanyard while making the king cobra stitches you may need to use your fingers to push the knots up toward the top to make them even however the king cobra stitch sides will naturally end up matching up with the spaces in between the original cobra stitches when you are finished king cobra stitching all the way back down to the end of the carabiner cut off the loose ends of paracord leave about inch space on the snipped ends melt each snipped end with a lighter using the lower darker part of the flame to melt the paracord rather than burn it after about 5 10 seconds of melting the paracord end push the paracord against rest of the lanyard with the metal part of your lighter this will help cool the melted paracord and connect the melted end to the rest of the lanyard do this same melting procedure for the other snipped end of the paracord when both loose ends of the paracord are melted and secure you are ready to use your paracord lanyard 
query	218	repair an electric water heater ran out of hot water you can easily repair and replace if necessary the controls and heating elements of most common residential 120 208 and 240 volt electric water heaters with traditional line voltage controls not the microprocessor types that are starting to appear in stores further it does not discuss gas or propane fuel types nor plumbing related issues this is a detailed comprehensive article with additional help on the discussion page repairing a heater replacing elements replacing controls check electrical panel to be sure that circuit breaker is in the on position not in tripped or off or fuses if used are installed securely and not blown shut off the power remove the upper and if provided lower access panel s clear away any insulation blocking access or view of the controls thermostat and high temperature switch and heating element look for obvious signs of damage locate the parts below high temperature limit switch has a reset button there will be 4 terminal screws wires connected to it test to ensure power is off measure voltage set the multimeter to ohms or resistance remove one wire from the heating element it does not matter which connect the black test lead to the jack marked common connect the red test lead to the jack marked ohms or resistance if there are multiple jacks from which to choose set the range if provided to r x 1 press the metal tips of the test probes together replace batteries if needed press the probe tips against the terminals of the heating element one probe to each screw be aware that a good heating element will read a very low value between 10 and 20 ohms depending on wattage of the element and possibly read as 0 ohms depending on your meter check for a grounded element hold the probes at the end of the test leads together press the red probe against either terminal screw of the heating element reconnect the wire that was removed from the heating element to perform the resistance check in the previous steps repeat the steps needed to gain access to the lower thermostat and heating element set the bottom thermostat to minimum set the top thermostat to maximum the steps below assume that there is warm water in the tank restore power to water heater remove red test lead from the ohms or resistance jack of the meter and insert into volt jack set the range of the meter to the lowest voltage value that is greater than 240 volts ac or vac check the top heating element s terminals for presence of line voltage by touching a probe tip to each terminal as done in the resistance test earlier if there is no power attempt to reset the high temperature switch after attempting reset check the heating element for power again if still no power present test the top left and right terminals of the high temp switch for line voltage with the probe tips if no power trouble is an open circuit once power is restored to top terminals of high temp switch test for line voltage at the top heating element if line voltage not found at the element and the top tank is cool replace top controls set top thermostat to minimum set lower thermostat to maximum check bottom heating element for presence of line voltage if no power present determine which wire is connects a heating element terminal screw to the bottom thermostat terminal screw if line voltage not found replace upper controls if line voltage found check for line voltage at heating element terminal screws by touching each probe to the terminal screws if line voltage not found and the tank is cool replace lower thermostat if line voltage is found wait for water to heat or perform the ohms or resistance checks on the elements once more with the power off return all thermostats to an equal value of your choosing but really should not be set higher than 140 degrees due to the risk of scalding replace insulation and access covers ensure power to water heater is off at the fuse circuit breaker or service switch the heating elements protrude into the tank and are immersed directly in the water of the tank to quickly drain and fill the water heater shut off the cold water supply to the heater close the tank s drain valve when the tank is empty or emptied to the point you desire disconnect wires from the terminals of the heating elements the heating elements are secured by one of several methods clean the tank surface around the opening for the element copy the nameplate data of the water heater to purchase correct replacement parts install the gasket on the element it is not necessary to wrap teflon tape or to apply pipe dope on threads of the new element s unless the new element specifies the use of it especially if the replacement element has a gasket secure the element into on the opening in the tank with the bolts through the flange or threads on the element make sure the nearest hot water faucet is still open and begin filling the water heater by opening the cold water supply valve shut off the hot water faucet check for evidence of water leaking from the new element s connect wires to heating element apply power to the water heater to prevent water hammer crack open the hot water faucets in the home to allow the pipes to slowly refill ensure power to water heater is off the tank does not need to be emptied to replace the controls identify wires and respective terminals controls are held in place and pressed against the tank by a spring steel clip copy the nameplate data of the water heater to obtain correct replacement parts clean the tank surface that the controls contact slip the controls under the steel fingers and make sure they are making good contact with the tank surface rewire the controls based on the labels applied on the old controls reset circuit breaker to on or replace any blown fuse s and wait 30 60 minutes for the water to warm if water has remained cool continue troubleshooting steps below most water heaters are supplied by voltages that can cause shock burns and even death should an energized conductor come in contact with the body shut off power in the electrical panel by removing fuses or by moving the handle of a switch or circuit breaker dedicated to the water heater to the off position completely remove and pocket the fuses or otherwise secure or lock the panel and place a note on the cover to alert everyone that work is being performed on the water heater circuit this will prevent the accidental energizing of the circuit while you are working on it the metal covers are usually held in place with screws remove the screws and save for reinstallation when done use a voltmeter or test light to check between wiring terminals and the grounded metal case of the tank to be sure that the power is off if power is still on do not proceed until you locate the fuse or circuit breaker supplying power lock off or secure the circuit breaker or remove fuses to prevent someone from turning the circuit on while you are working on the water heater once the thermal insulation has been removed plastic shock protectors are visible carefully fold any wires away from the protective cover lift the tab at the top away from the clip and remove to access terminals view with plastic shock protector removed water heaters can leak as a result of a failing tank but also due to poorly fitted or soldered cold water supply pipe hot water output pipe or a poor seal between tank opening and heating element if allowed to continue to leak it will cause internal damage to the controls should water enter them rust coats wires and controls both outside and insiderust is conductive even when on the wire insulation this can lead to potentially deadly shocks heating and melting insulation and even burns sooty black carbon deposits on surfaces indicate a short circuit chances are there is an exposed copper wire that may be difficult to see due to the carbon deposits that resulted from the short circuit wires may have been damaged and now suffer with a reduced circumference that is needed to safely carry the heating element electrical load this point of damage also becomes a source of heat it is very important to repair or replace all parts that have visible forms of water and short circuit damage this includes wires wire insulation jumpers and the controls themselves as mentioned above rust is a conductor and provides unintended and unexpected paths for electricity these unintended paths can be dangerous and make troubleshooting very difficult to perform here the yellow wire between the control and element appears to have shorted to the tank or other metal leaving a sooty black deposit on the wire and above notice the lower left terminal of the thermostat excessive heat has caused the plastic around the terminal to begin to melt usually the top two terminals have wires that go up to the field wiring compartment that bring the power to the rest of the water heater s controls and heating elements the upper controls consist of the high temperature limit switch and upper thermostat the lower controls refers to the lower thermostat there is no high temperature limit switch for the lower section of most electric water heaters three of the four terminals are numbered and visible in the picture 1 3 4 the 2 terminal is not identified as it is connected directly to the thermostat below via factory installed jumper thermostat has a graduated adjustable dial the dial may indicate letters a b c etc warm hot and hotter or as in the case of the one pictured the actual temperature in degrees the thermostat is located just below the high temp limit switch heating element has two terminals with a wire connected to each one of these wires is usually connected to the thermostat associated it in these photos the thermostat is directly above it it is usually located below the controls and supports the controls with a clip of some type in this photo it has two terminals and a gray metal clip attached to support the controls above set the meter for ac volts and insert the black probe into the black or common jack and the red probe into the red or volts jack set the ac voltage range to the highest available touch the probes to the top terminals of the high temperature limit switch as shown in the image to the right if desired the range may be lowered to any desired provided the range is greater than the voltage displayed at the highest range if unable to prove power off double check circuit panel do not proceed unless power is proved off otherwise damage to meter is likely and shock or burns is possible in the steps that follow in the provided picture the meter indicates 0 078 volts present this is less than 1 10 of a volt and is considered off observe the meter indication if an analog type the needle or pointer will be resting at over the higher resistance values left most position this is an open circuit indication if digital meter is used it may display ol or 1 1 without trailing or leading zeros this ol or 1 indication represents a value greater than the meter is capable of displaying similar to the way a calculator does for overload or infinity infinity in high resistance range is also called an open circuit or open loop ol take note of this open circuit indication for this meter when in a voltage or current range is selected and the meter displays ol or 1 the measurement should be taken again after adjusting the range upward if you are unsure what your meter should read in an ol situation just leave the terminals unconnected to anything and not touching each other and switch the meter on it should then indicate the resistance of the air between the terminals which should be infinity in normal conditions nan if the meter being used does not provide for range selection it is likely an autoranging type this simply means that the meter will automatically adjust the range up or down as needed without any intervention by the user this feature is far more common on digital meters than analog types most analog meters that do not provide manual range selection likely support only a single range these meters are much more accurate indicating low values such as 0 through 500k or 1m ohms than higher values such as those above 1m but will work well for this procedure pay close attention to the display of an auto ranging digital meter when reading there is a huge difference between 20 20k and 20m ohms a k indicates thousands and an m indicates millions the examples above would correctly be read as 20 ohms 20 000 ohms 20k ohms or 20 kilo ohms and 20 000 000 ohms 20 meg ohms or 20 million ohms each is 1000 times larger than the previous the analog meter pointer should move to lowest values of the resistance scale or fully to the right the digital meter should indicate 0 or a very low value approaching zero locate the zero adjust knob and turn so that the the meter indicates 0 or as close to 0 as possible most digital meters do not have this zero adjust feature once zeroed this needle position on the dial is the short circuit or zero ohms indication for this range of this meter the meter must be zeroed if the resistance range is changed measured resistance values will be inaccurate if unable to properly zero the meter in the example picture the meter indicates 0 2 ohms resistance or zero the meter can not display a value lower than this value since there is no zero adjust feature it is considered 0 if unable to obtain a zero ohm indication on an analog meter this may mean the batteries are weak and should be replaced retry the zeroing step above again with fresh batteries digital meters often graphically display the battery s level of discharge or simply an indication to replace the battery check the meter manual for help determining the battery charge state read the meter display look for a range multiplier a k or m in the display to be sure the value displayed is really ohms not kilo ohms k or meg ohms m in the provided picture the meter indicates 12 5 ohms resistance and since is within acceptable limits of the calculated 12 2 ohms value it is considered good to determine the resistance value for a good element use this online calculator provide the voltage likely 240 and wattage likely in the range of 1000 to 5000 ratings from the nameplate and click on the calculate button the picture displays the nameplate information of the water heater two different wattage ratings are provided 4500 4500 and 3500 3500 the 4500 4500 rating is the wattage rating for the upper and and lower element respectively when connected to a 240 volt supply alternatively the 3500 3500 rating is the wattage of the upper and lower element respectively when connected to a 208 volt supply most residential applications are 240 volts but 208 volt and 120 volt types are also found prepare the meter by setting the meter to highest resistance scale the analog meter pointer should move fully to the lowest values of the resistance scale to the right the digital meter should indicate a low value very close to zero locate the zero adjust knob and turn so that the the meter indicates 0 or as close to 0 as possible the digital meter may not have this zero adjust feature note that this position is the short circuit or zero ohms indication for this particular resistance range of this meter always zero the meter when changing resistance ranges press the black probe firmly against the metal tank or the heating element mounting nuts or screws not the other terminal screw scrape the metal to ensure a good contact the meter should display the infinity indication as described above in the meter setup if the meter displays a value other than a very high value millions of ohms preferably infinity the element should be replaced described later lower access panels removed exposing the plastic shock protector remove protector as done for upper access point above to expose the terminals notice that there is no reset button high limit on the like the top if the tank is cold or very hot it may be difficult to get the expected changes when dialing in different temperatures on the thermostat the rest of the steps have power on for continued testing use extreme caution as the risk of shock injury is greatly increased if not fully paying attention ensure all wires are reconnected to respective terminals and there are no accidental conductors anywhere that could cause a shock or short circuit as mentioned earlier common voltages for residential and mobile home rv type water heaters are 120 208 240 with the most common being the 240 volt variety when steps below discuss measuring line voltage substitute the voltage for your particular water heater instead line voltage is likely 120 208 or 240 in the u s the line voltage in the system under test is 208 volts since 203 is within a few percent of 208 this example indicates full power available to the element and if it passed the resistance or ohms test above is heating the water in the tank it is a button either red or black located directly above the thermostat it most likely has reset printed on it with a screwdriver or pencil gently but firmly press in if it is tripped a mechanical click should be felt or heard a tripped high temp switch is indicative of a thermostat that will not open more on this later check the heater s field wiring compartment usually located on the top of the heater along the length of the cable that feeds the heater and lastly inside the electrical panel remember unless power is shut off at panel this circuit is live at some point between the fuse or circuit breaker and the water heater tighten any and all wirenuts and connections in the wiring compartment and inside any junction boxes between here and all the way back to the terminals of the circuit breaker or fuses in the electrical panel replace open fuses or reset any tripped circuit breaker if off check for power at fuse or circuit breaker a circuit breaker that immediately trips after resetting indicates a short circuit or less likely defective circuit breaker read the rest of this step slowly and carefully and repeatedly if needed until it makes sense as it is the why and how the thermostats work together the key is to understand how the two thermostats interact and function differently the top thermostat has 2 positions it can switch voltage to one position or the other position 1 to the top element or position 2 to the lower thermostat the lower thermostat also has 2 positions but it is on and off not one or the other like the top thermostat position 1 to the lower element or position 2 prevent voltage from reaching the lower element or anywhere else for that matter in order for the top element to have voltage and heat the water the temperature of the water in the top of the tank must be lower than the temperature setting of the top thermostat once the water in the top part of the tank has reached the temperature value determined by the top thermostat setting the top thermostat is considered satisfied switches power from the top element to the lower thermostat if the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is higher than the lower thermostat s setting the lower thermostat remains off and voltage is prevented from reaching the lower heating element if however the temperature of the water in the bottom part of the tank is lower than the setting of the lower thermostat the lower thermostat switches on and sends voltage to the lower heating element a thermostat that has switched power to a heating element or cooling compressor is said to be calling and heats the water the voltage will remain on the lower element until either a the bottom thermostat is satisfied or b the top thermostat detects that the temperature of the water in the top of the tank has fallen below the temperature setting of the top thermostat when this occurs the top thermostat switches the power from the lower thermostat back to the top heating element this operation continues until the water in both halves of the tank is equal to the settings of their respective thermostats setting the top thermostat higher will not cause the top element to turn on if the water temperature in the top of the tank is already higher than the highest setting of the thermostat if this conditions exists no click will be detected when turning the temperature setting up and down it will be necessary to lower the temperature of the water in the tank the easiest and quickest way to do this is to allow hot water out of the tank by simply opening a hot water faucet cold water will enter the bottom of the tank and mix with the existing hot water in the tank lowering the overall temperature these will be the common screw terminals the other screw on the thermostat and heating element will be the power screw terminals touch red probe to the power screw terminal of heating element and black probe to the power screw terminal of thermostat expect line voltage if line voltage is present on a heating element it must heat the water unless the element has failed while water boils at 212 degrees a water temperature of only 150 degrees takes just two seconds to cause a burn when the water is 120 degrees just 30 degrees cooler it takes 10 minutes the skin of children and infants is more sensitive than that of an adult and will burn more easily because of this selecting a temperature closer to 120 degrees may be a better choice lower temperature settings translate to reduced energy costs too for this reason the water level in the tank must be lowered to a point below the level of the element to be removed otherwise water will leak out as the element is removed if removing the lower element or unsure how much to drain emptying the tank s entire contents will prevent unexpected spilling of water open the nearest hot water faucet to relieve vacuum pressure and allow air into the tank as it drains connect a garden hose to the drain valve at bottom of the tank and extend the hose to a floor drain or some other point that is lower than the drain valve as the tank will only drain down to the highest point of the hose open drain valve at the bottom of the water heater and drain the tank the first method is by bolts that are installed through holes in a flange around the element simply use a socket and ratchet or other suitable wrench to remove the 4 bolts and remove the element the second method is by a threaded portion of the element body that is found under a hex shaped flange of the element usually a 1 1 2 socket will fit perfectly if a socket of that size is not available use of a water heater element wrench channel lock style pliers or adjustable wrench will get the job done quickly twist the element counter clockwise until it is loosened enough to spin out completely by hand it is important that all gasket material filings rust etc be completely removed to reveal as smooth a surface as possible a wire brush and or sandpaper rubbed over the opening should make easy work of the job it would be best to bring along the old element for comparison to the new element both the upper and lower elements are the same make sure the element is snugged tightly against the tank opening otherwise water will leak out when the tank is filled and under pressure it will be best to tighten these bolts the way lug nuts on a tire are tightened one nut then the opposite nut repeat as needed do not over tighten at first only air will be heard escaping out of the hot water faucet as the tank continues to fill the hot water faucet will sputter air and be followed by dirty water continue fill the tank until the discharge water from the hot water faucet runs clear and without sputtering steady stream of water tighten as needed to stop the leak and wipe dry repeat as necessary any leak that can not be stopped will require disassembling and cleaning the tank opening and element to ensure a 100 seal when reinstalled the heating elements must be completely submerged in water before applying power failure to completely fill the tank prior applying power will result in instant heating element burnout and will require replacement again start with the lowest level faucets and work up to the highest level faucets optionally remove shower head s and aerators from sink faucets and spray heads to prevent sediment from clogging them label the terminals and the wires by either 1 writing numbers on masking tape and apply to the wires and terminals or 2 apply color coded tape to wires and terminals or 3 other identifying means before disconnecting no screws are used to remove the controls after removing wires lift the steel retaining fingers on both sides of the control away from the tank slightly and slip the controls out excessive force on the fingers may damage them and prevent the controls from seating properly a poorly seated control prevents it from properly detecting tank temperature as it relies on firm physical contact with the tank for heat transfer removing the controls from a hot tank and retesting will insure tank temperatures were not causing a normal cutout it may help to bring along the old controls for comparison to the new controls remove any rust debris and dirt

chard add 1 tbsp season with salt and pepper to taste to choose your swiss chard you should look for leaves that are bright and bushy not browned wilted or damaged the stems of swiss chard are delicate so you should look for stems that are firm and unbruised though there are a variety of swiss chard forms any type of shard should look healthy full buoyant and not wilted or droopy there are several varieties of swiss chard their ribs which are the parts of the stems that extend up into the leaves can be red white or yellow the varieties have different tastes so experiment to find which kind you prefer swiss chard with red ribs is often a little sweeter with less bitter undertone than swiss chard with white ribs all the varieties of chard can be prepared the same way but they can have a different flavor the ribs of different varieties of swiss chard are different widths some people prefer the ribs of the swiss chard and some like the leaves best if you prefer the ribs choose swiss chard with wide ribs if you like the leaves best choose swiss chard with thinner ribs before you cook the chard you ll need to wash it the first thing you should do is wash it well by rinsing it in a sink full of cold water you can even drain the water and repeat unless the chard is free of dirt if you got the chard at a farmers market it will be extra fresh and more likely to have dirt on it so wash thoroughly don t wash the chard until right before you re going to cook it or it will wilt small leaves of swiss chard can be left whole or added to salad and larger leaves with thin ribs can also be left whole for cooking but if you re cooking swiss chard with thick ribs then you should separate the ribs from the leaves by tearing the leaves away from the ribs because the ribs will need to cook for a few more minutes since they are tougher than the leaves add thick ribs to the steamer a few minutes before the green parts of the leaves the leaves will cook in 1 to 2 minutes swiss chard is done when it is wilted and tender steam swiss chard with thin ribs whole in the microwave with the water that remains on its leaves after washing this should take 1 to 2 minutes microwaves vary in intensity so be sure to check your swiss chard frequently until you have determined how long it takes to cook in your microwave if you overcook it it will be soggy so start checking its appearance after one minute place it in enough water to cover it fully add thick stems to the water 1 or 2 minutes before the green parts of the leaves then cook 1 to 2 minutes more place 2 3 tablespoons of olive oil or butter in a pan and wait for it to heat up then add the swiss chard stems and cook them for 2 3 minutes before you add the chard leaves you can even chop the stems into 4 inch parts to manage them more easily continue cooking the chard for up to five minutes until it s tender you can freeze swiss chard and store it for up to a year wash your swiss chard and then blanch it in boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes cool swiss chard in an ice bath drain the swiss chard and pack it into zippered freezer bags with no headspace put it in the freezer tear the leaves away from the stems and center ribs chop them coarsely and place them in a bowl cut them into 2 3 inch 5 7 6 cm pieces butter and 2 tbsp olive oil in a large skillet melt them over medium high heat and wait for the butter to melt completely minced garlic and 1 2 diced small red onion cook them together for at least 20 seconds until the mixture is fragrant simmer the stems for 5 minutes or until they begin to soften cook the chard until the leaves are wilted at least another 3 minutes turn off the heat and place the chard into a bowl fresh lemon juice and 2 tbsp grated parmesan cheese mix the chard until you ve distributed the lemon juice and parmesan cheese season to taste with salt place the chard on a serving dish and enjoy it as a side dish cut the portobello mushrooms from one 8 oz package into pieces that are 1 2 to 2 inches 1 2 to 5 cm long you don t have to chop it into perfectly sized pieces just cut it enough so the chard can fit into the pan with leaves that are no more than 5 inches 12 cm long olive oil in a large pot over medium high heat crushed red pepper and 1 clove crushed garlic into the oil stir the mushrooms until they have softened and have begun to release their liquid this should take 3 5 minutes cook for 5 more minutes until the leek has softened cover the mixture and simmer it until the chard leaves wilted this should take about 10 minutes keep cooking the chard until it s tender and most of the liquid has evaporated make sure not to burn the chard if the liquid has evaporated too early this should take about five minutes let the chard stand until the cheese is melted serve the chard and portobellos as a side dish or even as a main course you can top some quinoa or whole wheat pasta with the chard for a delicious meal you won t need them for this recipe

little color creating a colorful smoky eye is just as simple as creating a neutral one you just have to choose a bold fun color to substitute for the black you can create a traditional smoky eye with your colorful shades or go for a striking halo smoky eye where dark colors sandwich a light shade on the center of your lid if you re ready to try a bolder eye look a colorful smoky eye may be for you choosing a color for your smoky eye applying a traditional colorful smoky eye creating a colorful halo smoky eye use warm orange shades for blue eyes select red and pink shades for green and hazel eyes grab blue or green shades for brown eyes opt for purple shades no matter what your eye color apply an eyeshadow primer or base smudge dark eyeliner along your upper and lower lash lines sweep a neutral shadow through the crease press a mid tone colorful shadow onto the lid deepen the outer corner of the eye with a dark colorful shadow highlight your brow bone and inner corner coat your lashes with mascara smooth on an eyeshadow primer blend a neutral transition shadow through the crease apply a mid tone colorful shadow to the inner and outer corners darken the inner and outer corners with black shadow press a light colored shadow to the center of the lid repeat the steps on your bottom lashline highlight the inner corner smudge dark liner along your upper lash line add several coats of mascara to your lashes when it comes to choosing colored shadows for a smoky look on blue eyes warm orange shades are usually the most flattering option orange is opposite blue on the color wheel so orange toned shadows create a bold contrast with blue eyes that really make them pop some orange tones to consider include burnt orange copper coral amber rust pumpkin and tangerine for green and hazel eyes you ll get the most flattering colorful smoky eye if you use cranberry and pink shadows red is opposite green on the color wheel so it creates the most striking contrast for eyes that are green or have green flecks some red and pink tones to consider include cranberry maroon wine brick dusty rose mauve and magenta brown eyes typically feature orange and red undertones so blue and green shades typically offer the best smoky eye look that s because orange is opposite blue and red is opposite green on the color wheel some blue tones to consider include cobalt navy teal violet and midnight blue some green tones to consider include olive forest green emerald and moss purple is the most universally flattering shade of eyeshadow so it typically works well for everyone it is especially beautiful with brown and green eyes but blue eyed people can wear it too some purple tones to consider include eggplant plum and royal purple an eyeshadow primer provides a base for your shadow to stick to so it lasts all day use a clean finger to spread the primer from your lash line to your brow if you don t have an eyeshadow primer you can substitute concealer smooth it over your eyelid just as you would with primer if you have dark skin or just want to make sure that your colorful smoky eye is as vibrant as possible it helps to use a white base as your primer blend a white cream eyeshadow over your eyelid so the colors that you place on top of it really pop to get the classic smoky look you need to li your upper and lower lash lines with a creamy eyeliner pencil after you ve applied the liner use a pencil brush or cotton swab to softly smudge it black liner is traditionally used for a smoky eye but you can also use a dark liner that coordinates with your shadows if you re doing a blue smoky eye you can substitute a navy eyeliner if you re doing a green smoky eye you can substitute a forest green eyeliner if you re doing a orange smoky eye you can substitute a bronze or warm brown eyeliner if you re doing a purple smoky eye you can substitute a plum eyeliner if you re doing a red or pink smoky eye you can substitute a reddish brown eyeliner like black a charcoal gray eyeliner can also work with any colorful smoky eye to help the colorful shadows you use in your smoky blend more easily you want to use a subtle transition color in the crease use a fluffy crease brush to softly blend a neutral eyeshadow that s two or three shades deeper than your skin tone through your crease the crease of your eye is the area above the lid where your eye naturally folds a brown or tan shade is usually the best option for a transition shade if you re worried about your smoky eye looking too stark you may want to use a transition shade with some warmth your bronzer can do double duty as your transition shade if that s the case after you ve added the transition shade to your crease use a flat eyeshadow brush to apply a mid tone shadow in your choice of color to your lid use a pressing motion to apply the shadow to avoid fallout and be sure to smooth the shadow over the eyeliner that you ve applied a mid tone shade basically means a shadow that falls between light and dark shades on the color spectrum you don t want to use the darkest colorful shade that you have on the lid but the shadow should be darker than your usual lid colors use a clean fluffy brush to blend the edge of your lid color into the transition shade for a seamless look to add depth to your smoky eye use a pencil brush to apply a dark colored eyeshadow that coordinates with your lid color to the outer corner of your eye make a sideways v shape so one line is angled down toward the lash line and one line is angled up toward the outside of the crease make sure to blend out the shadow that you add to the outer corner with a clean fluffy brush so there aren t any harsh lines when it comes to choosing a dark shade to use in the outer corner opt for the same color family as your lid shade for example if you ve used a emerald green on the lid you might use a forest green in the outer corner if you don t have a dark shadow that coordinates with the color that you ve chosen for your smoky eye you can substitute black to keep your smoky eye from looking too dark it s important to use a light shadow to highlight your brown bone and inner corner sweep a light shade such as ivory cream beige or tan beneath your brow with a small fluffy brush blending it into the transition use a small detail brush to dab a small amount of the same shadow to the inner corner around the tear duct you can use a matte or shimmery shadow to highlight your brow bone and inner corner however with a smoky eye it s especially flattering to use a shimmery shade for the inner corner because it will reflect the light so your eyes appear brighter with dark shadow on your eyes it s easy for your lashes to get lost finish off your look with one to three coats of your favorite mascara to help them stand out against the colorful smoky shadow to really open up your eyes with smoky shadow it s a good idea to use an eyelash curler to curl your lashes before you apply the mascara make sure to apply some mascara to your lower lashes too they ll have trouble standing out against the dark liner that you ve smudged there to keep your colorful smoky shadows in place all day you must start with an eyeshadow primer dab a small amount of primer onto each eyelid and blend it up through the crease it s a good idea to rub whatever primer is left on your finger along your lower lash line so the colors that you apply there will stay in place just as with a classic smoky eye you want to apply a transition shade to the crease to make it easier to blend the colors out however because you want all the attention on the colors on your lid choose a light neutral shadow that s only a shade or two darker than your skin tone sweep it through the crease with a fluffy crease brush make sure to blend the transition shade well after you apply it so it has a soft look with your transition shade in place use a small fluffy shadow brush to apply a mid tone shadow in the color family that you ve chosen to the inner third and the outer third of your lid blend the shadow slightly into the crease above the respective areas be sure to leave the center of your lid and crease free of eyeshadow with a small tapered blending brush apply a small amount of black shadow over the colored shadow in the inner and outer corners of your lid and crease you shouldn t cover the colorful shadow completely concentrate the black in outer edges of both areas you don t necessarily have to use black shadow for darkening up your eyes instead use a dark shadow from the same color family as the colored shadow you ve used for example if you ve used a royal blue in the inner and outer corners darken them up with a navy blue shadow after you ve darkened up the inner and outer corners use a flat shadow brush to apply light shade from your chosen color family to the center of the lid a shimmery or metallic shadow is the best option because it will stand out even more if you want to be sure that the lighter shadow really stands out you can dab a small amount of a white cream shadow over the center of your lid before applying the shadow use a small fluffy brush to blend the lines between the dark and light colors so the shadow looks soft and smoky with the shadow done on your lid apply shadow to your lower lashline in the same manner use a pencil brush to apply the mid tone shade to the inner and outer corners a darker shadow on just the outermost corners and the light shade in the middle you can repeat the same process on your waterline the bit of skin on your lower lid above your lashes by using a light pencil liner in the center and a dark pencil liner on the outer and inner corners however you can also use a dark liner across the entire waterline or skip liner there completely to ensure that your eyes look bright even with a dark color on your inner corners it s especially important to highlight that area use a small detail brush to trace the area around your tear duct with a light shimmery shadow depending on how light the shadow you used on the center of your lid is you may want to use it to highlight the inner corner otherwise use an ivory cream beige or pale gold shadow once your eyeshadow is finished use a dark eyeliner pencil to line your upper lashline smudge the liner with a pencil brush or cotton swab to keep the look smoky you can use a black liner or a dark liner that coordinates with the colorful eyeshadows that you ve used the liner is an optional step you can skip it completely if you prefer to finish off your look apply two to three coats of your favorite mascara to help your lashes stand out brush through your lashes with a lash comb to ensure that they are no clumps if you like you can also add some false lashes to really make your eyes look fluttery 
query	221	get an eyelash out of your eye getting a stray eyelash in your eye is an uncomfortable and sometimes painful experience loose eyelashes can fall into the eye as a result of wiping your eyes crying or from windy weather the eye is a sensitive part of the body and it s important to treat it gently in this case rinsing with liquid using a q tip or your fingers using your eyelids sleeping on it seeing an eye doctor flood the eye by splashing water into your eyes rinse the eye by lowering your open eyes into water pour a saline solution eye drops into the eye locate the problem lash use one finger to move the eyelash into the inner corner of your eye toward your nose remove with a q tip remove with your fingers grab the top eyelid s lashes with your thumb and pointer finger pull your eyelid out and down over your lower eyelashes release your eyelid and let it slide back go to sleep with the eyelash still in don t rub or touch your eyes during the night check your eye when you wake up call the doctor s office beforehand and explain what you need see an optometrist see an ophthalmologist this is the easiest and fastest method of removing an eyelash splashing your eyes with water can cause the eyelash to simply be rinsed out with the water mineral and bottled water is ideal as it s more sterile than tap water you can use tap water if you don t have mineral or bottled available cup your hands catch some water in them and splash into open eyes it is okay to blink when the water touches your eye repeat several times if necessary until the eyelash is gone this is another slightly gentler way to rinse out the eyelash using water use mineral or bottled water if you have it pour water into a large bowl slowly lower your face with open eyes into the water until the liquid touches your eyes if you feel the urge to blink when your eyes touch the water do so all that matters is that the liquid touches your eye the eyelash should then wash out into the bowl repeat several times if necessary until the eyelash is gone saline like mineral water is more sterile than tap water and safer for the eye take an eyedropper and fill it with saline solution while keeping your eyes open pour a few drops directly into the open eye hopefully the eyelash washes right out repeat if necessary many saline solutions come in small bottles with a squirt head if this is the case you don t have to use an eyedropper simply lift the bottle and pour a few drops into your eye blink and if necessary repeat several times until the eyelash is washed out for this method of removal you need to set the stage by locating the eyelash and washing your hands look in a mirror to see where in your eye the lash is located you should use your fingers or a q tip to remove only if the eyelash is on the white part and not the colored part of the eye the colored part is more sensitive and you may want to see an eye doctor instead if the eyelash is there wash your hands use soap and dry your hands completely washing your hands removes bacteria that you could otherwise get into your eye stand in front of a mirror as you do so and keep your eyes open so you can see what you re doing don t push it all the way to the corner just away from the center pupil of the eye make sure that the cotton of the q tip has not loosened as you don t want any particles coming off into your eye if try this more than once use a new q tip for hygiene each time you touch your eye moisten a q tip by immersing the tip in saline solution saline solution will not hurt the eye to get the q tip wet you can either unscrew the lid of a saline bottle solution and dip the q tip in or pour a little into a bowl and dip the q tip into that touch the q tip gently to the eyelash keep your eye open while doing so you may want to hold your eyelids open with the fingers of one hand while holding the q tip with the other remove the eyelash ideally the eyelash sticks to the q tip and is removed safely and easily simply pull the q tip directly backward taking the eyelash with it this method involves either swiping or pulling it out with your fingers make sure that your hands are clean and that you keep your eyes open swipe the eyelash with one finger you may want to hold the eyelids of the affected eye open with the fingers of your non dominant hand with one finger of the other hand gently swipe the eyelash in a light sliding motion try not to blink the eyelash should be dislodged from the eye by the motion of your finger pull the eyelash with two fingers if a simple swipe doesn t dislodge it try gently pinning it between two fingers your fingers should rest gently on your eye as you pin the eyelash between them do not use this method if you have very long fingernails as you may scratch your eye once you have the eyelash caught between two fingers pull it gently directly outward pinpoint the location of the eyelash before trying this method this works best if the eyelash is trapped in the top part of the eye pull the lid gently not strongly your upper and lower lashes should brush against each other try blinking once or twice with your lid closed it might help loosen the lash from the area it s stuck ideally the motion of your lid against the eyeball as it moves dislodges the eyelash it may stick to your lashes instead of the eye from which you can remove it easily or fall out of your eye as you open your lid the eyes naturally get rid of dirt and substances while you sleep the crust you often find on your eyes and eyelashes when waking up is a result of the eye s self cleaning process this could irritate your eye and even potentially scratch the cornea try to ignore any discomfort hopefully the eyelash has disappeared like magic as your eye naturally removed it if the eyelash hasn t disappeared it may have moved into a comfortable and more easily accessible area then you can remove it using other methods the doctor should take no more than five minutes to get the eyelash out specifying beforehand what you need increases your chances of seeing a doctor that day you can visit either an optometrist or an ophthalmologist optometrists primarily treat vision problems but are equipped to handle some eye diseases and concerns as well ophthalmologists are medical doctors who treat a wide range of eye problems the doctor will remove the eyelash quickly and safely ensuring the eye doesn t get infected

are better for your nails if you don t have a cuticle pusher a wooden popsicle stick can be substituted it s easier to push back cuticles when they re soft and wet rather than dry soak your fingers in warm water for a few minutes before using the cuticle pusher and preferable work on them days before so they are extra fine for your treatment this removes the remaining moisture and oils from your nails to get them ready for the acrylic this step is one of the most important for best adhesion if oil remains on your nails the acrylic won t stick use a cotton ball or preferably a lint free paper towel to carefully rub the surface of your nails with acetone nail primer with acid is made with an methacrylic acid which can burn be careful not to use too much or get it on your skin there are acid free primers if you are unsure of the acid ones find the right size tips for your nail if the tip doesn t fit your nail perfectly file it down to size a little too small can sometimes look better than a little too big place a dab of glue on the tip from side to side and apply it to your natural nail so that the bottom edge of the acrylic tip is centered halfway down the surface of your nail hold it

stray on the brush not drip off of the brush have paper towels handy in case you need to brush off extra moisture and to wipe the brush between strokes so the acrylic doesn t stick to the brush start at the smile line the bottom edge of the acrylic tip flatten the acrylic ball over the line and brush it down to the tip spread it quickly and smoothly so that the transition between your natural nail and the acrylic tip is smooth take a second ball of acrylic and place it near your cuticle but not too close with small circular movements try to get the acrylic closer to the cuticle without touching

brush and then wipe it off again less is more if you have too much acrylic on the nails you ll have to file for what feels like an eternity working with small beads is easier in the beginning if you apply the acrylic correctly there should be a gentle curve rather than a harsh line where the acrylic tip meets your natural nail you may need to use more than one ball of acrylic per nail to achieve this don t apply the acrylic to your cuticle it should start a few millimeters above your cuticle so that it adheres to your nail not your skin it should only take about ten minutes before the acrylic is completely set test it by tapping the surface of your nail with the handle of your acrylic brush if it makes a clicking sound it s ready for the next step now that the acrylic has set use a course nail file 180 grit for example to shape the tips and file them to the length you want use a buffer to buff the surface of the nails the 240 grit file takes away the scratches from the 180 grit file

query	223	read guitar tabs guitarists have their own special system of music notation called guitar tablature or guitar tabs for short using guitar tabs a guitarist can play a wide variety of music without ever having to learn how to read standard sheet music though guitar tabs aren t a perfect way of describing music they ve allowed newer generations of guitarists to quickly and easily share information about how to play songs across the globe via the internet every guitarist should have at least a basic understanding of how to read tablature it s the de facto shorthand for much of the guitar music you ll find written out online using tabs to fret notes and chords reading special symbols reading an example tab view tab notation as a representation of the guitar s strings use the numbers on the tab to fret spaces on the neck play vertically stacked numbers at the same time proceed from left to right look for lyrics or chord changes look for additional symbols in the tab learn the symbol for hammer ons learn the symbol for pull offs learn the symbol for string bends learn the symbols for slide techniques learn the symbols for tremolo bar techniques learn the symbol for vibrato learn the symbols for muting techniques learn the symbol for tapping learn the symbols for harmonic techniques learn the symbol for trills learn the symbol for tremolo picking glance over the tab below start with the chord at the far left proceed to the next two chords play the individual notes at the right put it all together a tab is usually written using six horizontal lines each corresponding with a string on the guitar the bottom line represents the lowest thickest string while the top string represents the highest thinnest string for standard tunings this means that the lines will represent from the bottom up the low e a d g b and high e strings e thinnest string b g d a e thickest string unlike normal musical notation guitar tabs don t tell you which notes to play instead they tell you where to put your fingers numbers on the lines correspond to frets on the fretboard each number represents a specific fret on the line it s written on for instance a 1 on the bottom line means to fret the first fret of the lowest string and play that note if the number is greater than 0 1 2 3 4 etc then press your finger on that fret when you play with 1 being the fret closest to the stock and fret numbers increasing as you move towards the guitar s body if the number is 0 then pluck the open string without fretting any notes when reading tabs many times you ll come across numbers that are aligned vertically these are chords fret every note in the chord as written then play the notes all at the same time you ll get a fuller sound than you might see the chord name written as well see example 2 below tabs are read like sentences in a book read them from left to right across the page dropping down to the next line only when you ve reached the end of the previous play the notes and chords in sequence as you read them from left to right note that most but not all tabs don t display the rhythm with which you should play the notes in the tab they may break the tab into measures usually signified by vertical lines in the tab between measures but they won t tell you the rhythm of the notes within the measures in this case it s best to listen to the song while you read the tab to find the beat some advanced tabs do count out the beat for you this is usually done by including rhythmic markings along the top of the tab notation each marking is vertically aligned with a note or a rest to give a sense of how long the note or rest lasts typical rhythmic markings include w whole note h half note q quarter note e eighth note s sixteenth note sometimes markings are included to show that a note or rest lies on the and of a certain beat a dot after the rhythm marking means the corresponding note or rest is dotted for instance q dotted quarter note for rhythm basics see how to read music many songs have guitar parts made up solely or mostly of chords this is especially true for rhythm guitar parts in this case the tab may forgo typical tab notation in favor of a simplified list of chord changes these chords are almost always written in standard chord notation amin a minor e7 e dominant 7 etc simply play the chords in the order that they re listed if it s not noted otherwise try playing one chord per measure but if the changes don t sound right listen to the song for the strumming pattern sometimes these chord changes are printed above the lyrics of the song to give you a sense of when these chords are played as in this snippet from a tab for the beatles twist and shout a7 d g a well shake it up baby now shake it up baby as you can see in the example above many tabs aren t just collections of lines and notes tabs use a wide variety of special symbols to tell you how to play the notes in the tab most symbols refer to specific playing techniques to make a song sound as much like the recording as possible pay attention to these special markings in a tab an h inserted between two notes e g 7h9 means to perform a hammer on to hammer on play the first note normally then use a finger on your fretting hand to tap down on the second note without using your strumming hand to pluck the note sometimes is used instead e g 7 9 a p inserted between two notes e g 9p7 means to perform a pull off which is essentially the opposite of a hammer on pluck the first note while using another finger to fret the second note then quickly lift the finger fretting the first note the second note will sound as with hammer ons sometimes is used instead e g 9 7 in this case know to perform a pull off if the second note is lower and a hammer on if the second note is higher if a b is inserted between two fret numbers e g 7b9 fret the first note and bend it up until it sounds like the second sometimes the second number is in parentheses and occasionally the b is omitted altogether if there is an r it denotes what the note should be released to e g 7b9r7 perform a basic slide by striking a note moving your finger up or down a string without releasing it from the fretboard then striking another note an ascending slide is marked by a forward slash and a descending slide is marked by a backwards slash e g 7 9 7 a lowercase s usually means to perform a legato slide this is like a normal slide but you only strike the first note with your pick let your target note sound simply from the motion in your fret hand there is debate among guitarists over whether a light pick strike is appropriate for the target note the most important thing is to remember to leave no gap between notes shift slides are signified by an uppercase s in this case strike the target note without striking the initial note of the slide if your guitar has a tremolo bar also known as a whammy bar or vibrato bar follow these symbols to achieve some remarkably out there effects if you see a n where n some number perform a tremolo bar dip quickly hit and release the bar to dip the note s pitch the number between the slashes gives an indication of the pitch you should dip to dip the pitch by n semitones a semitone is the same as the pitch between two adjacent frets for instance 5 means to drop the pitch by 5 semitones which will be the same tone as 5 frets below the original note if you see a n where n some number fret note n then strike it and depress the tremolo bar deeply to dramatically drop the pitch if you see n raise the tremolo bar up after striking note n to raise the pitch on some guitars you can also put your bar in inverted position first so that hitting the bar raises the pitch rather than lowers it if you see n perform a tremolo bar inverted dip by first depressing the tremolo bar then raising it as above this also works in inverted position look for or v if you see these symbols perform vibrato on the preceding note strike the note then use your fretting hand to rapidly bend and unbend the string vibrating the pitch of the note several tab symbols indicate different methods for giving notes a muted sound if you see an x or a dot below the number mute the string lay your fretting hand finger s across the designated strings so that when you strike them they produce a dull clicking sound several x in a row on adjacent strings indicates a rake just mute more than one string at once if you see pm play using palm muting for standard right handed guitar playing gently lay the edge of your right palm across the strings near the guitar s bridge when you strike the notes with the same hand as is providing the mute you should hear the tone of the note but with a subdued dead quality move your hand slightly up the strings toward the neck to deaden the notes more tapping is usually represented by a t if you see a t in a string of notes e g 2h5t12p5p2 use one of the fingers on your picking hand usually your right hand to tap down hard on the indicated fret this is a useful technique for making very rapid fast changes in pitch guitar tabs differentiate between several different techniques for playing harmonics bell like tones created by special fretting techniques for natural harmonics the fret is surrounded by e g 7 if you see this lay a fretting finger across the metal line at the right of the fret not the middle of the fret then strike the string for a clear bell tone pinch harmonics are signified by surrounding the fret number in brackets e g to perform a pinch harmonic strike the note with your pick hand while your pick hand thumb is also touching the note use vibrato from your fret hand to add sustain to the tone pinch harmonics are difficult it requires lots of practice note these are best performed on an electric guitar with distortion using a bridge pickup tapped harmonics are signified by two notes the second enclosed in parentheses e g n n tapped harmonics are like natural harmonics but shifted around the neck fret the first note then use a finger on your pick hand to slap or strike the string at the second fret position when you see a tr written in or above the tab it s usually between or above two notes often it s accompanied by a string of tildes s this simply means to strike the first note then rapidly hammer on to the second note and pull off to the first note again and again tp means you should tremolo pick the note essentially pick the single note over and over as rapidly as you can sometimes a tp symbol is followed by a string of tildes or dashes to give you a sense of how long to tremolo pick notice that it shows several three note chords as well as some individual notes descending on the higher strings in the following steps we ll walk through this tab beat by beat e 3 0 b 3 0 g 7 7 7 2 0 d 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 a 2 5 5 5 7 7 7 e 0 5 5 5 in this case first you would play a power chord in e middle finger finger 2 on the second fret on the a string ring finger finger 3 on the second fret on the d string and no finger on the low e string strumming those first 3 strings e a d once play the chord highlighted with parentheses below e 3 0 b 3 0 g 777 2 0 d 2 777 777 a 2 555 777 e 0 555 the next chord you would play would be a power chord on the fifth fret of a three times so you would play with your index finger on the fifth fret of a your middle finger on the seventh fret of d and your ring finger on the seventh fret of g then simply shift this finger shape down one string so that your index finger is on the fifth fret of the e string with your other fingers on the seventh frets of the a and d strings play the chords in the sequence that they re highlighted with parentheses below e 3 0 b 3 0 g 7 77 2 0 d 2 7 77 777 a 2 5 55

characteristics change according to the amount of time the leaves are exposed to air the lightest is white tea often made from unopened plant buds green tea is produced from the green leaves while oolong and black teas are made from leaves that have been exposed to air while many studies focus on green tea you can gain benefits from any variety find a variety you enjoy drinking and keep in mind that there is a lot of flavor variation within each category green and white teas lightly processed tea leaves available in many varieties and flavors visit our guide for detailed info black tea these

other helpful substances herbal tea any brew made from a plant other than the traditional tea plant usually less effective but still a good option when replacing high calorie drinks while diet tea tastes similar to many black or herbal teas diet teas mayuse extra caution if the tea contains senna aloe agarwood rhubarb root buckthorn or castor oil contain a laxative element so you should drink these teas in moderation experts warn against drinking too many cups of diet tea because you could develop vomiting nausea persistent diarrhea abdominal cramps and even fainting and dehydration the concept of diet tea is sort of false advertising any unsweetened natural tea can promote weight loss certain teas may act as a laxative or fat blocker and that s why they re marketed as such however laxatives just clean out your colon you ve already consumed the calories you may lose a little bit of water weight initially but the second you drink something it ll come back one cup is enough seriously you ll regret drinking more there are so many types of teas on the market it s hard to know where to start a good place to start is by reading the ingredient list on the back label if it has added sugar or sweeteners put it back on the shelf this doesn t mean you have to avoid flavored green teas true some have added sugar but others don t and if you can stick to all natural ingredients all the better for you and your waistline one hurdle some people face is that brewing tea while not an incredibly arduous process may not be as easy as they d like it to be while you can brew a quick cup of tea in the microwave pour water into a ceramic cup and heat for two minutes until boiling then add your teabag you can make the process even easier purchase an electric teakettle electric teakettles are readily available at many bath and kitchen stores ranging in price and are extremely easy to use all you have to do is fill it with water and push a button or lever to bring it to a boil you can brew tea by the cup or add several tea bags to the entire pot once the water has boiled keep a thermos as well for the additional boiled water fill with water add the green tea and keep by the kettle or your desk for ease of pouring a tea when needed buy an iced tea maker during warmer months drinking hot tea may not sound like fun however you can still consume just as much tea by using an iced tea maker like the electric teakettle simply fill the machine with water add ice according to the manufacturer s directions and teabags turn it on and begin drinking fresh iced tea in a matter of minutes brew iced tea the night before for quick access during the day if you don t have a few minutes to brew your iced tea that day make it at night and keep a pitcher of tea in your refrigerator instead of bringing a few sodas to work consider filling a large thermos with iced tea and keep it on hand throughout the day in order to reap the benefits of tea you ll have to start drinking it every day do not add cream milk or sugar to your tea when trying to lose weight as often as possible and plain if it s not easy tasty and convenient you won t stick to it how can you enable yourself to drink it more having tea supplies is the easiest way to get started if you spend 8 hours a day at the office it s a good idea to stock up there too along with having your favorite mug or thermos and microwave or kettle access ask any brit tea is a drink made for company if brewing an entire pot seems worthless to you get others in on your action at the workplace brew a pot for your coworkers too get the family roommates in on the routine of a late night cup when it s a social activity you ll be more likely to engage in it start your day with a fresh cup of tea instead of your usual joe tea drinkers can also save calories especially when ordering at a coffee house some coffee house drinks contain hundreds of calories whereas with tea what you see is what you get like mentioned above it s important that you drink your tea straight the addition of milk neutralizes the fat stomping ability of tea the flavonoids what s more research says skim milk is the worst crazy huh this research is on cow s milk if you d like to try soy or almond do so but keep in mind that the same effect may or may not be had sugary or even diet sodas have been known to actually have the opposite effect on weight loss the sodium in diet soda can make you retain water so opt for the smart alternative sugar free iced tea iced tea is also ideal because if you re looking for a little caffeinated pick me up during the afternoon iced or hot tea will give you the same effect without the sugar in regular soda or the sodium in diet much of the power behind drinking tea to lose weight is because you won t be consuming anything else instead tea is low in calories if you do it right and will keep you from downing other higher calorie things it s the same concept as losing weight by drinking water although the chips or cookies in the vending machine may be calling your name make yourself a cup of tea instead if you go for the tea the egcg properties found in green tea actually have a glucose lowering effect which influences cravings and may help control hunger moreover the ritual involved in making tea as opposed to shoving coins into a vending machine gives you a welcome break from your chores or work and you can reflect on good thoughts as well as making conscious choices to put good things into your body instead of empty calories from candy bars take a moment to chat to someone else who is in the tearoom with you and it s a great way to unwind stretch and socialize in the space of five minutes drinking one glass of tea before dinner fills up part of your stomach which means that you ll be less hungry when it comes to food of course eating a healthy dinner is still important cool tea is important too cold tea needs to be heated up by the body in order to be metabolized this expends extra calories meaning more weight loss regardless of your weight loss goal having a warm cup of herbal tea to end the day can help to relax your body and brain because a good night s sleep contributes to shedding weight set yourself up for a successful sleep with tea however don t drink tea too close to bedtime otherwise you ll end up having to make trips to the bathroom and disrupt your sleep especially if you re pregnant or suffering from incontinence issues some experts believe that certain teas should be consumed at different times of day to reap maximum weight loss results while drinking tea at all is good consider drinking different kinds throughout the day to see what works for you white tea may block fat absorption so drink it before lunch a tea like bilberry can balance your glucose levels so it s most useful around dinnertime pu erh green and oolong teas can get your metabolism going so drink them in the morning and throughout the day too much of life these days is spent in some sort of commute make it more enjoyable by turning it into a chance to sit down and drink tea have a thermos or two at your disposal anytime to make it super convenient prepare tea well in advance for the time crunch of your day basically the theme of this article is drink drink drink not only will you not have the chance to put something else in your stomach but you won t want to the more you drink the fuller you ll feel certain teas have caffeine in them sure not like a cup of coffee does but if you re drinking it 24 7 it adds up while caffeine is not technically dehydrating it does have about 50 mg of caffeine per cup you don t want to exceed 300 mg if you can avoid it if you react poorly to caffeine stick to herbal teas that don t have caffeine while this won t be an issue for most people some are particularly caffeine sensitive and high levels of caffeine can lead to insomnia nervousness and prolonged symptoms even hours and hours later let s get real here for a second if you don t see results with a new diet fairly quickly you re not going to stick with it while drinking tea is a great idea you ll get faster results if you have a healthy diet too the two combined will make you a force to be reckoned with you know what tea goes great with whole grains fruits veggies and low fat dairy products since you re brewing your own tea why not cook your own food while you re at it cutting out processed goods and making everything yourself means you know every little thing you re putting in your body your taste buds may get tired of drinking just one type of tea would you want to eat only one food for every meal in order to stick to your routine mix it up and try different teas flavors and enhancements it can be a lot of fun making a tea selection in your home or office cupboard allowing you to choose a tea flavor according to the mood you re in add honey or rock candy sticks to your tea keep in mind though that doing this will go against your initiative to lose weight but a little honey or sweetness may make the tea taste better perhaps as an occasional treat this one won t hurt try a splash of fat free flavored cream or a squirt of lemon for a zestier tea a slice of lemon can help improve the flavor plus one study found that those who drink black tea with lemon peel have 70 percent reduced likelihood of developing skin cancer the sky is the limit when it comes to trying different flavored teas there are many brands and many sources of tea and it s unlikely you ll ever taste them all learning about

melt clean your freezer put the food back in and turn the freezer on again if you are noticing a lot of ice build up in your freezer it may be a sign that something isn t functioning correctly one potential problem is is blocked airflow freezers need to have proper airflow around the cooling coils and vents if any of the freezer s vents or coils are dirty blocked or clogged this could cause an issue with ice build up condenser coils are usually located in the back of the freezer towards the bottom of the refrigerator you ll likely need to remove a panel to access them some refrigerators will have condenser coils that run up and down the entire back of the fridge use a soft brush to gently remove dust and dirt from the coils check the vents inside the freezer itself make sure there is no ice or food items clogging them up your freezer may be too close to a wall to allow for proper ventilation try moving your freezer away from any walls or tight spaces your freezer door should create an airtight seal when it s closed however if the seal itself is old or warped it may be allowing air to flow in and out of the freezer airflow will cause ice to build up rapidly in your freezer check your freezer door s seal to make sure there are no spaces where air is escaping make sure something in the freezer isn t holding the door open a bit there may be a tiny space where air is entering the freezer run your hand along the edge of the seal to feel for any loose or cold areas you may need to replace older magnetic seals if they are no longer functioning you can try wiping the seal down to remove any buildup that may be preventing an airtight lock setting your freezer s temperature either too high or too low can cause excess ice to build up in order to prevent these freezer crystals from accumulating it can be a good idea to take a look at your freezer s thermometer try to adjust the thermometer to an ideal temperature to reduce the amount of ice that is forming in your freezer your freezer should be set to 0 f or 18 c make sure you don t change the temperature by opening the door too often or by not closing it all the way anytime you open the door on your freezer warm air will come rushing in when this warm moist air enters the freezer it will immediately freeze onto any surface it touches always open and close your freezer door quickly to avoid any unnecessary ice build up in your freezer only open the door when you need to put something in or take something out avoid looking too long for something in the freezer only open the door when you are ready to take it out always make sure the door is fully and completely shut when you close it much of the ice that forms in a freezer comes from the moisture in the food in order to help cut down on the amount of ice in your freezer it can be helpful to take air out of any freezer storage bags removing the air will trap the moisture in the food instead of allowing it to escape and turn into ice elsewhere in your freezer squeeze the air out of any plastic freezer bags that you store food in you can use a drinking straw to suck most of the air out of a bag creating a near vacuum seal any resealed bags should be closed tightly leaving little room for air solid containers should be full of food to avoid leaving much space for air make sure any containers with lids are securely shut try to use storage bags that are specifically designed for freezers more air in your freezer will mean more ice build up freezers that are full of food will usually have slower rates of ice buildup than empty ones whenever possible try to keep your freezer well stocked to cut down on the amount of empty space keeping your freezer full will help reduce the amount of freezer crystals you have to contend with storing food in your freezer can be a great way to keep perishable food items safe however storing food too long can cause it to lose its moisture resulting in freezer burn the lost moisture will accumulate inside your freezer and create more ice crystals try to remove food that has been stored for a long time to help prevent the buildup of freezer crystals write the date on something you are adding to your freezer this will help you track how long it s been stored freezer burn will take months to occur try to use or remove items that have been stored for more than a few months most modern freezers will have an automatic defrosting function this feature will automatically remove any freezer crystals that might have built up however older freezers will not have this feature and will require you to manually defrost it check with your freezer s instruction manual to learn more about its features before you defrost your freezer you will need to remove all items from it place your frozen items in another freezer or cold place this will give you room to work with and will prevent frozen items from defrosting after everything is removed including the shelves you can unplug the freezer you may need to use a friend or family member s freezer while you defrost you could also store your food in a cooler while your work to defrost your freezer once your food has been removed from your freezer you ll be ready to defrost however it s a good idea to get ready for the melting ice you ll want something to catch the water as it comes out of the freezer having a good way to catch the melt water can help prevent a big mess get some old rags ready to lay along the front of the freezer these will help soak up ice water as it melts having a bucket handy can help you store the melt water before dumping it keep a mop ready for any water that spills onto the floor once everything is removed from the freezer and it has been unplugged you can begin defrosting find something to hold the door open with allowing warm air into the freezer to melt the ice the goal is to wait for all of the ice to melt or get to a point where it can be removed by gently scraping it away with a spatula you can add a pot of hot water to the freezer to help speed up the defrosting process you might try using a fan to move air in and out of the freezer avoid using a hairdryer as this can be a safety hazard as the ice melts never use anything sharp to break up ice now that the ice has been removed from your freezer and it is completely empty you can give it a good cleaning take a cloth and some gentle cleaning solution and wipe down the inside of the freezer take your time and make your freezer as clean as you can before adding your food back in any mild detergent will work fine for cleaning your freezer you can make a simple cleaner by mixing 3 tablespoons of baking soda into 1 quart of water now that your freezer has been defrosted cleaned and dried you can put your food back in and turn it on again your freezer should run much more efficiently and all of the ice crystals will be gone for a while keep an eye on the build up of ice and defrost again whenever necessary the more you let ice build up in your freezer the longer the defrosting process will take make sure your freezer is totally dry before putting food back in any moisture will refreeze and cause ice to quickly build up again 
query	226	make a blt sandwich basic no frills blt sandwiches couldn t be easier to make the ingredients are right in the name blts or bacon lettuce and tomato sandwiches are simple yet delicious and make a great breakfast brunch or lunch dish in addition because these sandwiches are so simple they re also incredibly easy to modify into hundreds of scrumptious variations if you re ready to fire up your griddle and make a mouthwatering blt see step 1 below to get started making a classic blt making a california blt making a breakfast special blt making a royal blt cook the bacon add your spreads to one slice of bread add a few tomato slices add your lettuce add your bacon place your second piece of bread on top of your sandwich for a double decker add more fillings and another piece of bread assemble a classic blt minus the final piece of bread add a few avocado slices optionally add a spritz of lemon juice add your final piece of bread cook your bacon saving the grease fry an egg in your bacon grease add your fried egg and cheese to your blt add your final piece of bread fry pancetta spread burrata cheese on a brioche bun add arugula add heirloom tomato slices add your cooked pancetta drizzle the top half of the bun with oil and vinegar place the top half of the bun on top of the sandwich if there s one thing that s absolutely positively 100 crucial to a blt it s bacon delicious delectable bacon turn a burner on your stove to medium heat and place a large or medium sized frying pan on it when the pan is hot you ll know it s ready if water flicked on to immediately sizzles add your bacon strips and let them begin to fry use tongs or a long fork to periodically turn your bacon strips as they cook to avoid burning when they have achieved a pleasing brownish color transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels the entire process shouldn t take longer than 10 minutes or so while waiting for your bacon to cook you can proceed to the next few steps to save time just keep an eye on your bacon to make sure it doesn t burn as an alternative to frying you can bake bacon by placing it in a shallow cooking pan and leaving it in an oven set to 375o f 190o c for about 15 to 20 minutes the correct crispiness of bacon is a subject of endless debate among bacon aficionados some people like their bacon soft and chewy while others like it burnt to a crisp ultimately it s up to you the earlier you remove your bacon from the pan the softer it will be next take out two slices of bread and lay them flat on a clean clear cutting board or work area spread mayonnaise or a substitute like miracle whip on one slice of bread then spread mustard over the mayonnaise finally add any optional spreads or condiments that you care for for instance some like to add a little kick to their blts with a splash of tabasco sauce if you like you can toast your bread to give your sandwich a crispy texture before applying your spreads obviously if you don t care for mayonnaise or mustard there s no need to add either to your sandwich you may find that having at least one spread helps your sandwich stick together though it s certainly not necessary next grab a tomato turn it on its side and make a few vertical cuts to produce several circular slices lay these evenly over your bread your tomato layer may be as thick as you like some people like lots of tomatoes while others prefer just a few thin slices you can use whichever type of tomato you like for your blt traditional standard blts are often depicted with large slices of beefsteak tomato but you can also use a more flavorful varieties like heirloom or roma tomatoes if you wish if you haven t already done so wash your lettuce thoroughly in cold water to remove any dirt and make the leaves crisp and cold lay a few leaves of lettuce over your tomatoes again the amount of lettuce you add is up to you many find a leaf or two to be sufficient as with tomatoes the variety of lettuce you use is your choice while many enjoy ordinary iceberg lettuce other types like romaine lettuce are great alternatives you can even use a different green like spinach if you prefer though in this case your sandwich won t technically be a blt if your bacon hasn t finished cooking at this point wait for it to do so when you ve removed it from the stove lay it on a plate lined with paper towels for a few moments to allow any excess grease to be absorbed then transfer the bacon to your sandwich the amount of bacon you use is up to you some folks like a thick mouthful of bacon while others prefer just a taste depending on the size of your bread 3 4 strips is usually enough to provide a satisfying crunch congratulations your sandwich is ready to eat at this point you can either enjoy your delicious blt or continue adding fillings to create a double decker sandwich if your sandwich fillings are stacked too high and your sandwich falls apart when you try to eat it you may want to spear your sandwich with a toothpick to keep it together sometimes an ordinary sandwich just doesn t cut it if you re feeling especially hungry consider adding a second layer of ingredients above your existing sandwich then capping your double decker with a third piece of bread this second layer can contain all of the fillings you ve used thus far or just the ones that you wish for example if we wanted to add a second layer with all of the ingredients in the sandwich we would spread mustard and mayonnaise on top of our current sandwich add a few tomato slices add a leaf of lettuce add a few strips of bacon and finally add another piece of bread on the very top as noted in the intro there are hundreds of ways to make a blt this variation adds a little west coast flair to the standard blt by adding some of the key ingredients in a california club sandwich to start you ll want to build a blt as directed above until the point just before you d normally be finished in other words cook some bacon then spread a little mustard and mayonnaise on your bread and finally add tomato lettuce and your cooked bacon to your sandwich from here we ll be adding a few extra touches to make our sandwich unique for a true west coast classic you may want to consider using sourdough san francisco s signature bread peel and cut a ripe hass avocado into several thick french fry sized slices lay these slices down above your final layer of bacon the avocado gives the sandwich a creamy satisfying quality not present in an ordinary blt the smooth texture of the avocado contrasts especially well with crunchy toast avocados are best when they re ripe ripe hass avocados the most common variety on the west coast have dark green to black skin and a firm yet yielding texture the fruit should feel somewhat weighty and should have no obviously flattened or smooshed patches if you re unsure whether an avocado is ripe check under the brown stem remnant at the bottom of the avocado if the skin underneath is bright yellow green you ve picked a ripe avocado if it s brown your avocado may be bruised or overripe after adding your avocado you may want to squeeze a thin slice of lemon over your sandwich to produce a few drops of lemon juice if you do so be conservative you want just a hint of lemony zest not a blt that makes you pucker if done correctly the blt will have a slight tangy flavor which for some is absolutely mouthwatering when paired with the meatiness of the bacon and the smoothness of the avocado congratulations your california blt is ready to eat if you desire you can add another layer of ingredients and an additional piece of bread to create a double decker if you re looking for a truly californian experience you may want to opt for this california clubs the state s signature sandwich are customarily served as double deckers this blt variation is great for early birds looking for a satisfying sandwich on the way to work to begin start cooking your bacon as normal but when you re finished save some of the grease which will be used for frying an egg if you don t like the idea of frying an egg in bacon grease you may dispose of the grease and instead use another form of fat to fry your egg like butter oil or margarine while you re waiting for your bacon to finish cooking you ll probably want to make the most of your time by doing most of the work to assemble your sandwich lay down a piece of bread add any spreads you desire and add tomato lettuce and bacon when it finishes cooking as above you ll build on this basic blt template to create your new sandwich when you ve transferred all of your bacon out of the frying pan drained it and added it to your sandwich crack an egg over your frying pan wait for your egg to cook to your desired level of hardness monitoring as it cooks to ensure it doesn t overcook or burn see how to fry an egg for specific egg frying techniques essentially you ll want to fry your egg in the pan for several minutes until its edges are white then drop a spoonful of water in the pan next to the egg and cover both the egg and the water with a lid this steams the upper side of the egg ensuring it cooks after this point cook to your desired level of hardness checking under the lid several times to observe your progress transfer the egg out of the pan when it s done you shouldn t ever need to flip it when your egg is finished cooking gently place it on top of your sandwich then add a few slices of your favorite cheese on top of the egg almost any type of cheese pairs well with these ingredients though standard omelet cheeses like cheddar jack and swiss are all safe bets congratulations your breakfast special blt is ready to eat the fried egg and cheese make this hearty satisfying meal that tastes something like an entire american breakfast in one sandwich if you re eating on the go bring a napkin the egg yolk can be quite runny depending on how you ve cooked it for the blt variations above we ve stuck to the same basic template bread spreads tomato lettuce bacon and bread as far as the specifics of these ingredients are concerned we ve left the choices up to you you may have used anything from white bread to rye supermarket bacon to gourmet butcher s cuts and so on however with this dignified elegant recipe there s no settling for standard fare start by frying up some high quality pancetta for a taste that s second to none pancetta is an italian variety of bacon that is unsmoked by contrast most american bacon is smoked and often flavored with various aromatics pancetta is cooked in the exact same way as bacon either fried several minutes per side in a pan or baked in the oven rather than opting for the standard bread and mustard mayonnaise combo for this sandwich this time we ll use more indulgent ingredients cut a gourmet brioche bun in half and spread fresh burrata cheese on the bottom half be generous with your burrata unlike mustard and mayo you can get away with applying a fairly thick spread here brioche is a rich tender french pastry bread made with a high egg and butter content this bread is sweet light and fluffy which allows it to contrast with the heavier flavors in the sandwich burrata cheese is a soft cheese made from mozzarella and cream that makes a creamy luxurious spread for blts and many other sandwiches the outer portion of the cheese is often pure mozzarella while the inside is the characteristic mixture of cheese and cream use the inside portion for spreading next on top of your tomato slices sprinkle a handful of arugula greens since arugula comes in the form of many small leaves rather than one or two large leaves like lettuce it can be tricky to get them to stay in the sandwich however if you put the arugula into your sandwich now before you add the tomatoes the leaves will be held in place by the sticky burrata cheese ensuring a tidy or at the very least tidier sandwich sometimes called rocket greens arugula is a more nutritious alternative to ordinary iceberg lettuce arugula also has a somewhat nutty peppery taste and a noticeable fragrance making it a stimulating addition to almost any sandwich next you ll want to add flavorful slices of tomato to your sandwich while there are many valid choices heirloom tomatoes sometimes called heritage tomatoes are a great bet these tomatoes frequently described as rich and or rustic have a splotchy appearance that can range from yellowish to red to green or even brown and have a sweeter more succulent flavor than ordinary varieties note that heirloom tomatoes don t keep particularly well so buying fresh when possible is best at this point if you ve been cooking your pancetta while you ve been assembling your sandwich it should be almost done when the pancetta is finished cooking remove it from the pan and allow it to drain on a plate lined with paper towels after draining for a few moments move the pancetta to your sandwich you may add as much as you like but as with bacon 3 4 pieces is often enough we re almost done with our gourmet blt add a final tangy savory garnish to your burger by making your own vinaigrette from oil and vinegar combine three parts olive oil and one part balsamic vinegar in a small bowl use very small amounts of each aim to make no more than a few spoonfuls of vinaigrette total drizzle about a spoonful of your vinaigrette evenly over the top bun if you have leftover vinaigrette don t drench your bun using too much can make your sandwich a sloppy mess instead combine it with leftover arugula for an improvised side salad at last you re done turn your top bun over and enjoy your premium top of the line sandwich as a side try using the aforementioned arugula and vinaigrette salad or for a decadent alternative some homemade fries 
query	227	solve systems of differential equations the article on solving differential equations goes over different types of differential equations and how to solve them however it only covers single equations this article takes the concept of solving differential equations one step further and attempts to explain how to solve systems of differential equations a system of differential equations is a set of two or more equations where there exists coupling between the equations when coupling exists the equations can no longer be solved independently homogeneous systems real and distinct eigenvalues complex eigenvalues degenerate eigenvalues matrix exponentials distinct eigenvalues degenerate eigenvalues write the system of differential equations in matrix form find the eigenvalues of the matrix go through the three cases find the eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalues arrive at the general solution write the eigenvalues in terms of their real and imaginary components find the eigenvector associated with one eigenvalue write out the first term of the solution to the system use euler s formula to split the imaginary exponential into its trigonometric components multiply out the expression try to find all eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalue use the cayley hamilton theorem to find the generalized eigenvector find the generalized eigenvector solve for w displaystyle mathbf w consider the matrix equation x ax displaystyle mathbf x a mathbf x find eat displaystyle e at diagonalize a displaystyle a find edt displaystyle e dt and then multiply everything all out try to diagonalize a displaystyle a if however the matrix is not diagonalizable we appeal to the consequences of the cayley hamilton theorem again find the eigenvalues eigenvectors and generalized eigenvectors find the jordan normal form of a displaystyle a for example consider the system of equations written below x1 3x1 5x2x2 x1 x2 displaystyle begin aligned x 1 3x 1 5x 2 x 2 x 1 x 2 end aligned we consider the variables x1 x1 t displaystyle x 1 x 1 t and x2 x2 t displaystyle x 2 x 2 t and their respective derivatives to be functions of t displaystyle t from linear algebra any system of equations such as this one can be written in matrix form x ax displaystyle mathbf x a mathbf x in general one also considers a forcing term b t displaystyle mathbf b t which may or may not be time dependent but in this section we focus only on the homogeneous case where this term is 0 x1 x2 351 1 x1x2 displaystyle begin pmatrix x 1 x 2 end pmatrix begin pmatrix 3 5 1 1 end pmatrix begin pmatrix x 1 x 2 end pmatrix first we find the characteristic equation det a i 0 displaystyle operatorname det a lambda i 0 a useful formula for finding the characteristic equation of a 2 2 displaystyle 2 times 2 matrix is 2 tr a det a 0 displaystyle lambda 2 operatorname tr a lambda operatorname det a 0 where tr displaystyle operatorname tr denotes the trace of the matrix the sum of the main diagonal elements 3 51 1 2 2 8 0 displaystyle begin vmatrix 3 lambda 5 1 1 lambda end vmatrix lambda 2 2 lambda 8 0 solve for the eigenvalues this quadratic equation can be factored in general use the quadratic formula in this article we label the two eigenvalues as 1 displaystyle lambda 1 and 2 displaystyle lambda 2 1 4 displaystyle lambda 1 4 2 2 displaystyle lambda 2 2 the eigenvalues are real and distinct from linear algebra finding the eigenvectors in this case is easy as the eigenvectors should span the space with a dimension equal to the dimension of the matrix our example has two real and distinct eigenvalues which we solve in the next section the eigenvalues are complex we only need to deal with one eigenvector for reasons we discuss later the eigenvalues are degenerate they have multiplicity of order 2 or higher it is sometimes the case that degenerate eigenvalues of a matrix end up having eigenvectors that span a space with dimension equal to the degeneracy multiplicity of the eigenvalue for example an eigenvalue with degeneracy two may end up having two linearly independent eigenvectors however it is also entirely possible that the degenerate eigenvalue has an eigenspace that fails to span with a dimension equal to the degeneracy in order to rectify this situation we must introduce the concept of generalized eigenvectors discussed later to do so substitute an eigenvalue into the matrix a i displaystyle a lambda i and row reduce for 2 2 displaystyle 2 times 2 matrices the second row is always a linear combination of the first row and so the row reduction is trivial for higher dimensional matrices the linear dependence of the rows and columns is less obvious 1 4 151 5 1500 displaystyle lambda 1 4 begin pmatrix 1 5 1 5 end pmatrix to begin pmatrix 1 5 0 0 end pmatrix this matrix tells us that x1 5x2 displaystyle x 1 5x 2 setting x2 t displaystyle x 2 t to be a free variable we see that x1 5t displaystyle x 1 5t because t displaystyle t can be set to anything we opt to set t 1 displaystyle t 1 for convenience and arrive at the eigenvector v1 51 displaystyle mathbf v 1 begin pmatrix 5 1 end pmatrix we do this with all other eigenvalues as well therefore the eigenvector associated with eigenvalue 2 2 displaystyle lambda 2 2 is v2 11 displaystyle mathbf v 2 begin pmatrix 1 1 end pmatrix below c1 displaystyle c 1 and c2 displaystyle c 2 are arbitrary constants x c1e4t 51 c2e 2t 11 displaystyle mathbf x c 1 e 4t begin pmatrix 5 1 end pmatrix c 2 e 2t begin pmatrix 1 1 end pmatrix in general we have eigenvalues 1 displaystyle lambda 1 and 2 displaystyle lambda 2 with their corresponding eigenvectors x c1e 1tv1 c2e 2tv2 displaystyle mathbf x c 1 e lambda 1 t mathbf v 1 c 2 e lambda 2 t mathbf v 2 the fundamental theorem of algebra guarantees that for polynomial equations with real coefficients the solutions are real numbers or come in complex conjugates this implies that if a bi displaystyle lambda a bi is a solution to the characteristic equation then a bi displaystyle lambda a bi is also a solution similarly if v displaystyle mathbf v is the eigenvector associated with eigenvalue displaystyle lambda then v displaystyle mathbf v is an eigenvector associated with eigenvalue displaystyle lambda the solution to the system of differential equations can therefore be written out as a linear combination of the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvector associated with eigenvalue displaystyle lambda this is why we only need to deal with one eigenvalue let s consider a system with matrix a 2 51 2 displaystyle a begin pmatrix 2 5 1 2 end pmatrix this matrix has eigenvalues of i displaystyle lambda pm i we still row reduce here just as with the real and distinct eigenvalue case but the complex numbers mean that it is no longer immediately obvious that there exists linear dependency between the rows and columns nevertheless if our work is correct it is guaranteed that there be linear dependence so for 2 2 displaystyle 2 times 2 matrices we can again row reduce trivially here we first swap rows and then row reduce we then set x2 displaystyle x 2 as a free variable solve for x1 displaystyle x 1 and set t 1 displaystyle t 1 for convenience just as before i 2 i 51 2 i 1 2 i00 displaystyle lambda i begin pmatrix 2 i 5 1 2 i end pmatrix to begin pmatrix 1 2 i 0 0 end pmatrix v 2 i1 displaystyle mathbf v begin pmatrix 2 i 1 end pmatrix this first term is analogous to the form of the solution where the eigenvalues are both real and distinct in general we would have e t e a bi t displaystyle e lambda t e a bi t as the exponential eitv displaystyle e it mathbf v in general our eigenvalue is of the form a bi displaystyle lambda a bi so we would also have a real exponential out in front eit cos t isin t displaystyle e it cos t i sin t cos t isin t 2 i1 displaystyle cos t i sin t begin pmatrix 2 i 1 end pmatrix remember that i2 1 displaystyle i 2 1 cos t isin t 2 i1 2cos t 2isin t icos t sin tcos t isin t displaystyle cos t i sin t begin pmatrix 2 i 1 end pmatrix begin pmatrix 2 cos t 2i sin t i cos t sin t cos t i sin t end pmatrix the general solution is the linear combination of the real and imaginary parts of this vector x c1 2cos t sin tcos t c2 2sin t cos tsin t displaystyle mathbf x c 1 begin pmatrix 2 cos t sin t cos t end pmatrix c 2 begin pmatrix 2 sin t cos t sin t end pmatrix as mentioned previously it is sometimes the case that there are n displaystyle n linearly independent eigenvectors associated with an eigenvalue of degeneracy of order n displaystyle n this always occurs when the matrix a displaystyle a is hermitian if this is the case then proceed to solve the system according to the real and distinct eigenvalues case if not then continue here consider the matrix a 31 4 1 displaystyle a begin pmatrix 3 1 4 1 end pmatrix this matrix has eigenvalue 1 displaystyle lambda 1 with degeneracy of order 2 using the methods outlined in previous sections we find that there exists only one eigenvector v 12 displaystyle mathbf v begin pmatrix 1 2 end pmatrix our eigenspace fails to span the space of dimension 2 this is a problem recall that the general solution to a second order differential equation with repeated roots in its characteristic equation involved multiplying a term by t displaystyle t in order to achieve linear independence if we substitute this solution x te ta displaystyle mathbf x te lambda t mathbf a as an ansatz we obtain a system of equations one of which a 0 displaystyle mathbf a 0 is untenable with the requirement that an eigenvector be non zero one of the solutions must therefore include another vector w displaystyle mathbf w which we find momentarily the cayley hamilton theorem says that every matrix satisfies its own characteristic polynomial that is if p displaystyle p lambda is a characteristic polynomial in displaystyle lambda then replacing displaystyle lambda with the matrix a displaystyle a itself must give the zero matrix try it for the matrix above this is a deep result implying that every vector space must be spanned by a linear combination of the eigenvectors v displaystyle mathbf v and the generalized eigenvectors w displaystyle mathbf w so even though these generalized eigenvectors are not eigenvectors of a displaystyle a i e they do not lie in the null space of a i displaystyle a lambda i they can be chosen such that they lie in the null space of a i 2 displaystyle a lambda i 2 hence generalized in general they may lie in the null space of a i n displaystyle a lambda i n for an eigenvalue with degeneracy of order n displaystyle n we know that a i 2w 0 displaystyle a lambda i 2 mathbf w 0 then it follows that since a i v 0 displaystyle a lambda i mathbf v 0 we obtain the following important relation this is the formula to find the generalized eigenvector given an eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue of degeneracy 2 this formula is shown to work if we act both sides by a i displaystyle a lambda i a i w v displaystyle a lambda i mathbf w mathbf v solving this with row reduction for the 2 2 displaystyle 2 times 2 case is again trivial setting a free variable w2 t displaystyle w 2 t and setting it to 0 for convenience we have the generalized eigenvector below w 1 20 displaystyle mathbf w begin pmatrix 1 2 0 end pmatrix the general solution to our system is given below x c1et 12 c2 tet 12 et 1 20 displaystyle mathbf x c 1 e t begin pmatrix 1 2 end pmatrix c 2 left te t begin pmatrix 1 2 end pmatrix e t begin pmatrix 1 2 0 end pmatrix right in general we have the following formula x c1e tv c2 te tv e tw displaystyle mathbf x c 1 e lambda t mathbf v c 2 left te lambda t mathbf v e lambda t mathbf w right in each of these cases one obtains two arbitrary constants c1 displaystyle c 1 and c2 displaystyle c 2 given initial conditions when t 0 displaystyle t 0 one can easily solve for the constants what will result is a system of algebraic equations recall that if the variables x displaystyle mathbf x and a displaystyle a were scalars then the solution to this differential equation would be ceat displaystyle ce at so the solution to x ax displaystyle mathbf x a mathbf x is in the form of a matrix exponential up to a constant eat i at at 22 at 33 displaystyle e at i at frac at 2 2 frac at 3 3 cdots given initial conditions x 0 x0 displaystyle mathbf x 0 mathbf x 0 the solution is x eatx0 displaystyle mathbf x e at mathbf x 0 for distinct real and complex eigenvalues one can use the formulas given below where eat e 1tb e 2tc displaystyle e at e lambda 1 t b e lambda 2 t c these formulas have the advantage of not needing to care about the eigenvectors b a 2i 1 2 c i b displaystyle b frac a lambda 2 i lambda 1 lambda 2 c i b however finding the matrix exponential is made easier through diagonalization a pdp 1 displaystyle a pdp 1 where p displaystyle p is the change of basis matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of a displaystyle a and d displaystyle d has the eigenvalues of a displaystyle a along its main diagonal in the same order as their corresponding eigenvectors in p displaystyle p consider the matrix 351 1 displaystyle begin pmatrix 3 5 1 1 end pmatrix to diagonalize we find the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors d displaystyle d has the eigenvalues on the main diagonal p displaystyle p has the eigenvectors as its columns the order of the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues must match 351 1 16 5 111 400 2 11 15 displaystyle begin pmatrix 3 5 1 1 end pmatrix frac 1 6 begin pmatrix 5 1 1 1 end pmatrix begin pmatrix 4 0 0 2 end pmatrix begin pmatrix 1 1 1 5 end pmatrix the advantage of diagonalization is that diagonal matrices are easier to work with here taking the exponential of a diagonal matrix is equivalent to taking the exponential of the individual elements of the matrix eat pedtp 1 displaystyle e at pe dt p 1 eat 16 5 111 e4t00e 2t 11

begin pmatrix 5e 4t e 2t 5e 4t 5e 2t e 4t e 2t e 4t 5e 2t end pmatrix end aligned if we include the constant vector c displaystyle mathbf c we can disregard the extra 1 6 displaystyle 1 6 factor out front although this solution may not look like the solution we found previously it is equivalent if we make the transformation c1 c2 c1 displaystyle c 1 c 2 to c 1 and c1 5c2 c2 displaystyle c 1 5c 2 to c 2 thus if eat displaystyle e at is found then your work is pretty much over once again if it so happens that you find degenerate eigenvalues and the matrix is still diagonalizable then all is

query	228	make hot buttered cider there are many different ways to make hot apple cider hot buttered cider which is distinguished from other types by the inclusion of butter is a particularly enjoyable option even within the realm of hot buttered ciders you ve got plenty of options in terms of ingredients and specific preparation methods for instance you can include alcohol in your recipe such as the classic hot buttered rum you can also make non alcoholic hot buttered cider with a variety of unique ingredients mulling cider and making spiced butter including alcohol in hot buttered cider embellishing your hot buttered cider select your cider choose a blend of spices yourself mull the cider with your chosen spices make spiced butter add butter to your cider just before serving make a batch of buttered cider with rum use bourbon for a boozier spicier cocktail blend together a party sized batch with apple brandy garnish with flavor enhancing spices include additional ingredients add a salt rim the most important component of a hot buttered cider is the cider itself since you ll be heating the cider with spices or mulling it choose a cider with a thick cloudy body choose an unfiltered cider that s as fresh as possible during the fall look at your local farmer s market to find the best options in your area note that mulling your cider with some or all of the spices you want to use before adding the butter will provide a more satisfying complex and enjoyable beverage though store bought mulling blends are available you ll get a better flavor by the spices you want to use by hand and customizing how much you want of each there are of course a few reliable spices that pair especially well with cider and of course with butter use cinnamon to add sweetness and spice star anise can also be used for similar effect with the additional flavor attribute of licorice clove will add depth to the flavor of the cider itself which will be reduced by the mulling process include coriander to emphasize the muskiness of the cider and add a bit of a citrus kick add a bit of cardamom as well this will enhance the aroma of the cider allspice and nutmeg are also common ingredients in mulled cider drinks while they are enjoyable and reliable don t consider them absolutely necessary and take care not to use too much the best method for making hot buttered cider involves mulling the cider first and adding butter just before serving mulling cider beforehand allows you to cook the flavor of the spices into the cider to do so simmer the cider and spices together for about thirty minutes use whole spices whenever possible for instance toss a few cinnamon sticks into the cider instead of using ground cinnamon include a few fresh orange or lemon peels in the mulling process for spices that are already ground default to about teaspoon per 16 fluid ounces of cider if you re on the fence about amounts of certain spices always default to less this will allow the flavor of the apples themselves to show through however you choose to mull your cider you can make a spiced butter to emphasize certain flavors in your hot buttered cider for instance you may prefer to mull your cider with only citrus peels and cinnamon sticks and make a spiced butter with the other spices you ve chosen such as ground allspice and nutmeg for one option soften 8 ounces of unsalted butter and whip until creamy in a mixing bowl add 2 ounces of brown sugar teaspoon of cinnamon teaspoon of allspice and a pinch of ground clove after mixing in your spices re roll the butter into a log or press it into a small bowl cover the butter and refrigerate it if you re not ready to use it the main advantages of making spiced butter is having more control over the amount of butter and spice in each serving for instance you can make individual portions that have more or less butter and spice you can also make a large batch of spiced butter to use in several different batches of mulled cider over the course of a few days if you ve just mulled the cider and it s still warm you can simply add regular butter or spiced butter the amount of butter you ll want to add depends on the amount of cider you plan to serve aim for about a small spoonful of butter per serving you can melt the butter into the pot containing the whole batch of cider or allow people to add butter themselves to individual servings if adding butter yourself stir it into the cider while the batch simmers over low heat adding butter to individual servings allows everyone to customize their drink and to decided whether to stir their butter until it s fully melted or allow the butter to slowly melt while it floats on the surface of their beverage always serve hot buttered cider when it is still steaming be sure to warn everyone that the drink is hot hot buttered rum can be made a few different ways but is arguably best when cider is used for a batch that will yield eight servings gather a half gallon unfiltered apple cider 1 stick unsalted butter cup dark brown sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon nutmeg teaspoon ground cloves teaspoon salt add the butter brown sugar and spices to the cider as it simmers in a pot with the burner set to low stir until the butter and the sugar are entirely dissolved use a ladle to serve the hot buttered cider into individual mugs adding rum as desired the amount and type of rum you use is up to you the darker the rum the more likely it will add sweetness to the drink substituting rum for bourbon essentially provides a twist on an old classic for a strong two serving batch use 1 cup cider 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon honey teaspoon each of cloves cinnamon and ginger and 4 ounces of bourbon mix the butter and spices until fully combined simmer the cider in a saucepan over low heat and whisk in the butter mixture until it is fully melted remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the bourbon split the beverage into two portions and serve while still they are still steaming for a punch bowl s worth of servings try a recipe that uses 3 cups apple brandy 7 tablespoons brown sugar stick butter 12 cups unfiltered apple cider and cup fresh lemon juice bring the brandy brown sugar and butter to simmer over medium heat stirring until fully blended add the cider lemon juice and 12 cinnamon sticks and bring to a brief boil serve in a large bowl with a ladle make sure everyone knows that there s alcohol in the beverage and encourage everyone to make sure they get a cinnamon stick aside from the all but mandatory cinnamon sticks there are several other spices that you can use to enhance your enjoyment of hot buttered cider whole cloves and grated nutmeg are especially aromatic dried anise seeds are another good option feel free to be as creative as you want with the recipe there are all sorts of potentially enjoyable additions you can make for instance for a sweeter beverage mix in a bit of maple syrup for a batch with a citrus kick zest lemon into your batch just before serving especially if you make a sweeter batch of hot buttered cider such as a rum cider with maple syrup a salt rim can add another level of flavor and visual appeal rub a lemon slice upon the rim of the glasses you ll use and dip the edges in salt 
query	229	treat skin allergies in golden retrievers skin allergies are common in dogs a common skin disease called canine atopic dermatitis cad is especially common in golden retrievers cad causes very itchy skin due to the immune system s response to environmental allergens substances causing allergies like dust or pollen coming into contact with the skin 1 cad can make your golden retriever feel pretty miserable after your vet has diagnosed your golden retriever with cad start treatment as soon as possible although there is no cure for cad several long term treatment options are available to help your golden retriever feel much less itchy reducing exposure to allergens bathing your golden retriever treating skin allergies with antihistamines treating skin allergies with steroids treating skin allergies with cyclosporine using immunotherapy to treat skin allergies limit your golden retriever s time outside minimize exposure to dust and dust mites reduce mold levels in your home use a medicated pet specific shampoo bathe your golden retriever regularly apply a conditioner after the bath consult with your vet about treatment with antihistamines administer the antihistamine as prescribed try several antihistamines discuss steroid treatment with your vet follow treatment instructions monitor your golden retriever for side effects use other skin allergy therapies with steroids discuss cyclosporine treatment with your vet administer cyclosporine as prescribed wait for a response to therapy schedule follow up visits with your vet ask your vet how immunotherapy works have your vet perform the immunotherapy injections wait for a treatment response one of the best ways to treat cad is to reduce exposure to environmental allergens for example if your golden retriever is allergic to pollen keep your dog inside more often especially when pollen counts are high when your golden retriever does need to go outside wipe it down with a wet cloth afterwards to remove the pollen from its fur and skin pay special attention to wiping off your golden retriever s paws your dog could lick its paws or touch another part of its body with the paws and trigger an allergic reaction reducing exposure can be effective if your vet identified the specific culprit allergen without knowing the specific allergen reducing exposure would be very difficult if your golden retriever is allergic to dust or dust mites several avoidance strategies are available for example dust and vacuum your home frequently at least once a week in addition wash your golden retriever s bedding in hot water regularly changing your air filters regularly according to product instructions will also help keep dust out of the air in your home other strategies to reduce exposure to dust and dust mites are placing a plastic cover over your dog s bedusing the air conditioner when it s hot outsidekeeping your golden retriever in non carpeted rooms such as the kitchenkeeping your golden retriever out of recently vacuumed areasnot giving your golden retriever stuffed toys to play with since they could accumulate dust mold is another common allergen associated with cad if your golden retriever is allergic to mold consider using dehumidifiers which reduce humidity in the air dehumidifiers are available at home supply stores also avoid having houseplants since the soil of potted plants can get moldy keeping your golden retriever out of the basement and avoiding dusty pet foods can also reduce mold exposure if you do have house plants put activated charcoal on the soil to prevent mold development look for activated charcoal at your local gardening store clean your dehumidifiers according to the product s instructions cleaning them will help them work more effectively bathing your golden retriever is an important component of treating cad since it will remove allergens that may have settled on your dog s fur if your golden retriever has scratched its skin so much that it has become infected a medicated shampoo will help treat those infected skin lesions medicated shampoo will contain either an antimicrobial or antifungal ingredient medicated shampoos often contain oatmeal or essential fatty acids to keep the skin from drying out purchase the medicated shampoo at your vet s office do not use a human shampoo to bathe your dog dog skin and human skin have different ph levels because of the ph differences human shampoo could irritate your golden retriever s skin to help your golden retriever feel less itchy bathe it either once a week or every other week even if your golden retriever feels really itchy do not bathe it too frequently more than once a week this could strip its skin of essential oils causing dry skin if your golden retriever still seems uncomfortably itchy with weekly or bi weekly bathing talk with your vet about how often you should bathe your dog consider rinsing or wiping down your golden retriever each day this would remove the allergens in between baths however this may not be practical if you have a busy schedule you could also use a topical anti inflammatory product between baths on the itchy spots this product which would contain a steroid like hydrocortisone would be available at your vet s office if your golden retriever has skin lesions wash very gently around those areas since they may be very sensitive to the touch when you finish bathing your golden retriever apply a leave in conditioner to the skin and coat this conditioner will not only soothe the skin but also serve as a barrier to keep allergens from contacting the skin apply the conditioner according to the product label instructions use a pet safe conditioner antihistamines are commonly used to treat allergies in dogs they work by blocking the release of histamine from mast cells cells involved in allergic reactions antihistamines work best in dogs with seasonal or mild skin allergies if this describes your golden retriever s cad then your vet will probably prescribe an antihistamine antihistamines are effective in about 30 of dogs with cad antihistamines are inexpensive and have very few side effects antihistamines work best when given consistently not just as needed if you give your golden retriever the antihistamine after an allergic reaction has started then it s already too late the antihistamine needs to be in your dog s system before the mast cells have a chance to release histamine your vet will probably want you to give your golden retriever an antihistamine two to three times daily antihistamines for dogs are given by mouth antihistamines do not work the same in every dog for this reason your vet may recommend trying up to three antihistamines before moving on to a different type of therapy examples of dog safe antihistamines are benadryl zyrtec and claritin these are human over the counter antihistamines but their dosages can be adjusted to be effective in dogs note that the active medication in benadryl can vary depending on the country always check with a vet to make sure the key component of any antihistamine is safe try each antihistamine for 10 14 days your golden retriever may need a higher dose of antihistamine than a human would need before using these over the counter antihistamines ask your vet what dosage of antihistamine your dog will need with each antihistamine contact your vet to let them know if your golden retriever s symptoms are getting any better your golden retriever may still be itchy with antihistamine therapy however the itchiness will probably be less than what it was before steroids are anti inflammatory by decreasing inflammation steroids help a dog with cad feel less itchy however steroids have serious long term side effects including increased drinking and urinating liver enlargement high blood pressure and a weakened immune system because cad requires lifelong therapy you and your vet will need to discuss the safest way to use steroids to treat your golden retriever s cad even though steroids rapidly reduce itching and inflammation your vet s goal may be to limit or even eliminate the use of steroids for your golden retriever prednisone is a type of steroid used to treat cad steroids can be given as short term relief for flare ups temporary episodes of itchiness they can also be given for the duration of an allergy season as long as the season is short a few months or less as a third option steroids can be given as long term low dose therapy your vet will determine which type of steroid therapy your golden retriever will need if your golden retriever needs long term steroid therapy your vet may prescribe a low dosage to be given every other day your vet would start with an initial dosage then gradually decrease that dosage as your golden retriever s symptoms improve do not make changes to the steroid dosage on your own this could make treatment more challenging if your golden retriever is on long term steroid therapy monitoring for side effects is very important in addition to observing your dog at home your vet will want to see your dog regularly to analyze blood and urine samples for example because steroids can cause liver enlargement your vet will want to look for increased levels of liver enzymes in your dog s blood if you notice any side effects e g drinking and urinating more often diarrhea increased panting at home contact your vet right away you do not have to wait until your regularly scheduled appointment to have your golden retriever examined in addition to steroids your vet may prescribe other medications such as antihistamines with the goal of limiting or eliminating steroid use follow prescription instructions for these other medications your vet will determine if the other medications are working well enough to start phasing out the steroids from the treatment plan your vet may recommend a drug called cyclosporine which is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug unlike steroids long term cyclosporine therapy is generally well tolerated by dogs however cyclosporine is expensive especially for large breed dogs fortunately as a dog starts to respond to cyclosporine therapy the required dosage would decrease therefore the cost of cyclosporine therapy would decrease over time talk with your vet if you are concerned about the overall cost of cyclosporine atopica is the brand name for cyclosporine that is used in dogs cyclosporine is an oral drug initially it is usually given daily for 4 6 weeks then the dosage is gradually decreased to the lowest effective dose give the cyclosporine on an empty stomach cyclosporine can cause several side effects including vomiting and diarrhea side effects usually occur within the first two weeks of therapy contact your vet if you observe these side effects your vet may recommend stopping the cyclosporine for a few days then restarting it by giving it with a small amount of food if there s no diarrhea and vomiting after a few days go back to giving cyclosporine on an empty stomach infections and thickening of the gums are rare side effects of cyclosporine unlike the rapid treatment response with steroids it may take 6 8 weeks before your golden retriever responds to cyclosporine therapy even if you become impatient with waiting for a treatment response do not change the cyclosporine dosage on your own this could lead to treatment failure which could make your golden retriever feel even itchier because cyclosporine decreases the immune response your golden retriever s immune system function may go down your vet will want to check your golden retriever s white blood cell count regularly to assess the health of its immune system if the white blood cell counts are low your vet may need to adjust the cyclosporine dosage these follow up visits will also allow your vet to determine how well your golden retriever is responding to therapy immunotherapy also called allergen specific immunotherapy asit is usually the best choice for treating cad it can help your golden retriever achieve remission no visible signs of cad without the use of other medications e g steroids antihistamines asit works by gradually desensitizing your dog s immune system to the allergens causing the cad the immunotherapy medicine commonly given by injection contains small amounts of the specific allergens to which your golden retriever is allergic by exposing your golden retriever to small measured amounts of the allergens rather than a large uncontrolled amount in the environment your dog s immune system would slowly become more tolerant of the allergens over time therefore lessening the allergic reaction results of the skin tests your vet performed to diagnose cad would indicate the specific allergens immunotherapy is most helpful for dogs that have skin allergies for longer than two to three months at a time and have not responded well to other skin allergy medications it is a lifelong treatment immunotherapy injections are usually given about once every one to four weeks your vet will let you know how often your golden retriever will need the injections it may help to schedule several appointments at one time to make sure your dog receives stays on schedule with the treatment at the beginning of immunotherapy your vet will increase the dosage of allergens until a maintenance dosage is reached your vet will determine the maintenance dosage and keep your golden retriever at this dosage level your vet may change the frequency of injections during the course of therapy this may be the hardest part of immunotherapy since it may take anywhere from a few months to a full year before a dog responds to this type of therapy because your golden retriever will not respond to immunotherapy very quickly your vet will recommend treating your dog with other skin allergy medications during the course of immunotherapy before starting immunotherapy your vet will probably ask that you commit to this treatment for at least 1 year to see if it will work approximately 60 75 of dogs on immunotherapy will experience a 50 improvement in symptoms this amount of improvement could mean that a dog does not need to be on other skin allergy medications
