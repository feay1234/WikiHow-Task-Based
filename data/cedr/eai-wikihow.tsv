query	INEX_LD-2009039	recognize victorian architecture  victorian architecture refers to buildings constructed during the reign of the english monarch, victoria  1837 1901 . the period was characterised by a revival of traditional and historical architectural features. the victorians were fascinated by ancient cultures and sought to incorporate greek, roman, middle eastern and asian styles in to their buildings. following are 10 clues to look for that suggest a building is victorian in origin.  steps look for stained glass. look for mechanized brickwork, or uniformed bricks. spot bay windows. understand the importance of slate.transportation options for moving materials in large quantity were limited prior to the invention of the steam engine, and so buildings were usually constructed using local materials. check the roof for ornate elements. note if you see iron railings. note any homemade qualities to the structure. understand geometric tiling. look closely for cavity walls. find sash windows on the building.  non religious stained glass is often seen in victorian buildings, a result of a revival of the gothic style commonplace in european churches. in particular look out for floral and geometric patterns of stained glass surrounding entrance doors to domestic buildings.    the industrial revolution led to mechanized brickwork. the sharper, more uniform bricks allowed for a tighter construction and cleaner fa ade on buildings, and the process allowed for more variation in types of brick.   victorians took advantage of this to create intricate patterns of different coloured brickwork in their buildings. in particular look out for variations in the use of the  header   the short end of the brick  and the  stretcher   the long side of the brick  to create yet more pattern types.    canted bay windows  straight front and angled sides  became popular in the victorian era as developments in construction methods and manufacturing made more elaborate building elements more accessible for domestic architecture.      the proliferation of railways and canals during the victorian period opened up more options for builders and architects, and slate was one material that experienced a boom as a result. slate was shipped around the country from quarries in wales, cumbria and cornwall for roofing and cladding.    what better way to finish off your new slate roof than an ornate finial  an architectural device that adorns the apex of a gable . finials were born out of the victorian love of religious architecture and allowed everybody to have their own spire like construction on the roof of their house.   these finials were often very ornate in design, mimicking gothic and rococo styles, either flora or fauna, and often mythical such as dragons.    similarly ornate in design are the iron railings that were often seen at the front of urban victorian houses. the industrial revolution made ironwork much more affordable and accessible for domestic architecture and victorians used iron railings to create an impressive welcome at the front of their properties.   the railings were often elaborately decorated with sculptural finials atop the spears. in london, iron railings are particularly linked to the victorian era, as upon prince albert s death in 1861  victoria s consort  the railings of the city were painted black in mourning. the majority of railings in the city have remained this colour ever since.    at odds with the mass production and severity of the industrial age, victorians warmed to the much more  home made  aesthetic of the arts and crafts movement  particularly towards the end of victoria s reign .   common in more rural towns and villages, this style drew on local materials and craftsmanship, and laid bare for all to see the function of the materials and construction. the beauty of this style came from the hand crafted quality of the workmanship rather than any elaborate decoration or adornment.    production methods made decorative clay tiles more accessible, and beautiful hallways and verandas created from colourful geometric tiles can be seen in many victorian houses of the period.    less easy to spot than the others on this list perhaps, but the victorians introduced the cavity wall to domestic architecture.   this method of building two  skins  of brick to create the outer walls of a building creates a cost effective method of insulating from outside temperatures and moisture.    perhaps the most beloved aspect of victorian domestic architecture for modern inhabitants are the large, heavy sash windows. although they were certainly around prior to the victorian era, sash windows were not commonplace in houses until the production of sheet glass was introduced in the 1830s.   this allowed for larger windows with fewer, thinner bars. the  sash  element of the window refers to the opening mechanism. created using internally run cords, the sash mechanism literally  hangs  the bottom half of the window construction from the top. this allows the bottom section to slide up in front  behind the top section, and a counterbalance system holds the window in place.

query	INEX_LD-2010057	learn and understand the quantum theory of matter and radiation  this article is an overview about the theory of quantum material and quantum radiation.  steps understand what is the quantum theory of matter and radiation. know why this theory was formulated. understand why this theory works well. learn the basic equation of quantum motion. understand the controversial concept of zero point energy in quantum systems. know the applications of this theory to other fields of physics. know the effect of variable speed of the light on current theories of physics. learn how current theories of physics should be modified.  the quantum theory of matter and electromagnetic radiation was formulated in the beginning of the 19th century in response to conflicting results of experiments that were done in physics of atomic material. the theory of classical motion by isaac newton was the prevalent theory of classical bodies motion such as the motion of bodies under the influence of the gravitational field the earth. these laws of newton were used to explain phenomena such as rocket propulsion and building of skyscrapers.   these laws worked fine for systems on macroscopic scales. certain experiments in physics that were done on the atomic scale could not be rationalized based on the laws of classical motion by isaac newton. an example is the explanation of the black body radiation. this is a theoretical model that is used to model and simulate the physics of remote stars such as the prediction of their temperature and their atomic content. the theoretical models of the black body radiation could not fit the experimental results appropriately using the laws of newton.  suggestions to quantize the energy terms in these equations gave satisfactory results in accordance with the experimental values. this hypothesis of quantization of energy and other physical variables is the essence of the quantum theory of matter and radiation. this theory holds well for many problems in physics and theoretical chemistry such as the harmonic oscillator problem and the rigid body rotor. also the application of the quantum theory to the hydrogen atom was very successful in predicting its chemical and physical properties.  the main equation that is used in solving problems in quantum theory is the schroedinger equation. this is a partial differential equation that was formulated based on the finding of wave particle duality of matter by a french physicist who s name is debroglie. the wave particle duality was validated by experimental results using the photoelectric effect and compton effect as well. the wave particle nature of light was also confirmed by similar experiments of diffraction and interference of light. this theory has however some drawbacks and controversial concepts such as the concept of zero point energy.  this concept assumes the existence of finite minimal energy of quantum systems that is not zero in its value. this fact contradicts the natural physical laws of the universe which are based on the postulate that all nonliving systems tend toward maximum thermodynamic stability and minimum states of energy content. this theory however is still credible until nowadays and it gives satisfactory theoretical predictions about physical phenomena commensurate with the experimental values.  the application of this theory in other fields of physics was done for example on fields theory. the formulation quantized theories other than this theory was also successful to particle physics for example. the attempts to formulate quantum theory of gravity is still not achievable due to conflicts between the macroscopic nature of gravitational systems and the microscopic nature of quantum systems. this controversy could not be settled using our current quantum and gravitational theories based on newton and quantum theories. the concept of dark matter is also an ambiguous and controversial concept of astrophysics. this concept is still not validated theoretically and experimentally.  also the recent discovery of the variable nature of the speed of light gives question marks about the validity of einstein theories of relativity. many theories in physics are based in its mathematical formulations on this theory such as the prediction of the existence of black holes. the theory of relativistic quantum theory therefore needs to be modified to account for the variable nature of the speed of light.  also relativistic quantum field theory needs to be modified to account for the same reason. in addition particle physics is dependent in its formulations on the theory of relativity such as string theory and the grand unified theory. concepts of quantum theory therefore have to be applied to other systems very cautiously due to pitfalls that can occur with controversial concepts in theories of physics.
query	INEX_LD-20120112	understand the vietnam war  the vietnam war was a significant conflict in modern u.s. history. while the war began as a civil war between north and south vietnam, it expanded to involve  to varying degrees  china, the u.s., and the u.s.s.r. understanding the war is best done by first getting an overview of the conflict with second hand accounts in historical books, memoirs, and documentaries. then, to dig deeper into the war, you should examine the primary source documents produced during the war, and the artifacts that it left behind. fictitious accounts of the war can also be instructive for helping you understand the spirit of the times.  investigating second hand accounts of the war learning about the war from primary sources understanding the roots of the conflict thinking about civilian reactions take a class about the war. look at fictional accounts of the war. read nonfiction about the war. watch documentaries about the war. read primary sources.primary sources are those that were produced as part of a given historical event or period. visit public history attractions. talk to veterans of the war. talk to civilians who lived through the war. understand the cold war. recognize vietnam s history of colonization. understand the tonkin bay incident. think about the escalation of the war. reflect on the draw down and end of the war. think about the american reaction. reflect on how the vietnamese people felt. identify what was unique in the war. think about the impact of tv.  there are many courses available at universities, community colleges, and online that examine the war either directly or as part of a larger curriculum about modern u.s. history, the cold war, or military history.the war can be understood as part of a program in political science, history, international relations, or a related discipline.   contact your local colleges and universities and express interest in learning more about the vietnam war. alternately, search online for online courses that you could enroll in.    historical fiction is a valuable tool you can use to better understand an event or historical period.even though real people may or may not be involved in historical fiction about the vietnam war, these tales can often explore what it felt like to fight in or endure the war in ways that nonfiction cannot. in the case of the vietnam war, there are numerous novels, plays, and films about the conflict.   some of the most popular films about the war include born on the fourth of july, casualties of war, and full metal jacket. some of the most popular novels about the war include the short timers and matterhorn.    there is a world of nonfiction about the vietnam war. some of these books are memoirs, others are biographies of significant people, and others are more wide ranging histories about the roots, development, and aftermath of the war.   useful biographies could include those of the primary architects or participants of the war, including ho chi minh, lyndon b. johnson, robert mcnamara, and richard nixon. some of the best histories on the vietnam war include america s longest war  the united states and vietnam 1950 1975 by george herring, vietnam  a history by stanley karnow, and we were soldiers once .and young  ia drang the battle that changed the war in vietnam by harold g. moore and joseph l. galloway.there are also countless biographies and memoirs that entirely or partially recount personal experiences of the war. these include memoirs by tobias wolff  in pharaoh s army , william westmoreland  a soldier reports , and philip caputo  a rumor of war .  documentaries are a great way to learn, and there are many documentaries about the vietnam war. for instance, check out last days in vietnam, a 2014 film that examines the close of the vietnam war. another film worth watching is the fog of war. directed by errol morris, the film examines the life and decision making of robert mcnamara, who is considered one of the main architects of the war.  they are the raw materials of history. for instance, you might read the pentagon papers   a collection of documents produced by the u.s. department of defense   to learn what the american government was thinking during the vietnam war. you could also investigate the central intelligence agency s vietnam action histories.   links to these and other sources are available online at http   shsulibraryguides.org c.php g 86715 p 559000. don t neglect photographic sources. the image of kim phuc running down the street after her village was napalmed is one of the most powerful images in modern history. similarly, eddie adams  1968 photo of the summary execution of a suspected communist demonstrates the lawlessness that came to characterize the war.  there are several museums and monuments dedicated to the vietnam war, both in the u.s. and in vietnam. visiting these museums or monuments, especially on a guided tour with a subject expert, can provide greater insight into the war. these museums offer a mixture of artifacts, displays, videos, and placards to explore the war and its effects. you might visit    the national vietnam war museum in texas.the war remnants museum in ho chi minh city. this museum, like the national vietnam war museum in the u.s., has many tanks and vehicles used in the war. the vietnam war memorial, designed by maya lin, in washington, d.c. the monument can improve understanding of the war s meaning. it has the name of every soldier who was killed during the war etched onto it.    prepare a list of questions you want to ask before beginning your conversation. use care when talking to people who survived war, especially veterans.do not assume vets are proud of their service. for many veterans, their military experience was traumatic and remains difficult to talk about. for instance, do not ask,  how many people did you kill   or say  i would have killed many enemy soldiers.  these statements might make veterans uncomfortable or even angry. for similar reasons, do not say to a vet,  i m glad you made it home okay.  even if veterans are physically unharmed, they might feel a great deal of psychic pain and emotional frustration about what they did or saw in vietnam. start with easy questions like,  when did you serve in vietnam   and work your way up through more difficult questions like,  did you see many battles   arrange a meeting with a vietnam vet in your area by contacting vietnam veterans against the war or the wounded warriors project to learn more about the military experience of the war.    during the vietnam war, civilians suffered terribly.their experiences can help you understand how people who lived through the war talked and thought about it. prepare a list of questions you want to ask before beginning your conversation.   find out where the civilian lived during the war. people who lived in north vietnam will likely remember the conflict differently than people who lived in south vietnam. you might want to ask about the attitude toward the war and how it changed over time.    the cold war was the ongoing conflict between the 20th century s two great superpowers, the u.s. and the u.s.s.r. the u.s. was a capitalist democracy, while the u.s.s.r. was a communist dictatorship. the two nations saw each other as mortal enemies. instead of fighting each other directly, though, they fought a series of indirect proxy wars and conflicts around the world in vietnam, nicaragua, cuba, angola, and elsewhere.china was the other emerging superpower, and it officially sided with the u.s.s.r., though the two countries often disagreed. china and the u.s.s.r. both aided north vietnam. ask a grandparent  or parent, if they are old enough to remember  what the cold war was like. ask questions like,  what did americans think of the u.s.s.r.   or  did you know anyone who fought in vietnam      vietnam had a long history of colonization. in the 1800s, france took over indochina  what is today vietnam, laos, and cambodia . during world war ii, they were pushed out by japan, who then instituted an even more brutal colonization regime, resulting in the starvation of around 2 million vietnamese people.france took over again briefly after world war ii ended, but struggled to maintain control, and left in 1954 after their defeat in the battle of dien bien phu.   when france left, the peace treaty divided the country into two parts  north vietnam and south vietnam . elections and reunification were scheduled, but did not occur. in 1959, north vietnam declared war on the south. vietnam s struggle for unity and independence was part of a global struggle against colonial rule. india, algeria, and indonesia all fought anti colonial wars following world war ii. learning about colonization in vietnam will help you understand why the vietnamese were so suspicious and opposed to american intervention in their country.    in 1964, two american battleships reported they had been fired upon by north vietnam. following these alleged attacks, president lyndon johnson sought approval to expand american military presence in vietnam. after this incident, american involvement in vietnam began to increase.later reports revealed that there had been a small conflict between u.s. and north vietnamese forces several days before the incident that president johnson suggested demanded military response. later, it was discovered that american ships had not been fired upon during this incident.    the gulf of tonkin incident caused president johnson to increase the number of u.s. troops in vietnam. by 1967 there were about half a million u.s. troops in the country.one of the major turning points was the tet offensive, a large scale military against u.s. and south vietnamese forces. after the attack, americans increasingly believed that they could not win the war and that new leadership was needed to take america out of vietnam.    as the war dragged on, it became less and less popular.president johnson s high disapproval due to his stance on the war led him to decline seeking re election in 1968. richard nixon was then elected president on a platform that promised to end the war. finally, in 1973, american forces withdrew. north vietnam finally prevailed over south vietnam in 1975, and the country was reunified.    the vietnam war was very unpopular. as more and more u.s. soldiers died, americans began to question the validity of the war. many americans dodged the draft by going to canada or getting married in order to avoid military service in what they considered a pointless conflict. others protested the war by marching and engaging in anti war actions. college campuses were hotbeds of antiwar activity.   many people publicly burned their draft cards in opposition to the war. at kent state university in 1970, army national guardsmen fired on students during an anti war protest. four students died and nine were wounded.try to imagine yourself being shot at by your own country s military simply for exercising your freedom of speech. how would you feel  in order to understand the vietnam war, it is important to consider why it was so unpopular. compare reactions to the vietnam war to reactions to world war ii. how were they different and why     the war was equally unpopular in vietnam. america gave support to the government of south vietnam, but that government was very unpopular. one of the most visible symbols of vietnamese opposition to their own government    and, by extension, their allies and the war   was when thich quang duc burned himself alive in saigon in 1963.  the war was unique in a few ways. it used new kinds of weapons  napalm and agent orange  and was fought against a different kind of enemy.to fully understand the civilian response, it is important to understand these unique aspects.   napalm was a flammable liquid that caused massive burns across anything it touched. during the vietnamese war, it was used extensively by the u.s. to burn forests where enemy soldiers were hiding, but it also caused many civilian deaths. agent orange was a chemical weapon developed by two companies, dow chemical and the monsanto corporation. this chemical caused widespread birth defects, immune deficiency, and an increased rate of cancer for the vietnamese people. it also produced adverse health impacts for u.s. soldiers who were exposed. traditional wars involve two armies facing off on a battlefield. this rarely occurred in vietnam. instead, american soldiers had to contend with guerrillas   soldiers who did not wear uniforms and who would attack small groups of soldiers from a distance, rather than engage them in direct battle. many of these guerillas moved freely between north and south vietnam. guerrillas also used traps and mines to cause damage to american soldiers without confronting them directly.    unlike prior conflicts, americans saw the impact of the vietnam war directly each night on tv. as the war dragged on, support declined as audiences saw firsthand the horrors of the war. understanding the war requires recognizing the impact of tv footage on american attitudes.
query	INEX_LD-20120221	play beginner s electric guitar  learning to play the electric guitar is something that s easy to do, lots of fun, and who knows  if you are talented and practice hard enough, you could definitely become the next six string virtuoso  this article will show you how to get started   playing self taught taking lessons from a professional have your guitar set up properly. listen and repeat. mix up the hard stuff and the easy stuff. avoid stomp boxes when you practice. learn music. find a good guitar teacher. learn to read music. keep it fun. practice.  getting your guitar set up correctly is one of the main keys to having a good learning experience. you can get this done by the guitar guru at the music store, a professional musician, or the owner of your local guitar repair shop. there are a couple primary benefits to having your guitar set up properly    good intonation. this is maybe the most critical thing. your guitar should be accurate so that when it s in tune  and you re playing the right notes , it will sound right. if your guitar has bad intonation, it may be in tune on the lower strings, but terribly out of tune when playing higher notes. this will be discouraging, and make it much harder to learn. ease of playing. a guitar that s set up too high can be nearly impossible to play, as it can take an enormous amount of finger pressure to press down the string onto the frets. not only will this cause intonation problems, it will hurt, and it will slow you down  in time you will develop calluses on your fingers to ease the pain, but it will still be difficult to play fast runs or switch up chords easily.    virtually every song you like has a recognizable melodic pattern, some sort of memorable turn of notes. don t limit yourself to just the guitar solos though that s always good to learn but also listen to the singer, to the bass lines, little fills and noodles from the guitarist. anything that catches your ear will work the simpler, the better, as you are learning.   for example, the melody to locked out of heaven by bruno mars is fairly simple, and has little vocal hooks and phrasings that you can try to imitate with the guitar.  call me maybe from carly rae jepsen has a catchy melody, but it also has a distinctive string backup pattern that would be a good challenge.  gangnam style by psy has an insistent synth line that starts right at the beginning, and runs throughout the song. while you can t get all the  synthy  tone, you can get the basic lick down and then have fun with it  the key here is not to become a guitar legend by learning solos it s to become a guitar legend by learning to listen and be able to play what you hear. if you have trouble catching part of a tune, try watching the youtube video for it  often times, there will be shots of the band playing that bit.    give yourself a  mental  break after working on something difficult by playing something easier, something you re comfortable with. this will keep your fingers moving, keep you improving steadily, and help keep you from getting discouraged.          make sure you always have hard stuff to work on  this is how you will grow as a guitarist. work the things you have a hard time with more frequently than the things you have an easy time accomplishing. for example, if you find you are good at playing fast single note solos, that s great  keep practicing that skill. if you have a hard time with chords, then make sure you practice those at least as much as you practice single note solos.    sure, a stomp box will give you awesome shredding tone, and sustain forever, but it also does something else  it masks errors in technique.   a pure, clean guitar tone will expose every flaw in your playing. save the shred tone for when you re jamming with your friends, or just cutting loose on your own.    as you develop as a guitarist, you will learn to appreciate the  shortcuts  music theory can give you.   for example, instead of having to fiddle around to find the right chords to a song, a knowledge of music theory will enable you to know what the likely chords are in any given key. it will also let you converse musically with other players especially useful if you start a band. for example, a keyboardist will not be able to interpret your finger positions when you say  play this chord.  a keyboard and guitar are not at all alike in how the notes are presented. however, if you say  play an a7 then a b7 then back to e,  he will be likely to understand you.    what makes a good guitar teacher will be different for everybody. some people learn by watching, some learn by hearing. you may want to find somebody who specializes in the kind of music you like, or somebody who just knows how to get the best results no matter what style of music the student prefers. find the best style for your way of learning.   the style of music you like is only one consideration. for example, a guitarist who prefers the blues might take lessons in flamenco style guitar. while flamenco and blues are not at all alike in style or substance, the techniques for flamenco guitar are much more involved, and could result in a guitarist with much more complex blues style.    whatever teaching style you prefer, make sure it includes reading music. because there are six strings involved, and many notes that can be played on different strings, playing guitar by reading music is not easy. training in this skill is very helpful.    no matter what style of music you re learning, taking lessons involves a certain amount of tedium  repetition, difficulties, more repetition, and exercises that are much more about wiggling your fingers the right way than they are about actually sounding interesting. this can lead to burnout if you don t keep it fun           practice the lessons set out for you, and then when you re done, close the book and play what you like, any way that you like. when practicing scales or patterns and you think your mind is going to go numb from boredom, spice up the scales or patterns with embellishments. make sure you work on the actual notes so that you learn the techniques assigned, but also try things like using bends instead of frets for close notes  adding varying degrees of vibrato  turning on the distortion, reverb, and delays  playing the same music backwards. the idea is to do anything to break the routine and keep it interesting.    whether you re learning on your own or taking lessons, the only way you ll get better is by practicing, or  woodshedding.  this means practicing and playing as often as you can, for as long as you can.          learning to play the guitar involves many things  building strength and endurance in your fingers, learning where the notes are on the guitar, building  muscle memory,  playing cleanly, and playing with feeling. these all take time to develop, and some parts will happen faster than others. just keep at it, and you will get the hang of it. every single guitarist you ve ever heard of or listened to on the radio or admired has been exactly where you are. they also have one other thing in common  they never stopped playing and practicing   
query	INEX_LD-20120232	use phrasing for blues guitar  blues phrasing is not just the notes you play, but the timing and rhythm you play them. phrasing is about putting together the notes in a melodic, coherent way, thinking ahead of your playing to figure out riffs and licks that fit into the song. while there is no such thing as  perfect  phrasing, there is plenty to learn to make yourself better.  steps listen to the blues, particularly the singers, to get accustomed to blues phrasing. use silence to your advantage, creating tension and drama. mimic the classic blues phrasing of  call and response  within your solos and riffs. use repeated themes, with slight variations, to tell a story with the music. throw in a little  dovetail phrasing  for sultry, emotional licks in and out of solos. use bends, slides, and vibrato for expressive blues phrasing.  the best way to learn the blues is to listen to them. pay particular attention to the singers, who need to create complex emotions and tones with only a few notes. how do they hold back, create silence, and or rush notes to give the song it s feel and power  do the instrumentalists, particularly guitarists, do anything similar           muddy waters, ma rainy, lightening hopkins, and modern blues players like gary clark jr. are all great places to start listening. the blues began with just guitar and vocals, with singers like robert johnson and blind willie. tapping into this relationship is essential.    well placed silences are the reason guitarists like eric clapton and jimi hendrix are so famous for their speed. they know that the blues is a constant up and down    an emotional rollercoaster that mimics actually feeling the blues. good blues phrasing opens up space with silence, then fills it with a blistering run of notes or a soulful, slow bend. but it is the well timed silence beforehand, not the notes themselves, that show a master of blues phrasing.          when you re first starting out, think of silence as a way to create suspense. get the audience on the edge of their seat, waiting for your next note. almost as good as a silence is a long, powerful note or bend held a long time to build suspense and tension.    the call and response is one of the oldest blues forms, and can be found in many songs. it is when words or a melody are used, then immediately repeated, often with a subtle change or different pitch to make things interesting. the point is to start a conversation between two instruments, singers, or sections of the song.          listen to the king of the blues, b.b, in songs like  how blue can you get.  note how he sings, and the guitar  answers  the call. call and answer works best with another instrument    the guitar and piano, for example, copying and playing off of each other.    a theme is simply 3 5 notes  or more  repeated throughout the song. it often mimics the melody of the singer, or another memorable line from the song. returning to this theme, often adding a new note or changing the tempo or rhythm, is a good way to make a solo feel cohesive but still surprising.          keep a few bars or measures in between your phrases, letting them disappear before they come back.    this gives you the sort of pleading, crying sound essential for blues guitar. a dovetailing note starts out strong, then weakens and fades into silence gracefully. remember that silence is a key part of good blues phrasing    getting in and out of it is essential too.           the blues is all about emotion and expression, and the physicality of the guitar is the best way to show it. bend, shake, manipulate, and slide along the strings to add excitement and personality to your playing. while it is hard to teach, letting yourself relax and get into your playing is really the key to great, personal blues playing.          bends  use your fingers to push the strings around, bending into new notes and holding everyone s attention with soulful string pulling.  vibrato  shake a note back and forth, using all the fingers you can get behind the fret to really move it. this is a subtle, bluesy way to add emphasis to a note.  slides  gets you around the neck in the most bluesy way. spend some time find where you can slide to and still sound good.

master of this art form will tell you that the music has to flow through you in order for you to truly grasp the tango. so start listening  put it on in your car, have it on while you re doing dishes    get to the point where you can tell where it s going. then when you dance, there will be fewer surprises    need some names  di sarli, canaro, pugliese, d arienzo, and laurenz are five names you should definitely check out. throw on youtube    it s all at your fingertips.    this is numero uno when it comes to the tango. the embrace is physically simple, sure, but it must also be sensual, loose but firm, and poised. generally speaking, both parties mirror each other.   partner a  typically the man, though we ll try to be as astereotypical as possible  raises his  or her  left hand and wraps their right arm around their partner, placing their hand on her  or his as the case may be  back, centered slightly below the person s shoulder blades. partner b then raises their right hand to partner a s left and places their left arm around b, with their hand on the center of a s back, as well.    it may have started out in the poorer barrios of argentina, but that doesn t mean that it hasn t evolved since. in order to give tango its proper due, you must dance with the correct posture. that means your head held high, your spine straight, your core strong and chest lifted, and confidence oozing from your body language.   with the wrong posture, not only will you look a little ridiculous, but you also risk injuring your partner. imagine if you re all slumped over, forcing them to arch their back in abnormal ways and to step around your slightly pigeon toed feet like they re walking on eggshells. that s a quick way to get rid of any prospective partners     before you get going with a partner    especially if you re leading    it s important to know the basic step. imagine going into gym class in a mini skirt and high heels  no thank you. you gotta be a little prepared for this kind of thing.   for both parties, remember this  slow, slow, quick, quick, slow. but for the leader, here s your five steps   forward with your left forward with your right forward with left to the right with your right feet together, moving left to meet right. that s it  repeat    for the partner following  you re just mirroring    backward with your right backward with your left backward with your right to the left with your left feet together, moving right to meet left. ta da  repeat       there s obviously more to it than slow, slow, quick, quick, slow, but that s the gist of it. once you have that down and can do it in a counter clockwise circle, grab someone to work with. whether you re leading or following, feel their presence and flow with them. otherwise you re dancing near each other, not with each other.   experiment with different partners. some will naturally be easier to work with than others. certain styles just mesh together better than others. and, of course, if you can find someone who s a bit better than you, learn from them     in american style tango, progressive rocks are where you rock back and forth moving your weight from foot to foot instead of taking a step. so in the basic step we talked about, instead of quick, quick being two steps in one direction, it s one step and then rocking your weight forward. clear as mud, yeah    if you re leading, you re taking a two steps forward on quick, quick. instead, take one step forward, and then throw your weight back onto your back foot  without moving it . if you re following, it s the opposite  step back on quick, and then move your weight forward on the second step.    with progressive rocks and cort s, you can get two moves in one. the cort  is the same as a progressive rock but on the first two steps  slow, slow . to give it more oomph, make sure your strides are long and fluid.    now have you and your partner facing the side    this is called the promenade. instead of thinking forward and back, you re thinking to the left or right. this way you can add in swivels and turns. in most tango forms, the follower  or woman  does most of the dirty work, but men can get in on the action, too    let s say, as partner b, you take two steps to the right  slow, slow . immediately after that second step  and before the third , throw your torso to face the left. then you resume moving backward. swivel check  for turns, the leader turns toward his partner 180 degrees on the first quick step and the one following steps between his feet. now we re getting fancy     it would seem like leading is easier    being able to read someone s mind is no easy feat    but leading has its own perils, too. you always have to plan a step ahead and know where you want the dance to take you. so while you re working your way around the circle, think 8 steps into the future.    you get to have the peace of mind that you just have to go with the flow. but going with the flow can be a little disconcerting if you don t trust. the easiest way to know that you re capable of depending on your partner is to feel their weight. feel where it s going. feel where it is between the moves. balance with them. it ll take you with it.    you can do all the fancy moves you want, but if you and your partner don t have that synchronicity, that gel, that essence is the tango, it doesn t matter. don t feel pressured to spice it up. stick to what you feel. keep it simple, master the simple, and the rest will come.   have you ever seen an old couple that just walks a simple dance together  how moving it is because you can see how they just get it  that. that is what you re aiming for.    the teacher should be able to dance both lead and follow so he she can teach you both how to do it and how it feels for your partner. try to find a class that has a dozen or so people so you have a few partners to work with but still can seek individual attention.   there are three types of tango  argentine tango, international ballroom tango, and the american ballroom tango. argentine tango has become quite popular because of its free form, ad lib steps and greater focus on the woman. many amateur groups exist to teach and promote it.    whether you re in class or at a party, the tango generally happens in a circle. there are a couple things to know    it moves counter clockwise. you don t have to worry about turns, swivels, or anything fancy    just know that you re moving counter clockwise. generally speaking, the better tango ers take larger steps and dominate more space. the less confident dances end up getting relegated to the center of the circle, all smushed in by the more audacious dancers. don t let this happen to you     if you go alone, find a partner to have a  cabeceo  with. however, you don t ask  you simply make eye contact. if you meet eyes, you smile or nod. if they don t meet your gaze, move on. it s less intrusive and doesn t leave one party pressured to say yes.   generally, a round, or  tanda,  is 4 dances. so if you re not sure you want to dance with this person for 4 dances, ask them on the 2nd or 3rd     the tango requires balance and the willingness to learn. at first there will be a heck of a learning curve, but trust that it will go away. the steps will come. you ll step on a few toes, but they ll heal. if you keep with it, you ll only get better.   the tango is not a dance that can be learned in one evening or with one lesson. that is what makes the tango so much fun  there is so much to learn    it can take you your whole lifetime to learn and understand the tango. but don t let that discourage you  let it intrigue you. when you ve mastered it, you ve mastered an art.

traditional dancing that includes rumba, cha cha, tango, waltz, and fox trot, to name a few.   1    these dances come from several parts of the world and from different eras, but the thing they have in common is that they are formal partner dances that are focused on flow and elegance. the good news is that learning ballroom dances may be easier than you expect but you will have a lot of enjoyable work ahead of you.  choosing a style of ballroom dance learning how to ballroom dance survey all the different styles of dance that are considered ballroom dance. decide what your dancing

foxtrot, viennese waltz, and quickstep. latin styles include cha cha, rumba, samba, paso doble, and jive.while these styles may vary a bit, especially between american and international styles, the foundation of each is a very specific and distinct sequence of steps. complicated dances such as the bolero and paso doble can be picked up later, but if you want to go out dancing and not be stuck in a chair the whole night, you ll need to learn the basic steps such as the rumba, cha cha, tango, waltz, and fox trot.    do you want to do social dancing or do you want to compete  do you want to go out each weekend or do you just need to look good at a wedding  a specific type of event might require that you learn only one style. you ll be better prepared for a night of casual social dancing if

more of the schools and talk to them about your goals and if they can help you fulfill them.   know what you want and that your needs match your instructors  expertise and methods. talking to the other students and seeing how long they ve been at the studio or visiting one or more dance classes may give you a good idea if it is a match. some schools, for example, specialize in competitive dancing, while others focus on helping first time dancers gain the experience  and courage   to brave the ballroom dance floor at their next wedding invitation. if you live near a college campus, take a look at their student clubs and activities. many have ballroom dance classes that are open to non student members.    if you are nervous going to your first class with absolutely no knowledge of ballroom dancing, you may want to practice a bit with the help of websites or videos online. start by learning the box step, the foundation step of many ballroom dances.   when doing the box step you are moving your feet in a square. start with your feet together with your weight on your right foot. move your left leg straight forward in a small step and shift your weight onto that foot. next step your right foot up but to the side of your left foot, so that there is a gap of about a foot between your feet. finish this first sequence by shifting your weight onto your right foot and bringing your feet together by moving your left foot over to meet your right. now you will do this sequence again, only backwards. shift your weight to your left foot and move your right foot straight back in a small step. shift your weight and move your left foot back but to the side. finish the box step by moving your right foot over to meet your left. if you are having trouble, remember that it is always the outside leg that moves around the square you are making.  there are many articles on the internet that can give you the basic sequence of steps and body movements of other ballroom steps including  how to do the rumba, how to do the cha cha, how to samba, how to dance the tango, and how to dance the waltz.   these videos and online content cannot necessarily replace the benefits of going to a class. a dance teacher will be able to give you individualized instruction that is key to improving your dance skills.    while you may have some basic knowledge of ballroom dance steps, classes will help you with all the other important aspects that make up a dance, including posture, communication, and dance etiquette. some classes require that you come with a partner but many are designed for people without a specific partner.   be sure to check the prices, as they will vary. you will want to be sure the school and your teacher are worth what you re paying. many dance studios will offer potential students a free or low cost initial lesson that will allow you to more easily find a good match between the studio and your goals. group classes will generally be less expensive than private lessons, while the best specialized and personalized coaching for competitive ballroom dance can be a hundred times more expensive.  ask your teacher for a list of songs in the rhythm you re working on. buy them and listen to them in the background. you might also find some musical collections selected specifically for a particular dance.   pick out the dance rhythm and count it aloud as the music plays. many beginning dancers benefit from first clapping the beat with the music. yet also as you listen, visualize the dancers moving to the music. feel the style of the dance, in addition to its rhythm.    most studios have practice sessions outside of lessons but you can also just practice on your own. don t be afraid to ask more experienced dancers for help.    perhaps you have a friend that would like to learn how to ballroom dance as well. maybe you can convince your partner to join you in the adventure of learning to dance.   it is a fact of life that people come in all shapes and sizes. adjust your position and your dancing style to accommodate your partner, especially if height differences or body size might otherwise cause uncomfortable body contact. remember that ballroom dancing is about grace, polish and courtesy. dance at the level of your partner. don t try to do all your advanced new moves with someone who s just starting out. ballroom dancing should be enjoyable for everyone involved. there is no point in trying to make yourself look good by making your partner look bad. when a couple works together, dance is a thing of beauty. the secret to dancing together, as opposed to dancing near one another, is communication. this communication isn t conveyed through some special code, but is rather accomplished through the subtle body movements that can easily be detected when both dancers are standing upright, with good posture.    you re in this to learn how to dance, so go dancing. even after your first lesson feel free to go out dancing in public. if you have learned two moves at that lesson just use those. that s enough to go dancing and have a great time on the dance floor.   ask everyone to dance  beginners and experienced dancers will both help you to improve your dancing. beginners make you check what you know. experienced dancers will correct you. as a rule, ballroom dancers don t say no when you ask them to dance. if someone asks you to dance, say yes  remember that not only is it rude to say no, you also shouldn t miss out on a chance to polish your skills, no matter who asks. remember that ballroom etiquette precludes dancing more than two dances in a row with the same person. if you only want to dance with your boyfriend or girlfriend, you can stay home and dance in your living room.

query	INEX_LD-2012303	recognize and prevent valley fever  coccidioidomycosis   valley fever is a non communicable fungal disease originating from the  coccidioides  species. the organisms live in the soil of semi arid areas, such as the southwestern united states, regions of mexico, and south america. when its spores are released into the air, they can cause lung infections, from slight to severe. if you ve been or are going to an area affected by valley fever, be sure you understand the prevention measures you can take to avoid contracting the disease and the symptoms that can help you diagnose an infection.   1     recognizing the symptoms assessing your risk preventing infection treating the disease watch our for flu like symptoms. be on the lookout for more severe infections. be wary of lung infections. find out if you ve been in an endemic area. assess your exposure to infected soils. check if you re part of a high risk group. find out if you ve had previous exposure to valley fever. check for common diseases or outbreaks. avoid dusty areas in regions where the infection is indigenous. avoid work and work areas where the soil is disturbed. implement an air filtration system. stay inside during storms. use an n95 respirator. clean any injuries thoroughly. take a sick day. go to the doctor. get a prescription for antifungal medication.  mild infections of valley fever often go unrecognized because they manifest themselves much like other common and seasonal illnesses. however, if you have been in an endemic area, you should pay attention to any early symptoms in order to avoid contracting a more serious form of the disease.   the earliest symptoms of valley fever include fever, headaches, a persistent cough, chest pain and shortness of breath, chills, night sweats, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and red bumpy rashes, especially on the upper body or legs.    if your valley fever goes untreated, the symptoms can become more severe, and the infection can cause chronic pneumonia. if you have been experiencing a constant fever, persistent chest pains and coughing, and weight loss, you should go to the doctor immediately.another telling symptom of a developing infection is coughing up mucus tinged with blood, which may indicate that you have nodules in your lungs.    in its most dangerous and advanced stages, valley fever can spread from the lungs to other parts of the body, including the skin, bones, liver, brain, heart, and nervous system. at this point, you should already be in contact with your doctor, who can help you navigate these more severe symptoms.in its most serious  disseminated  form, valley fever will lead to skin sores, lesions in the skull and spine, bone and joint infections, and meningitis  an infection that affects the fluid and membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord.    the fungus that causes valley fever can be found in the soils of the southwestern united states. it s also present in some regions of mexico, central america, and south america.in the u.s., affected states include arizona, southern california, southern nevada, new mexico, western texas, southwestern utah, and south central washington. most of the 10,000 annual cases are diagnosed in arizona and california.    you contract valley fever by inhaling microscopic fungal spores that are released into the air when soil is disturbed. if you are in an endemic area and have been exposed to dusty conditions caused by heat mixed with wind and or manmade disturbances to the soil, you are at a greater risk of being infected.   construction work, agricultural labor, military field training, and archaeological exploration are examples of activities that can put you at risk of contracting valley fever.  not everyone who is exposed to the coccidioides fungus will contract valley fever. the fungal spores can cause infections in people of any age or race, but there are certain groups of people who are more prone to infections.most cases of valley fever occur in adults who are over 60. so, elderly people are at greater risk of infection. anyone who has a weakened immune system is at greater risk of contracting the disease and developing more severe forms of it. these people include those who have hiv aids, diabetes, and other chronic illnesses  expectant mothers, especially in their third trimester  and people who have had an organ transplant. people of african and or filipino descent are more susceptible to valley fever.    the symptoms are often subtle or flu like, which means that many people never even realize they ve had it. however, if you have already had it, you will be immune to the disease for life.if you have been tested for valley fever previously, it will show up on your medical record. if you have not been tested, you can ask your doctor for a skin test to see if you test positive for coccidioides. if you do but have never had valley fever, it is likely that you are immune to it. keep in mind that 30 60  of people living in affected areas will test positive for coccidiodes, but only about 40  of the infected population will ever present symptoms.  if you are planning to travel, it might be a good idea to check up on the common diseases and outbreaks in the region you are visiting. visit the cdc s website to determine if valley fever is something to worry about while you are traveling.  these include areas in the affected states which receive very little rainfall, particularly arizona and california.    infections occur when people inhale spores that become airborne after disturbing contaminated soil. if you re in a high risk area, stay away from work zones that involve construction, excavation, and agriculture.this also includes domestic labor. if you re living in an endemic region, you should consult a doctor before doing significant yardwork, gardening, construction projects, or other sorts of digging in your yard or on your property. if you cannot avoid working in contaminated soil, go to the doctor immediately to get their prevention recommendations. it s likely that they ll encourage you to wear a special mask and or take a preventative antifungal medication to reduce your risk of infection.    if you live in an affected area, consider keeping your windows closed and using an air filter to ensure that the dust and dirt outside your door doesn t invade your living space.  winds will kick up dust that contains the pesky fungal spores, so be sure that you find shelter that has closed windows.    wear this or a miner s mask in areas that have recently suffered a natural disaster. natural disasters, such as earthquakes and dust storms, can also disturb contaminated soil. this can cause the spores to become airborne. use a respirator to avoid breathing in these spores.normal paper masks or bandanas will not offer protection against coccidioides since the spores are microscopic. in order to be effective, you need a respirator that will completely seal around your face and prevent particles 2 4 micrometers in size from passing through.  use soap and water to clean any wounds that may have been exposed to dirt or dust. this can help stop an infection from developing.  for most valley fever infections, getting plenty of rest and drinking plenty of fluids will restore you to health. if you only have mild flu like symptoms, a simple, at home cure will usually suffice.  if you re worried that you may have valley fever, it s a good idea to make an appointment with a medical professional. they will be able to monitor the disease and ensure that your case doesn t worsen or advance into a disseminated form. make sure to provide a thorough history of your travels and activities so your doctor can include a comprehensive list of possible infections and appropriate treatment monitoring.   seeing the doctor will be beneficial to public health, helping researchers to track the scope and severity of the disease. it will also inform you as to whether or not you have valley fever and can expect to be immune to it in the future.    if your symptoms worsen or don t improve upon a few day s bed rest, go to the doctor immediately. they can help address the infection by giving you a prescription for antifungal drugs that can attack the root of the disease.because these drugs have unpleasant side effects like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, doctors will only generally prescribe them for serious or chronic cases.

vietnam war, there are numerous novels, plays, and films about the conflict.   some of the most popular films about the war include born on the fourth of july, casualties of war, and full metal jacket. some of the most popular novels about the war include the short timers and matterhorn.    there is a world of nonfiction about the vietnam war. some of these books are memoirs, others are

prepare a list of questions you want to ask before beginning your conversation. use care when talking to people who survived war, especially veterans.do not assume vets are proud of their service. for many veterans, their military experience was traumatic and remains difficult to talk about. for instance, do not ask,  how many people did you kill   or say  i would have killed many enemy soldiers.  these statements might make veterans uncomfortable or even angry. for similar reasons, do not say to a vet,  i m glad you made it home okay.  even if veterans are physically unharmed, they might feel a great deal of psychic pain and emotional frustration about what they did or saw in vietnam. start with easy questions like,  when did you serve in vietnam   and work your way up through more difficult questions like,  did you see many battles   arrange a meeting with a vietnam vet in your area by contacting vietnam veterans against the war or the wounded warriors project to learn more about the military experience of the war.    during the vietnam war, civilians suffered terribly.their experiences can help you understand how people who lived through the war talked and thought about it. prepare a list of questions you want to ask before beginning your conversation.   find out where the civilian lived during the war. people who lived in north vietnam will likely remember the conflict differently than people who lived in south vietnam. you might want to ask about the attitude toward the war and how it changed over time.    the cold war was the ongoing conflict between the 20th century s two great superpowers, the u.s. and the u.s.s.r. the u.s. was a capitalist democracy, while the u.s.s.r. was a communist dictatorship. the two nations saw each other as mortal enemies. instead of fighting each other directly, though, they fought a series of indirect proxy wars and conflicts around the world in vietnam, nicaragua, cuba, angola, and elsewhere.china was the other emerging superpower, and it officially sided with the u.s.s.r., though the two countries often disagreed. china and the u.s.s.r. both aided north vietnam. ask a grandparent  or parent, if they are old enough to remember  what the cold war was like. ask questions like,  what did americans think of the u.s.s.r.   or  did you know anyone who fought in vietnam      vietnam had a long history of colonization. in the 1800s, france took over indochina  what is today vietnam, laos, and cambodia . during world war ii, they were pushed out by japan, who then instituted an even more brutal colonization regime, resulting in the starvation of around 2 million vietnamese people.france took over again briefly after world war ii ended, but struggled to maintain control, and left in 1954 after their defeat in the battle of dien bien phu.   when france left, the peace treaty divided the country into two parts  north vietnam and south vietnam . elections and reunification were scheduled, but did not occur. in 1959, north vietnam declared war on the south. vietnam s struggle for unity and independence was part of a global struggle against colonial rule. india, algeria, and indonesia all fought anti colonial wars following world war ii. learning about colonization in vietnam will help you understand why the vietnamese were so suspicious and opposed to american intervention in their country.    in 1964, two american battleships reported they had been fired upon by north vietnam. following these alleged attacks, president lyndon johnson sought approval to expand american military presence in vietnam. after this incident, american involvement in vietnam began to increase.later reports revealed that there had been a small conflict between u.s. and north vietnamese forces several days before the incident that president johnson suggested demanded military response. later, it was discovered that american ships had not been fired upon during this incident.    the gulf of tonkin incident caused president johnson to increase the number of u.s. troops in vietnam. by 1967 there were about half a million u.s. troops in the country.one of the major turning points was the tet offensive, a large scale military against u.s. and south vietnamese forces. after the attack, americans increasingly believed that they could not win the war and that new leadership was needed to take america out of vietnam.    as the war dragged on, it became less and less popular.president johnson s high disapproval due to his stance on the war led him to decline seeking re election in 1968. richard nixon was then elected president on a platform that promised to end the war. finally, in 1973, american forces withdrew. north vietnam finally prevailed over south vietnam in 1975, and the country was reunified.    the vietnam war was very unpopular. as more and more u.s. soldiers died, americans began to question the validity of the war. many americans dodged the draft by going to canada or getting married in order to avoid military service in what they considered a pointless conflict. others protested the war by marching and engaging in anti war actions. college campuses were hotbeds of antiwar activity.   many people publicly burned their draft cards in opposition to the war. at kent state university in 1970, army national guardsmen fired on students during an anti war protest. four students died and nine were wounded.try to imagine yourself being shot at by your own country s military simply for exercising your freedom of speech. how would you feel  in order to understand the vietnam war, it is important to consider why it was so unpopular. compare reactions to the vietnam war to reactions to world war ii. how were they different and why     the war was equally unpopular in vietnam. america gave support to the government of south vietnam, but that government was very unpopular. one of the most visible symbols of vietnamese opposition to their own government    and, by extension, their allies and the war   was when thich quang duc burned himself alive in saigon in 1963.  the war was unique in a few ways. it used new kinds of weapons  napalm and agent orange  and was fought against a different kind of enemy.to fully understand the civilian response, it is important to understand these unique aspects.   napalm was a flammable liquid that caused massive burns across anything it touched. during the vietnamese war, it was used extensively by the u.s. to burn forests where enemy soldiers were hiding, but it also caused many civilian deaths. agent orange was a chemical weapon developed by two companies, dow chemical and the monsanto corporation. this chemical caused widespread birth defects, immune deficiency, and an increased rate of cancer for the vietnamese people. it also produced adverse health impacts for u.s. soldiers who were exposed. traditional wars involve two armies facing off on a battlefield. this rarely occurred in vietnam. instead, american soldiers had to contend with guerrillas   soldiers who did not wear uniforms and who would attack small groups of soldiers from a distance, rather than engage them in direct battle. many of these guerillas moved freely between north and south vietnam. guerrillas also used traps and mines to cause damage to american soldiers without confronting them directly.    unlike prior conflicts, americans saw the impact of the vietnam war directly each night on tv. as the war dragged on, support declined as audiences saw firsthand the horrors of the war. understanding the war requires recognizing the impact of tv footage on american attitudes.

query	INEX_LD-2012325	follow a pour over will  a pour over will typically accompanies a revocable living trust. while most assets normally are transferred into the trust before the person s death, a pour over will acts as a failsafe by directing that any assets not already transferred into the trust should be  poured over  into the trust after the person s death. to follow a pour over will, you still must go through probate, but these procedures typically are abbreviated formalities. then any assets are transferred to the trust for distribution to the beneficiaries named in the trust instrument.   1     handling summary probate transferring assets closing the estate file the will with the probate court. have an executor appointed. complete an inventory of the probate estate. file a motion for summary administration. meet with the successor trustee. identify assets not included in the trust. transfer deeds or titles to the trust. notify the deceased person s creditors. review claims. pay debts and taxes. distribute the remaining trust property.  to initiate proceedings, you must file the pour over will, typically along with any other estate planning documents, with the clerk of the probate court in the county where the deceased person was a resident.the clerk will have forms you must fill out to formally file the will and petition the court to enter it into probate. you typically must pay a filing fee to file the will and any supporting documents, as well as have the probate petition served on major beneficiaries. in the case of a pour over will, this typically would mean you must have the probate petition served on the successor trustee.    even if the pour over will names an executor, that person must be officially appointed by a probate judge and given certificates that establish that person s authority to act on behalf of the estate.in some situations, particularly if the pour over will itself and the other documents you ve filed are simple and straightforward, the probate judge may not even order a hearing. however, if you are appointed executor you still typically must make another trip to the courthouse to be sworn in as a fiduciary and pick up your certificates.    the appointed executor or personal representative must make an inventory of the deceased person s assets not already transferred to their living trust.the probate court has a form you can use to inventory the property in the estate. you may want to make additional copies of this form so you can file a clean copy with the court that you ve typed or completed in ink. typically there will be very little property involved, mostly small items of personal property. in most cases you can just provide a ballpark estimate of the value of these items   you aren t expected to get an appraisal of usual personal items like household furniture or clothing. if the deceased person owned personal property of significant value that wasn t transferred to the trust prior to death, such as jewelry or artwork, these items may need to be appraised by a licensed professional appraiser. when you ve filed out the inventory form, take the original along with at least two copies to the probate clerk s office. the original will be filed  the copies are for the estate s records and the successor trustee.    given that most of the deceased person s assets likely were already held by the estate prior to their death, the pour over will typically qualifies for a quicker and more simplified probate process.the probate court should have a form that you can fill out to request summary administration. ask the probate clerk or check the probate court s website. keep in mind you typically will have to pay a filing fee to file this motion, and you may have to have it served on major beneficiaries   for a pour over will, this would typically be the successor trustee. any filing fees or other court costs should be paid out of the estate, not out of your own pocket. virginia and delaware don t have summary administration proceedings, but all other states do. each state has its own eligibility requirements for summary administration, so check those before you file your motion and make sure the estate qualifies. the major eligibility requirement concerns the value of the property in the estate. estates worth more than a certain amount are not eligible for summary administration, although this value varies significantly among states. for example, an estate must be worth less than  30,000 to qualify for summary administration in new york. however, nevada sets that ceiling at  200,000.    if you are the executor or personal representative of the estate, you ll need to get together with the successor trustee and review the trust instrument to determine how to transfer any property covered by the pour over will.during the first few months after the person s death, the successor trustee and the executor   assuming they aren t the same person   must keep in close contact with each other and report regularly on actions made on behalf of the estate. if there are several significant pieces of personal property or real estate that need to be transferred to the trust, it can be helpful to make a list or spreadsheet so you can note the requirements for transfer of ownership. if you are serving as executor, offer to assist the successor trustee in notifying the beneficiaries or gathering property to transfer into the trust.    using the inventory filed with the court, find the assets and the ownership documents that will need to be amended to transfer ownership of those assets to the trust.for items of significant value that don t have a title or other legally recognized ownership document, the executor may need to prepare a basic assignment or bill of sale document that transfers all rights in that property to the trust. if you need to transfer real property deeds, go to the county clerk or recorder in the county where the property is located. the deed will be recorded there.    deeds for real property and titles for certain personal property such as cars or boats must be transferred to the trust using whatever transfer requirements and formalities are established by state and local law.the law that applies typically is the law of the state or county where the property is located, if in a different state or county than the deceased person s primary residence. depending on the type of asset, you may not be able to transfer title to the trust s name without some difficulty. for example, if your state requires all cars to have auto insurance, you may have a hard time finding an insurer who will write a policy for a car owned by a trust rather than an individual person, because there s no way to check a driving record. in those situations, the successor trustee and the executor should get together with an experienced probate attorney and discuss their options. it may be possible to simply transfer ownership of the car directly to the beneficiary. to transfer ownership of real property, the executor typically must create a new quitclaim deed, sign it under the witness and notary formalities required by the state where the property is located, and record it with the county clerk.    after all property has been transferred to the trust, the successor trustee is responsible for gathering the financial records of the deceased person and notifying their creditors of the death.in addition to creditors, the successor trustee also will be responsible for notifying social security and the state department of health of the death. even though you re not using probate court, the court may have a notice form that you can use as a guide to draft your own. make sure you don t use the probate court s form itself, as it will direct creditors to file their claims with the court. you also may be able to find creditor notice forms through various legal forms providers online. make sure the form you use meets your state s legal requirements. include a firm deadline on your notice   you might want to check the probate court s rules regarding how long a creditor has to file a claim and use that as a guide. otherwise, creditors can file a claim against the trust whenever they want, and you ll have a hard time determining when assets can be distributed to the beneficiaries.    in response to the notice, the deceased person s creditors will submit claims to the trustee that state the type of debt and the amount of money the deceased person owed them. these claims typically include some sort of proof of the validity of the debt.if no proof of the validity of the debt is included with the creditor s claim, you have the right as the successor trustee to demand it. if the validity isn t proven, you can legally dispute the validity of the debt and refuse to pay it. keep in mind that unlike probate proceedings, if you are closing an estate through a living trust you don t have the benefit of a statute of limitations on claims. this often can make it more difficult to wind up an estate unless you have a firm grasp on the deceased person s debts and can easily get in contact with their creditors.    the successor trustee is responsible for paying off all of the deceased person s debts and filing that person s final income tax returns as well as any estate taxes that may be owed.if it hasn t already been done, the successor trustee must get an employer identification number  ein  for the trust and set up a trust bank account to handle payments as well as monetary distributions to beneficiaries. you can get an ein using the electronic application system on the irs s website. it s free and you ll receive the trust s ein immediately. the trust s ein should be used to open a bank account for the trust and to file trust taxes. when you file the deceased person s final income tax return, however, you should use their social security number   not the trust s ein. if assets in the trust generate  600 or more in income, you must file an income tax return for the estate as well. if there are not enough monetary assets in the trust to cover the deceased person s debts, as successor trustee you ll have to arrange an estate sale to sell estate assets to cover those debts. unlike wills filed in probate, you don t need any court approval to sell any estate assets including real property.    once the successor trustee is satisfied that all debts and taxes have been paid and there are no outstanding claims, they will distribute the property still held in the trust to the trust beneficiaries according to the terms of the trust instrument.if any of the trust s beneficiaries are children under the age of 18, the trust instrument typically will state how those assets are to be handled. in most cases, they are held in trust until the child reaches a certain age   usually 18 or 21. for titled personal property or deeded real property, the ownership documents must be transferred using the transfer of ownership rules and requirements of the state and county in which the property is located.

follow these guidelines.  steps learn the different kinds of football wagers. familiarize yourself with key statistics in football betting. keep up to date on emerging trends. manage your bankroll properly.  football gamblers have a wide array of bets to choose from, ranging from straight wagers to proposition bets. all can play a role in the player s betting arsenal.   spread  this is the most common football bet. a team may appear on a sports book s betting board as  101 new england  3.  this means that a player who places a bet on new england  by calling 101 to the teller  can only win if new england beats its opponent by 4 points or more. if new england wins by 3 points, the result is declared  no action  and all money is returned. if new england wins by 2 points or less or loses the game outright, the bet is a losing one. spread bets are generally 11 10, or  11 wagers to make  10. so a winning bet returns  21. money line  this is a straight wager on who will win the game. teams that are favored require a larger bet to make a smaller profit. for example, if san diego is favored in its game with kansas city, its money line may be  san diego  160.  that means the player must bet  160 to win  100.  kansas city  260  means that the bettor collects  260 on a  100 wager if the chiefs win. over under  this is a bet on whether the combined score of a game will exceed a predetermined figure or not. a bettor choosing the over in a game with an over under of 45 wins the bet if the 2 teams combine to score 46 points or more. payouts are the same as with point spread wagers. parlays and teasers  these wagers involve 2 or more teams. all bets must be winners for the player to collect. the greater the number of bets, the larger the payout. a winning 5 team parlay, for example, pays 20 1. teasers also involve multiple teams but allow you to alter the betting line slightly in your favor. propositions  these exotic bets usually are offered only during special games, like the super bowl. players can make bets on virtually any game occurrence. some prop bets can be on the type of play that results in a score, whether a quarterback will throw an interception, the score at the end of the first half, or even who will win the opening coin toss. these wagers are difficult to win and offered at generous odds.    there are thousands of football websites providing detailed information on every phase of the game. while most fans concentrate on touchdowns, rushing yards and completion percentages, serious bettors focus on other data that historically has a greater impact on the outcome of games.   average yards per attempt  many professional sports bettors use this figure to determine the effectiveness of a team s skill players, but it also points to the overall performance of the offensive unit. bettors generally prefer quarterbacks who average 8 yards  7.3 m  per passing attempt and rushers who average at least 4 yards  3.7 m  per carry. first half scoring trends  football bettors try to isolate teams that build early leads and take control of the game. these teams tend to manage the clock well in the second half and force their opponent to take chances to close the gap, often resulting in turnovers. negative pass play percentage  this is the combination of 2 important defensive statistics   sacks and interceptions   that often uncover teams sitting on a victory. teams with an nppp higher than the league average have disruptive defenses that take opponents out of their game plan. turnover ratio  few statistics have a greater influence on the outcome of a game than turnovers. teams that don t protect the football lose field position and very often, games.    effective sports bettors consider a variety of factors before making their wagers. professional sports gamblers are keenly aware of personnel changes, the extent of player injuries, and even weather forecasts.    professional football bettors are dispassionate gamblers. they understand the innate volatility of the game and therefore, never risk a large portion of their bankroll on any single contest. professionals try to grind out profits over the long haul, capitalizing on their experience and insights into each contest. in general, bettors will only risk 20 percent of their total bankroll each week. for example    a player has a starting bankroll of  5,000. he can make  1,000 in bets for that week. if the bettor wins  2,500, increasing his bankroll to  7,500, he can make  1,500 in wagers the following week. professional bettors also vary the size of wagers on games based on the strength of their opinions. if the player wants to bet  1,000 on 3 games, he may put 4 units on the bet he is surest about and 3 units on the other 2 games. in this example, each unit represents  100.

query	INEX_XER-108	draw a map of the usa  drawing a map of the united states of america is harder than it looks. while you see states that are basically rectangles like colorado and wyoming, you can t forget states such as maryland and west virginia.  steps learn about certain projections and maps. understand the four different maps. comprehend famous landmarks. identify the projection you are going to use to draw your map. think about size. recognize the shapes of all 50 states. attempt a rough sketch of the outline of the country and the states. slowly go into more detail. draw your final using a pencil.  all projections will have some degree of distortion.   the mercator projection is a mathematical projection that stretches out area to an infinite factor at the poles. while this projection displays areas near the equator accurately, there is an extreme amount of distortion near the poles. it is recommended to draw from this projection as the united states sits below the 50 n latitude where distortion gets really high. the winkel triple projection is a compromise projection designed to view the entire world with minimal distortion. this is not a good projection to draw from as the longitude of the usa is too far from the prime meridian to have an accurate drawing. the albers conic equal area projection is a projection designed to conserve land area and shape. this is one of the best maps to draw from as it gives an accurate shape of the united states, and is most familiar with the general public. just remember that the grid lines are not perfectly horizontal or vertical.    the four are political, physical, thematic, and cartograms. for now, you do not have to worry about cartograms.   political maps will include   borders names of cities and capitals and

  sometimes, a legend, or key, is used. landmarks   thematic maps will be different. instead of the usual thing, thematic maps depend on special characteristics, such as vegetation, oil consumption, urban density, climate differences, etc. a legend is going to be needed, as the map will almost certainly be colored to differentiate different areas.    an example is the highest mountain in that state.    maps of the united states on the internet is a fine source, instead of having to buy it.    the more you zoom into the usa, the more details you will have to fill in. this is very important for drawing the usa as a whole, because even a minor blemish or streak here and there can significantly impact shape.    while some states are literally just rectangles  e.g. wyoming and colorado , you can t forget states such as maryland and west virginia. thus, it would be reasonable to practice tracing some of these states first, then put on the main map. a table of land area and a map of the state is useful.    you don t have to fill in every necessary detail, but just a generalization of what the state will look like. this would be better than to start blindly, than to have a generalization. since starting at the nooks and crannies right away usually would distort most maps, it is not recommended to start along that route.    this does not mean that you draw the usa over and over again. it also does not mean to erase it over and over again and draw it. rather, divide the places you are having trouble with and analyze the detail. some examples are coastlines and rivers. although not needed, it may be helpful to take notes about what goes here and there and such.   when you draw thematic maps, do not draw any artificial islands, oil rigs locations, or similar things, unless it is specified in your legend. unnecessary information can confuse the reader, even in maps   not just books. it is good if you plot or find out routes of major rivers that impact on state shapes. some examples are the mississippi, missouri, colorado and the two red rivers  oklahoma texas and north dakota minnesota . since rivers impact shapes of the usa, especially in the eastern region, it significantly helps improve shape and reduces distortion. remember about alaska and hawaii. although technically not in the lower 48, they are still part of the usa, and thus needs to be included in your map. many versions of maps made by computers have alaska and hawaii at the lower left corner of the paper, where mexico shares its border with the usa. you may also wish to put them on a separate sheet of paper.    a regular  2 pencil is fine, but serious sketchers may use a sketchers kit with 10 different pencils of all shades. this should include the following    color   very important for drawing maps of all kinds. on a political map, it is wise to choose colors that contrast with each other, and to not color in two bordering states with one color. that way, it will reduce confusion. all features of the physical map   explained above. only do this if you are drawing a physical map.  it is possible to color in a hybrid of political and physical. colored pencils prevail over other methods of coloring as the map will be crowded. this will require borders, cities and capitals, and physical features. color from the physical, not political map, will be used.   thematic map  the data of your choice with a legend and color accordingly. even though you will have to research on the internet or find out data from books, it is still a brilliant achievement to have drawn the usa, instead of copying and pasting. a marker  dark colors preferred    this is to clarify borders and to make it stand out. without the marker, contrast would be low.

query	INEX_XER-117	jam  jamming is spontaneous musical collaboration. instead of playing a song, jamming is when musicians find a groove or melody and improvise together. while jamming the group has the freedom to try new things, play around with potential songs, and have fun finding a musical connection with each other. jamming is a great way to play music casually, to warm up with your band, or to experiment with new keys and melodies for future songs.  starting a jam session learning to jam round up a small group of musicians. discuss the chord structure or key of the song. play through the melody of the song 1 2 times so that everyone feels comfortable. keep your head up as you play. feel the vibe of the song as it grows. improvise on the song when it s your turn. share the spotlight. decide as a group when to end the song. jam along to your favorite songs at home. learn the  standards  in your genre. know your instrument. learn a few common chord structures. learn music theory.  you only need one other musician to jam with, but it is usually best to have at least one rhythm player  drums or percussion  and 1 2 other melody instruments  guitars, bass . while there is no law saying that you can t jam with 15 other people, jam groups generally stay smaller so that every musician can listen in and play off of every other musician. a small group of 3 4 similarly skilled musicians is a good place to start.   that said, there are many long standing groups, such as blues bands, drum groups, and bluegrass bands, that have enormous, open jams, inviting a wide variety of skills and styles. jamming is non judgmental and free form, so just have fun. if you re just starting to improvise, jumping into a large jam session is a great way to get your feet wet without a ton of pressure, as any mistakes you make are less likely to get noticed.    think of this as the guiding principle of the song. while there will likely be some improvisation and exploration, everyone needs to understand the chords in order to stay together. in general, most jams stick to simple, 3 4 chord songs or melodies that everyone already knows. the point of a jam is not to show off complex, interlocked instrumentals, but to allow each musician the freedom to experiment.   jams can either play established songs, such as the blues jam classic  stormy monday,  or quickly improvised chord groupings. if you re confused, let someone pick a song and the chords and go from there. if you don t know the chords, sit back and watch another instrument or ask someone playing for advice.if you re a percussionist you should ask about the tempo, or set the tempo yourself if you know the skill levels of your fellow musicians.    in general, you play through the song  as written  briefly, sometimes with vocals, so that everyone gets used to the feel of the song. if you re improvising the song on the spot, this is a good way to get everyone on the same page. keep the first minute or two simple so that everyone can get used to the structure. once everyone is on the same page the fun can begin.    more often than not, one or two people will emerge as the  leaders  of the jam, keeping everyone on time and noting when people should take solos. as you play, keep your head up and watch the other musicians keep the band together. eye contact, brief signaling, and even talking about upcoming chords or changes will help everyone stay on the same page.   as you get more comfortable with your fellow musicians, you can often hear when there is space for a solo and when the rhythm is changing, but you should still be looking up for visual cues from time to time. watch any improvisational or jam band play live    you ll notice small moments when the musicians make eye contact through the show, usually before changes, solos, or the song s end.  if everyone else starts playing fewer notes, calming the energy down, come down with them. if things start to pick up in volume and intensity, let your own volume grow slowly. in most jams, no one instrument is supposed to take over the entire song. each player needs to be aware of the rest of the band so that the song grows organically. while you play, listen to the entire sound of the band, not just your own instrument.   if you re struggling to keep up with every musician, hone in on the drummer. follow his lead in energy, tempo, and sound. feel free to adjust your playing, tempo, or melody, as long as it fits in with the rest of the band. you can help push the song in new directions as long as you don t try and take over the song.    musical improvisation takes a lifetime to master, so you re not expected to whip out a world class solo on the fly. improvisation is your chance to see where your instrument takes you, so relax and start experimenting. as long as you remember to stay in key, there is no wrong way to improvise, so just let go and have some fun.if you re new to improv, find a 4 5 note line you like and play it once or twice. then start to adjust it, changing 1 2 notes each time you play it so you get variations on the same simple theme. if you can mimic the vocal line or a common melody, you ll be sure to keep the song moving. don t feel the need to show off or be the best. just play what sounds good to you.  a jam is supposed to be an egalitarian, communal environment where everyone can feel free to let loose. no one enjoys it, however, when one person takes all the solos, or decides to solo for 2 3 minutes straight. if you re unsure what the protocol is, just listen into the other plays as they take solos or features. when your turn comes up, play for the same amount of bars  usually eight  as everyone else.   that said, some rock and roll groups, usually small, guitar driven bands, will jam on 4 5 minutes solos  see the grateful dead, phish, etc. . it is more about feeling the mood in your particular jam than adhering to a hard and fast rule.    once everyone s taken a solo, most musicians will start looking around for a cue when to end. in general, once all the musicians have made eye contact, someone will say or signal for  one more round  or to move to the outro, if the song has one. this helps everyone come to an end at the same moment.   as the song ends, cut the number of notes or beats you play in half to ease out of the song. it also makes it easier to stop on a dime if you miss the ending cue.    one of the best ways to learn to jam is to put on your favorite cd s and just start playing. this helps you train your ear to quickly pick up chord changes, rhythm, and melody, even if you don t necessarily know the song well. improvisation is a skill that only comes through practice, but that doesn t mean you need a full band with you every time you want to play.   remember to learn the rhythm and backing parts of the songs as well, not just the solos. to succeed in a jam, you need to be a part of the band as well as a willing improviser. if you play with several musicians regularly, ask them for 4 5 songs that they want you to learn, and offer them a few you like to play. the next time you meet your band will have a few more songs to jam on.  if you re going to a gospel bluegrass jam, you need to know how to play  i ll fly away  and a johnny cash song or two. if you re going to a rock or blues jam, you need to know the classic 12 bar blues format   stormy monday,   everyday i get the blues  , and a few beatles or rolling stones songs that everyone knows. if you re a jazz musician, you should have  summertime,   heart and soul,   bye bye blackbird,   round midnight  and several other jazz classics down pat.don t feel like you need to memorize tons of songs before you re able to jam. as you start playing, note the songs that come up frequently and make a point to learn them back to front. in many cases, jamming on a song is actually the best, and fastest, way to learn a song.  you should be able to find most notes on your instrument with ease. if you know where everything is you ll be able to quickly learn from others while jamming, picking up new melodies and chords for songs you don t know so well. you need to spend plenty of time practicing on your own, not just showing up and trying to wing it. the better you know your instrument, the more you can stop thinking and start playing.    you will never know every single chord or song that someone suggests, but having a good mental catalog of songs will help you quickly adapt to whatever song is being played. while it is by no means exhaustive, there are some common chord structures that any band could start with    a   d   e  frequently in 7ths for blues songs  g   c   d c   f   g g   am   d c   am   dm   g  while studying theory may seem like the antithesis of good improvisers, quality musicians know that music theory is the secret weapon that helps them adapt in any jam. knowing song, chord, and scale structures allows you to figure out songs on the fly because you can quickly predict where the song is going. chords are not smashed together randomly    there are certain principles and formulas that dictate what sounds good together and how each scale interacts with certain chords. if you want to be a quality jam player, you need to do your homework.

rolled so that there remains a brim on your paper plate. put a strip of glue onto the other side of construction paper to secure the tube of black construction paper.    use your scissors to poke a hole in the center of the paper plate. cut triangles into the center of the plate and fold them back.   the triangles will be formed when you cut the diameter of the circle you have just drawn both ways. cut the triangles in half again to better secure them onto the tube  stovepipe .    place craft glue onto the inside triangles on the paper plate and place them on top of the paper plate. press the glued triangles onto the inside of the stovepipe.   working upside down on this step will make it easier to affix the paper plate to the stovepipe. once you are finished pressing the glue onto the

query	INEX_XER-64	distinguish between a comic book and a graphic novel  the term  graphic novel  was first coined in 1964 by richard kyle in a newsletter published by the comic amateur press alliance. dc comics used the term in 1972 for the second issue of its  sinister house of secret love,  but the first use of  graphic novel  for standalone works came 4 years later, for richard corben s  bloodstar,  george metzger s  beyond time,  and jim steranko s  chandler  red tide.  the term s popularity was ensured in 1978 with the trade paperback publication of will eisner s  a contract with god, and other tenement stories,  which took its inspiration from the 1920s and  30s woodcut illustrated novels of lynd ward. because the practice of creating graphic novels pre dates the term, there is some confusion as to what constitutes a comic book and what constitutes a graphic novel. although there are no universally agreed upon definitions of either term, the following steps offer a set of things to look for in how to distinguish between a comic book and a graphic novel.  steps determine whether the publication is a periodical or a single work. note how many stories are contained between the pages. count how many pages the comic contains. observe the dimensions of the comic. see how the comic is bound. note the quality of the paper used. look at the price. finished.  although  comics  encompasses both comic books and graphic novels, a comic book is properly a magazine with volume and issue numbers. a graphic novel is properly a single publication, although some comic publishers have produced a line of graphic novels, as marvel comics did from 1982 to 1988 with its series of 35 works.   the use of the word  novel  in the pages of a comic book does not automatically make it a graphic novel. the 4 chapter  novel length  stories of all flash quarterly in the 1940s and the 3 part superman  novels  in action comics and superman of the late 1950s and early 1960s are not themselves graphic novels, because they were part of an overall comic book series of stories. a novel adapted to graphic form may or may not be a graphic novel. the novel adaptations in classics illustrated are not themselves graphic novels, because classics illustrated was published as a periodical. an adaptation of a single novel across several volumes, such as jane fancher s 3 volume adaptation of c.j. cherryh s  gates of ivrel,  although not covering the entire novel, may be considered a series of graphic novels by some and a graphic miniseries by others. some comics are designated  one shot  comics, such as  superman vs. muhammad ali,  published as an oversize  treasury  edition in 1978. these comics usually have their own volume and issue numbers, usually the number 1. one shots are not normally considered graphic novels.    a comic book may contain a single story, 2 stories, or as many as 3 or 4 stories between its pages, which may or may not all have the same characters. a graphic novel normally contains only a single story with the same cast of characters.   some bound reprint collections, such as  the greatest superman stories ever told  and  the greatest batman stories ever told,  are as thick as graphic novels. these are not properly graphic novels themselves, because they contain more than 1 story, even if the stories feature the same main character. they can be called graphic anthologies, as they follow the format of prose anthologies, which are collections of short stories within a single genre and often with a common theme. bound collections of single story arcs, such as frank miller s 1986  the dark knight returns,  which was originally published as a 4 issue miniseries, or alan moore and dave gibbons  1987  watchmen,  originally published as a 12 issue limited series, are graphic novels because the comic book story arc constitutes a single story within its pages. each story from the original multiple issue format constitutes a chapter within the graphic novel. there have been some exceptions to the  one story  definition for a graphic novel. will eisner s  a contract with god, and other tenement stories  was a set of interrelated short stories bound in the same volume.  it should be noted that the term  graphic novel  was used only on the trade paperback edition and not the earlier hardcover edition.     comic books have a fixed length, which ranged from 64 to 96 pages during the early 1940s and today is around 32 pages. graphic novels typically run longer, ranging anywhere from 60 to 500 pages. archie goodwin and gil kane s 1971  blackmark  ran 119 pages, and its sequel the following year ran 117, while the graphic novel collections of dave sim s  cerebus  are nicknamed  phone books  by their fans because of how thick they are.   many comics series produce special longer issues once a year. while these annuals may publish longer stories than the monthly comics with the same title, these cannot usually be considered graphic novels, even if they contain only a single story, as the issue is often identified with the word  annual  and usually bears an issue number.    comic books are typically published with a width of 6 5 8 inches  17 cm  and a vertical length of 10 1 4 inches  26 cm . graphic novels may be published with this length and width, with the dimensions of a trade paperback, an oversize  treasury  edition, or a digest size comic.   trade paperbacks have a width of 5.32 inches  13.5 cm  and a vertical length of 8.51 inches  21.6 cm . digest size has a width of 5 3 8 to 5 1 2 inches  13.65 to 13.97 cm  and a vertical length of 7 1 2 to 8 3 8 inches  19.05 to 21.27 cm .    comic books traditionally have been bound with staples, much like prose magazines of similar size. graphic novels, on the other hand, are usually bound the way thicker magazines and books are bound.   note, however, that some higher quality special comic books are bound like books. the individual volumes in the 3 issue  subterraneans  elseworlds miniseries featuring batman feature high quality paper and are not bound with staples, but the individual issues are not themselves graphic novels. the overall story, if bound in a single volume, would be a graphic novel.    for most of the decades they have been published, comic books have been printed on lower grade matte finish paper. graphic novels and anthologies published from the 1980s onward typically are published on a higher grade of paper, either matte or glossy finish. however, many recent comic books have also been published on slick paper, even though they are still held together with staples.    because of the limited scope of their stories, their being single publications, and the higher quality printing and binding, graphic novels usually cost more than comic books.   nan

query	QALD2_te-21	buy property in canada  a great starting point for anyone looking to buy property in canada. although this article is geared towards british buyers, it has general information of utility for all readers interested in purchasing canadian property as an outsider.  steps consider the reasons for choosing canada. look for the popular locations. buy a property. familiarize yourself with the purchase process. prepare to meet the costs. finance your purchase. understand the taxation system. sort out your passports, visas and residency. understand the available communications.  increasing numbers of british people are choosing canada as the location for their second home, attracted by its spectacular scenery, laid back lifestyle, political and social stability. easier travel and increasing coverage by low cost airlines are also considerations, as is the fact that canada s international homes market is still young and developers seeking to attract british buyers therefore have to provide good value.   the canadian residential property market has performed well in recent years, and is only suffering from the global recession by the economy s association with world markets. residential property is generally cheaper than in the uk, which, along with historically healthy capital appreciation, makes it an attractive investment for british second home purchasers or those looking to emigrate permanently. canada is said to have weathered the global recession better than almost any other developed economy in the world, the government having put aside money when times were good and there was a budget surplus for 12 years. the problems currently being seen by canadian companies are almost exclusively as a result of their exposure to global markets. this give property in canada a real chance of surviving the recession well, despite fact that prices are currently on the slide.    down the years, intrepid britons have immigrated to every part of canada. for those contemplating the purchase of a holiday home, however, travel time and cost will probably govern the choice of location. these will vary considerably depending on whereabouts in the uk you live. owing to the comparative ease of travel, british second home purchasers have traditionally favoured eastern canada. however, the recent introduction of low cost transatlantic services has led to increased interest in western areas. purpose built resorts are also proving popular. we hope this guide provides a place to start. there are many resources to help with further research, including television and radio programs, magazines, the internet and property exhibitions, as well as estate agents in both the uk and canada.   eastern canada   homes in eastern canada are generally cheaper than comparable ones in the west. traditionally, montreal has had the lowest residential property prices of canada s major urban areas. however, they are now increasing rapidly, so this may be a good place to consider investing. the area has much to offer. beautiful countryside and excellent sporting facilities, including skiing, are within easy reach. the us is 40 minutes to the south. boston and new york are six hours  drive away, or an hour by air. there are several daily flights to london, in a flight time of approximately seven hours. because of its strong rental market, toronto is also growing in popularity. rental yields in both toronto and montreal have held up well despite the credit crunch. vancouver   british columbia, canada s westernmost province, is also one of its most beautiful, with glorious mountains, lakes, rivers and beaches. it has canada s most temperate climate and some of its friendliest people. vancouver, the largest city, is the most expensive area of canada for residential property. the city, with the neighbouring ski resort of whistler, is to host the 2010 winter olympics, a fact that has to lead to further price increases. transport links with the uk are improving. there are direct daily services from london to vancouver  flight time approximately 9.5 hours . the rocky mountains   many people visit the rocky mountains on holiday and fall in love with this spectacular area. however, property tends to be expensive and, as much of it is situated within national parks, out of bounds to most purchasers. an area worth considering is canmore in alberta. given that it is next to the banff and kananaskis national parks, only an hour s drive from calgary s international airport  flight time to london approximately nine hours  and in a temperate climate zone, it is no surprise that canmore has doubled its population since it hosted the winter olympics in 1988. prices are relatively low, but increasing. prices are also rising in calgary, a young city with a strong first time buyer market. resorts   canada is the world s tenth most popular tourist destination but still offers great potential for growth. recognizing this, the government has invested huge sums in tourism, particularly in the east, which until recently was largely neglected as a holiday destination. consequently, resort developments are now big business. more and more britons are seeing the advantages of buying resort properties. many of them are skiers frustrated by the costs and crowds of european skiing. however, most resorts, even those offering winter sports, are now year round, with family oriented attractions. these factors help to extend the rental season and attract a wider range of purchasers. as a bonus, build quality is generally high, maintenance is arranged by a management company and capital appreciation tends to be excellent, particularly in eastern canada.    know the rules and regulations. regulations on property purchase vary throughout canada, so it is important to find out about them when you are researching an area. in british columbia, new brunswick, newfoundland, nova scotia, ontario and quebec, for example, there are no restrictions on foreign ownership, provided you spend less than six months per year in canada. however, in banff, which is located within a national park, only businesses and employees of the park can own property, and even they can do so only through renewable 42 year leaseholds.   each province has a different limit on the amount and kind of land that can be owned. unless buying a new property from a developer, potential purchasers are required to register with an estate agent  realtor .    the purchase process in canada is different from that in the uk and elsewhere, and the practice of gazumping is unknown. as the majority of canadian realtors cooperate in multiple listings, one realtor can usually access information on all available properties in an area. once you have chosen a property, you should appoint an independent realtor  or buyer s agent  to represent your interests. in the majority of real estate transactions, the seller pays both the realtors involved. your agent will draft an offer to purchase, which will then be submitted with a deposit, which is refundable should the sale fall through. once the offer is signed by both vendor and purchaser and any conditions  for example, mortgage approval  are met, the sale can proceed.    transactions costs in canada, while varying from province to province, usually comprise between 4.7 and 11 per cent of the property price, making it one of the cheaper places to buy from a fees perspective. a goods and services tax  gst  of 7 per cent and a provincial sales tax  pst  of up to 10 per cent are usually included in the asking price of new homes. alberta is the only province that does not levy pst.   in new brunswick, newfoundland and labrador and nova scotia, gst is combined with an 8 per cent provincial retail sales tax to form harmonized sales tax  hst  of 15 per cent. subject to certain conditions, gst and hst can be reduced or avoided  see taxation section . buying costs vary between provinces, but purchasers should allow up to  2,000 for legal fees, a survey and insurance. purchase tax of between 0.5 per cent and 2 per cent of the price is also payable.    when working out how to finance your purchase, consider all the options. paying cash, if you can afford to do so, is often recommended, but you may not want to tie up a relatively large sum in this way. the other options are remortgaging your uk home or arranging a mortgage on your canadian property through a canadian or uk lender. remortgaging offers the easiest solution. releasing equity in a uk home means that the second home can be purchased for cash, without the need for another mortgage. however, this may only be feasible for those who own their first home outright.   several uk mortgage providers will lend funds of up to 80 per cent of the purchase price for second home purchase over, typically, a 15 year term.    canada s tax system   both the federal and provincial governments impose income taxes, which together make up more than 40 per cent of total tax revenue. taxes are progressive, the wealthy paying a higher percentage of their income than the less well off. canada has no inheritance tax as such. inheritance is treated as the disposal of an asset and is therefore subject to capital gains tax, currently 25 per cent.   a number of other federal, provincial and local taxes are payable by individuals, including sales taxes  see costs section of buying a property  and property taxes. residential properties are subject to annual local taxes of between 0.5 per cent and 2 per cent of their value. taxation of non residents   non residents pay federal and provincial income tax on canadian sourced income. as the uk has a comprehensive double taxation treaty with canada, taxes paid in canada may reduce uk liability. gst and hst are charged on new homes purchased for private use. however, in some circumstances   for example, if the owner of a resort property commits it to a rental pool and uses it for 10 per cent of the year or less   a home is classified as commercial property and not subject to tax. rental income is taxed at 25 per cent, but expenses can be offset against tax. a non resident selling a property in canada must pay capital gains tax of 25 per cent, levied on a percentage of the profit.      passports and visas   to enter canada as a visitor, a uk national must be in possession of a standard 10 year passport. visas are not generally necessary, though there are some exceptions. non residents can spend up to six months per year in canada. residency   permanent resident status gives a non canadian the right to live in canada. certain residency obligations must be met in order to maintain it. those desiring permanent residence must apply for landed immigrant status. as this is a complicated process, it is wise to consult a lawyer specializing in immigration.      telephone   an excellent service is provided throughout canada, using modern technology, through a number of national and provincial phone companies. as in the uk, coin operated telephones are available in many public places, and payphones accepting major credit cards are increasingly common. nearly all the phone companies produce pre paid phone cards for domestic and international use. these are sold in a variety of outlets, including petrol stations, pharmacies and post offices. some companies also produce affinity cards, whereby the cost of a call is debited from the caller s credit or debit card account. internet   most major cities and even some smaller towns now have internet cafe s. many large hotels, public libraries and other establishments also offer internet access.

cheaper to just bedazzle them yourself. high heels and wedges are the most popular candidates for bedazzling, but you can also add some glitz and glam to more casual shoes, such as canvas sneakers or flip flops. the project can get a little time consuming, but the results are glamorous and totally worth it.  preparing the shoes applying the rhinestones finishing the job choose the shoes you want to bedazzle. wipe the shoes down with a damp, cotton cloth. plan out your design. buy your rhinestones. buy or make a jewel setter, if needed. pour the rhinestones onto a tray. apply a strong adhesive to a small patch on the shoe. pick up a crystal with the jewel setter. press the rhinestone into the glue. apply the rhinestones to the rest of the shoe. wait for the glue to set. clean up any residue with acetone or rubbing alcohol. buff the rhinestones with a soft cloth, if needed. treat the shoes with care.  you can bedazzle just about any type of shoe, from wedges to heels, canvas sneakers to flip flops. plain shoes without a lot of embellishments  at least on the area you want to bedazzle  will work the best. news shoes will work the best, but you can use older ones as long as they are clean and in good condition.  because of how quickly they show wear and tear, flip flops and canvas sneakers should be new.    if the shoes are especially dirty, use rubbing alcohol instead. be careful if the shoes are made out of leather, however  rubbing alcohol can discolor leather shoes.you don t have to wipe down the entire show, but you need to wipe down the area you will be bedazzling.  you will be working with strong adhesives, so it will be difficult to fix mistakes. take a look at your shoes and now and decide where you want the rhinestones to go. because of how heavy the rhinestones can make the shoes, it s not recommended that you cover the entire shoe. here are some ideas to get you started   cover the entire heel portion on a pair of high heels or wedges. cover just the fabric part on a pair of canvas sneakers. consider covering just the rubber toe cap on canvas sneakers. keep in mind that the rhinestones may fall off. cover the straps on a pair of flip flops. depending on the material, be aware that the rhinestones may fall off.    silver or clear rhinestones will work with just about any shoe. you can also use colored rhinestones, but make sure that they look good on your shoe. you can use rhinestones that are all the same shape and size, or play around with different shapes and or sizes. if you are using rhinestones that are all the same size, it would still be a good idea to get a few odd sizes in order to fill in any gaps caused by curves.for a pair of high heels, wedges, or very expensive shoes, use tiny, high quality rhinestones. sizes between 5ss and 16ss will work especially well.large, plastic rhinestones will look tacky. if you are covering a pair of casual or inexpensive shoes, such as canvas sneakers or flip flops, you can use larger and less expensive rhinestones.  a jewel setter is a small, plastic stick with a ball of wax attached at the tip. if you can t find one, roll a small piece of wax into a ball, and stick it onto a toothpick. the ball should be about the size of a pinhead.this is only necessary for tiny rhinestones. if you can easily pick the rhinestone up with your finger, you don t need a jewel setter. you can also use a pair of jewelry tweezers. they look similar to cosmetic tweezers, except that the tip is longer and thinner. you can find them in the beading section of an arts and crafts store.    if you can t find a tray, a clean, plastic lid would also work. make sure that the flat, back side of each rhinestone is facing down, and the faceted side is facing up. this will make the rhinestones easier to pick up.if you are working with a lot of rhinestones, pour out only a small amount first. if you are working with different shapes and or sizes, it would be a good idea to sort them out first. use different trays lids if necessary.    use a toothpick, skewer, or popsicle stick to apply the adhesive to a 1 by 2 centimeter patch on the shoe. if you are bedazzling a heel on a high heel or wedge, start on the edge or back of the heel  don t start in the middle or top.  it is easier to work in small patches. it also prevents the glue from drying out too fast. use a strong adhesive, such as e6000 or gemtac. regular white school glue or tacky glue won t be strong enough for this. if the heel is covered in fabric, or if you are covering a canvas sneaker, you may be able to use a good quality fabric glue instead.    lightly tap the wax tip against the top of the rhinestone. the rhinestone should stick to the wax. don t press too hard against the rhinestone, however, or it will get stuck to the wax and not adhere properly to the glue.don t panic if you get some wax residue on the crystal. you will take care of that later. if you are working with large, chunky rhinestones, you can pick it up with your fingers instead. you can also pick up the rhinestone with a pair of jewelry tweezers. grip it by the sides.    once the rhinestone sticks, carefully lift the jewel setter away. use an orange stick or a toothpick to push the rhinestone into place, if needed.an orange stick is the same tool that manicurists use to push back cuticles. you can find it in the nail care section of more grocery stores and super markets. if you are using jewelry tweezers, be careful not to get any glue on them. if you did, wipe the glue off immediately.    always work in small, 1 to 2 centimeter patches. you can place them right next to each other for the ultimate sparkly look, for further apart for something more subtle. if your rhinestones are all the same size, you may need to use an odd sized one to fill in any gaps.if you are using a variety of sizes in a random pattern, start with the largest ones first, then fill the gaps in with smaller ones.  apply round rhinestones in off set lines, like bricks on a wall, to get the most coverage.applying square rhinestones in straight lines for a neat, geometric look. you don t have to cover the entire area with rhinestones. use tiny rhinestones to make patterns, such as simply daisies.  how long this takes depends on what type of glue you are using, so read the instructions on the package carefully. for example, e6000 will take 24 to 72 hours to set.drying times are not the same as curing times. if your glue has a curing time, then you must wait that long before wearing the shoes.    you can do this with a q tip or a brush. if you are using a brush, make sure it s one that you don t care about, because it will ruin the fibers. avoid soaking the area, however, or the acetone will dissolve the glue and cause the rhinestones to fall off.always test the acetone on a spare rhinestone, especially if it is made out of plastic. it can fog or dissolve certain types of plastic. if the rhinestone is made out of plastic, try scratching the adhesive off first. if it won t come off, try rubbing alcohol next  it is gentler than acetone. the adhesive will dry clear. if it is not very noticeable, it may sometimes be better to just leave it as it is.    this is only necessary if you got any wax or fingerprints on the rhinestones. gently wipe them down with a soft cotton or microfiber cloth until the residue is gone.  some of the rhinestones may eventually fall off, especially if they are in an area that bends a lot  such as rubber toe caps on canvas sneakers or straps on a pair of flip flops . even through the adhesive you used is very strong, avoid getting the shoes wet. this will help them last even longer.

query	QALD2_te-57	go to the moon  the moon is the closest body in space to earth, with a mean distance of 238,857 miles  384,403 km .   1    the first probe to fly by the moon was the russian luna 1, launched january 2, 1959.   2    ten years and six months later, the apollo 11 mission landed neil armstrong and edwin  buzz  aldrin on the sea of tranquility july 20, 1969. going to the moon is a task that, to paraphrase john f. kennedy, requires the best of one s energies and skills.   3     planning the trip to the moon or bust returning to earth plan to go in stages. pack for the trip. determine the launch window. lift off. achieve low earth orbit. transition to a trans lunar trajectory. achieve lunar orbit. transfer to the lunar lander. descend to the moon s surface. explore. pack up and go home. dock with the orbiting vessel. head back to earth. go for a landing.  despite the all in one rocket ships popular in science fiction stories, going to the moon is a mission best broken into separate parts  achieving low earth orbit, transferring from earth to lunar orbit, landing on the moon, and reversing the steps to return to earth.   some science fiction stories that depicted a more realistic approach to going to the moon had astronauts going to an orbiting space station where smaller rockets were docked that would take them to the moon and back to the station. because the united states was in competition with the soviet union, this approach was not adopted  the space stations skylab, salyut, and the international space station were all put up after project apollo had ended. the apollo project used the three stage saturn v rocket. the bottom most first stage lifted the assembly off the launching pad to a height of 42 miles  68 km , the second stage boosted it almost to low earth orbit, and the third stage pushed it into orbit and then toward the moon.the constellation project proposed by nasa for a return to the moon in 2018 consists of a two different two stage rockets. there are two different first stage rocket designs  a crew only lifting stage consisting of a single five segment rocket booster, the ares i, and a crew and cargo lifting stage consisting of five rocket engines beneath an external fuel tank supplemented by two five segment solid rocket boosters, the ares v. the second stage for both versions uses a single liquid fuel engine. the heavy lifting assembly would carry the lunar orbital capsule and lander, which the astronauts would transfer to when the two rocket systems dock.    because the moon has no atmosphere, you have to bring your own oxygen so you have something to breathe while you re there, and when you stroll about on the lunar surface you need to be in a spacesuit to protect yourself from the blazing heat of the two week long lunar day or the mind numbing cold of the equally long lunar night   not to mention the radiation and micro meteoroids the lack of atmosphere exposes the surface to.you ll also need to have something to eat. most of the foods used by the astronauts in space missions have to be freeze dried and concentrated to reduce their weight and then be reconstituted by adding water when eaten.they also need to be high protein foods to minimize the amount of body waste generated after eating.  at least you can wash them down with tang.  everything you take into space with you adds weight, which increases the amount of fuel necessary to lift it and the rocket carrying it into space, so you won t be able to take too many personal effects into space   and those lunar rocks will weigh 6 times as much on earth as they do on the moon.    a launch window is the time range for launching the rocket from earth to be able to land in the desired area of the moon during a time when there would be sufficient light for exploring the landing area. the launch window was actually defined two ways, as a monthly window and a daily window.   the monthly launch window takes advantage of where the planned landing area is with respect to the earth and the sun. because earth s gravity forces the moon to keep the same side facing earth, exploration missions were chosen in areas of the earth facing side to make radio communication between earth and the moon possible. the time also had to be chosen at a time when the sun was shining on the landing area. the daily launch window takes advantage of launch conditions, such as the angle at which the spacecraft would be launched, the performance of booster rockets, and the presence of a ship downsite from the launch to track the rocket s flight progress. early on, light conditions for launching were important, as daylight made it easier to oversee aborts on the launch pad or before achieving orbit, as well as being able to document aborts with photographs. as nasa gained more practice in overseeing missions, daylight launches were less necessary  apollo 17 was launched at night.  ideally, a rocket bound for the moon should be launched vertically to take advantage of earth s rotation in helping it achieve orbital velocity. however, in project apollo, nasa allowed for a possible range of 18 degrees either direction from vertical without significantly compromising the launch.  in escaping the pull of earth s gravity, there are two velocities to consider  escape velocity and orbital velocity. escape velocity is the velocity needed to escape a planet s gravity completely, while orbital velocity is the velocity needed to go into orbit around a planet. escape velocity for earth s surface is about 25,000 mph or 7 miles per second  40,248 km hr or 11.2 km s , while orbital velocity at the surface is .orbital velocity for earth s surface is only around 18,000 mph  7.9 km s   it takes less energy to achieve orbital velocity than escape velocity.   furthermore, the values for orbital and escape velocity drop the further away from earth s surface you go, with escape velocity always about 1.414  the square root of 2  times orbital velocity.  after achieving low earth orbit and verifying that all ship s systems are functional, it s then time to fire thrusters and go to the moon.   with project apollo, this was done by firing the third stage thrusters one last time to propel the spacecraft toward the moon.along the way, the command service module  csm  separated from the third stage, turned around, and docked with the lunar excursion module  lem  carried in the upper part of the third stage. with project constellation, the plan is to have the rocket carrying the crew and its command capsule dock in low earth orbit with the departure stage and lunar lander brought up by the cargo rocket. the departure stage would then fire its thrusters and send the spacecraft to the moon.    once the spacecraft enters the gravity of the moon, fire the thrusters to slow it down and place it in orbit around the moon.    both project apollo and project constellation feature separate orbital and landing modules. the apollo command module required that one of the three astronauts remain behind to pilot it, while the other two boarded the lunar module.project constellation s orbital capsule is designed to be run automatically, so that all four of the astronauts it is designed to carry could board its lunar lander, if desired.  because the moon has no atmosphere, it is necessary to use rockets to slow the lunar lander s descent to about 100 mph  160 km hr  to ensure an intact landing and slower still to guarantee its passengers a soft landing.ideally, the planned landing surface should be free of sizable boulders  this is why the sea of tranquility was chosen as the landing site for apollo 11.  once you land on the moon, it s time to take that one small step and explore the lunar surface. while there, you can gather lunar rocks and dust for analysis on earth, and if you brought along a collapsible lunar rover as the apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions did, you can even hot rod on the lunar surface at up to 11.2 mph  18 km hr . don t bother to rev the engine, though  the unit is battery powered, and there s no air to carry the sound of a revving engine, anyway.     after you ve done your business on the moon, pack up your samples and tools and board your lunar lander for the return trip.   the apollo lunar module was designed in two stages  a descent stage to get it down to the moon and an ascent stage to lift the astronauts back into lunar orbit. the descent stage was left behind on the moon  and so also was the lunar rover .  the apollo command module and the constellation orbital capsule are both designed to take astronauts from the moon back to earth. the contents of the lunar landers are transferred to the orbiters, and the lunar landers are then un docked, to eventually crash back to the moon.  the main thruster on the apollo and constellation service modules is fired to escape the moon s gravity, and the spacecraft is directed back to earth. on entering earth s gravity, the service module thruster is pointed toward earth and fired again to slow the command capsule down before being jettisoned.    the command module capsule s heat shield is exposed to protect the astronauts from the heat of re entry. as the vessel enters the thicker part of earth s atmosphere, parachutes are deployed to slow the capsule further.   for project apollo, the command module splashed down in the ocean, as previous manned nasa missions had done, and was recovered by a navy vessel. the command modules were not re used.for project constellation, the plan is to touch down on land, as soviet manned space missions did, with splashdown in the ocean an option if touchdown on land is not possible. the command capsule is designed to be refurbished, replacing its heat shield with a new one, and reused.
query	QALD2_te-58	tell time without a clock  for many people,  knowing the correct time  is vital to everyday life. if you re in an unfamiliar environment without any kind of clock, however, figuring out the time could be a matter of safety and  survival . without a clock or watch, finding the  exact  time may not be possible, but you can figure the approximate time using the sun, moon or stars.  sun position reading the moon north star clock make note of the position of the sun. estimate the number of hours between sunrise and sunset. divide the sun s path into segments. determine which segment the sun is in. find the moon. imagine the moon is a circle divided into vertical strips. read the moon from right to left, following an imaginary horizontal half line. observe the moon s position in the sky. locate the big dipper constellation. determine the raw time. add one hour for every month after march 7. double the time. subtract the time from 24. correct for daylight saving time and time zone variation.  if you re in the northern hemisphere, face the south  if you re in the southern hemisphere, face north.  if you don t have a compass, use one of these techniques.  in other words, look at the equator  that is the line the sun generally follows in the sky. it always rises in the east  which is to your left if you re facing south, to your right if you re facing north  and sets in the west.   if the sun is in the exact center of the sky, it s exactly noon. a nickname for this is  high noon  because the sun is at its highest at noon and the time will be 12 00 pm, but this assumes no daylight saving time, and that you re in the middle of your time zone. for instance, in salt lake city, utah  us ,  high noon  is actually at 1 30 pm in the summer because there s an hour added by daylight saving and another thirty minutes added because the city is that time distance  west  away from the center of the time zone.if the sun is not in the exact center, you will have to do more figuring. if it is morning, the sun will be in the eastern half of the sky. if it is afternoon, the sun will be in the western half. you can use fractions to divide the sky into hours, and find the approximate time.          this varies depending on the season and location. winter days are shorter than summer ones  about ten and fourteen hours, respectively. spring and fall days tend to be about twelve hours long, especially close to the equinox  late march or late september .    if you re looking towards the equator, you can imagine the sun following an imaginary arc from east to west, beginning and ending at the horizon, even if it s obscured. visualize dividing that arc into equal segments  the number of segments should equal the number of hours in the day. if you know there are twelve hours in a day, you would divide the arc into twelve equal parts, six on the eastern half and six on the western half.   if you re having trouble visualizing the sky in segments, you can use your hand or fist to  measure  segments. going hand over hand, count the amount of fists from one end of the arc to the zenith  the highest point of the sky . take that number as half of a day. for instance, if you counted 9 fists, and you know the day is 12 hours long, nine fists would be equal to six hours. to figure out how much time each fist represents, divide the number of hours by the number of fists. one fist, then would equal 6 divided by 9   or about 2 3 hours  40 minutes . this is your hours per fist.     starting in the east, count how many segments there are before you get to the segment that the sun is in. that will tell you how many daytime hours have passed. the segments that the sun hasn t touched yet indicate how many daytime hours are remaining. if you know the time of high noon, sunrise, or sunset in your area, then you can approximate the current time.   using the salt lake city example given earlier, let s say there are fourteen segments  because it s summer  and the sun is on the ninth segment  from the east . the eighth segment  right after the highest point  begins at 1 30 pm. the ninth segment begins one hour after that, so if the sun is in the ninth segment, it s probably between 2 30 and 3 30 pm. if the sun was in the sixth segment, the time would be between 11 30 am and 12 30 pm. with practice, you ll be able to estimate time without consciously dividing the sky. if you used the fists method, count the number of fists from the eastern end of the arc to the sun. multiply that number times the hours per fist measurement. let s say you counted three fists from east to west. three hours times forty minutes equals 120 minutes, or two hours. so it s been two hours since sunrise. if you know the time of sunrise in your area and season, you can approximate what time it is.    if the moon is full, stop here and follow the instructions for telling time based on sun position. if it s a new moon  i.e. you can t see the moon  this technique will not work.    the number of vertical strips equals the number of hours in the night, with the first hour at the right edge and the final hour at the left edge. as discussed earlier, the number of nighttime hours can vary by season and location. let s assume twelve hours, beginning at 6 pm and ending at 6 am, for now.    look for where that line intersects the border between light and dark. make note of which strip that intersection is in. if as you read from right to left, the moon goes from light to dark, that strip where the intersection is located tells you when the moon will set in the west  moonset . if the transition is from dark to light, then you can determine when the moon will rise in the east  moonrise . in this instance, the intersection is at 8 pm, and the transition from right to left is from light to dark. this tells us that the moon will set in the west at 8 pm.       this moon will set at about 7 8 hours after sunset. if sunset is at 7 pm, you can expect moonset at 2 3 am.       if the moon is just a tiny sliver on the right, it sets within an hour or two since the night began. if you see it, you re probably within the first hour or two of nighttime, since the moon hasn t set yet.       if the moon is just a tiny sliver on the left, it rises within an hour or two before dawn. if you see the moon in this phase, you can expect the night to be over within one or two hours.          divide the moon s path into segments, as described for the sun above. for the purposes of this example, let s assume twelve equal segments for twelve hours in the night.   if you know the moonrise time, estimate how many hours  segments  it already passed since it rose in the east. add those hours to the moonrise time to get your current time. if you know the moon rose at 9pm, for example, and it s right in the middle of a 12 hour path, that means it s completed 6 hours since it rose at 9 pm. 6 hours after 9 pm is 3 am.       if you know the moonset time, estimate how many hours  segments  it has to go before it sets in the west. let s say you know the moon will set at 2 am in the west. if the moon is positioned about 2 segments away from the western end of the arc, that means it has two hours before it sets. two hours before moonset  2 am  is 12 am  midnight .          you ll only be able to do this in the northern hemisphere and if the skies are clear. in the summer, the big dipper will be closer to the horizon.    the two pointers in the big dipper  the two stars furthest away from the handle  are in line with the north star  polaris . this line is like a clock hand, with polaris at the center of the clock  as you look north, 12 is at the top of the clock, and 6 is at the bottom. when you imagine this clock, what time is it  let s say the  hand  falls at 2 30. this is the raw time.    likewise, subtract one hour for every month before march 7. if it s may 7, two months after march 7, then you d add two hours to your raw time, making it 4 30. to be more exact, add or subtract two minutes for every day after or before the 7th, respectively. if it s february 2, it s one month and five days before march 7, so you d subtract one hour and ten minutes from 2 30  making it 1 20 .   the reason we focus on march 7 is because the star clock always reads 12 00 at midnight on this date, so this is our  base  date, and we have to  adjust the clock  for any other date.   nan  if the time from the previous step is more than 24, then subtract it from 48. we do this because the clock actually goes backwards  counterclockwise  and this subtraction corrects for that. the result will be the real time, given in 24 hour time  military time in the u.s. and canada . that means that if your result is more than 12, you can convert it to pm.    if daylight saving time is in effect, add an hour. if you live close to the western edge of your time zone, add a half hour. likewise, if you live on the eastern edge of your time zone, subtract half an hour. now you know the time   
query	QALD2_te-67	become enlightened  there is no conceivable barrier to prevent any individual entity from expanding into enlightenment. if we really want to go, nothing can stop us. to become  enlightened , know that there are no special virtues to acquire. simply remain conscious. the practice of prolonging our conscious state may not give us the power to control the material world. it will, however, give us the power to be absolutely free from the material world. being enlightened is not a special state of mind  it is the mind s and heart s freedom from all clinging which gives rise to an awareness of all human experience without a notion of identity separate from the world around us. though this may seem difficult, it is possible through practice and training of the mind. let go and let it happen. just as worldly achievements are difficult, but possible, enlightenment too, may seem difficult in the light of reason, but possible. our human intelligence is of little use to us when we simply become cosmic consciousness. this happens little by little and there are as many ways to gauge your progress as there are entities on that path.  steps we have all made mistakes. seek the company of arhats, wise people, and good dharma books. create time in your life to be conscious. sit quietly and let your thoughts and judgments arise and dissipate by themselves. make special note of the various odors you smell, the noises you hear, and objects you see. practice meditation, which you can do anywhere, at any time by simply steadying the mind on an object of concentration in the present moment. read what others have written about enlightenment and spirituality in general. learn about the noble eight fold path and understand the 4 noble truths always be mindful of the moment and take pleasure in all activities that you do during the day  eating, sleeping, even using the bathroom . the steps listed here are basic possible helpful practices. the way to enlightenment as described by shakyamuni   gautama buddha himself is through developing virtue, concentration, and wisdom. enlightenment is not a state of mind that you can force yourself into. when approached with intent, sparking higher consciousness is natural.  that seems to be how we learn.  repeating the same mistakes over and over is what is injurious to our own purpose. however we are free to do that as well. what we should ask ourselves is    what is the cause of pain and suffering and how can we uproot it at a deep level   some say that it is only through excess, that one can know what is enough. being here now is thought by many to be the first step towards liberation.   nan  too often, we get so tense or stressed with our responsibilities that we forget to take pleasure in the moment.    remain in the here and now. become calm and clear.    approach other everyday situations in the same way. doing this often brings you closer to pure consciousness.    many of the great philosophers such as gautama, jesus, lao tzu, shunryu suzuki, mohammed, dante, francis bacon, william blake and others. the doors of perception has much to say about this subject, both directly and indirectly.    a real  step  towards enlightenment would be to make something that is now an unconscious part of you conscious. i.e.  integration . practical steps toward integration can be found in the related how to wikis.    we live by the eternal law of cause and effect, which is, if you do something bad you will get a bad result, if you do something good you will get a good result. what matters is the consciousness you experience regardless of what takes place.    walking can spark higher consciousness. use walking meditation. just like aspirants learn to count their cycle of breath to consume normal and allow higher consciousness to come forth. the cycles or steps in walking can serve this same purpose. this same thing happens in music with the rhythm, that is, normal consciousness is consumed, allowing higher to consciousness come flooding in for the musician, bringing forth the higher consciousness. don juan put the flooding of images into walking for carlos castaneda. carlos hiked with don juan while having his eyes crossed in order to flood the vision and insure the total consumption of normal consciousness. this awareness of higher consciousness while walking will motivate more walking meditation and ability to walk meditate more and more.

query	QALD2_te-8	go trekking in the himalayas   himalayas , also known as   the abode of snow   and      shangri la   forming the earth s highest mountain region, with 9 of the 10 highest peaks in the world. the highest mountain range forming a broad continuous arc for nearly 2600 km  1600 mi  along the northern fringes. every year the thousands of trekkers, mountaineers, pilgrims visit the region, famous not only for the most inhospitable heights and tough terrains but also the most beautiful scenic beauty on the earth to feel rejuvenated on your way back to your home.  here are few travel tips in the himalayas    steps do the necessary pre research  before, you plan to come, do your research on the region you would like to visit for trekking and for that you may take help through different search engines on the internet that will provide you information regarding the area, local tours and guides. know the region  the himalayan mountain chain is spread southeast to northwest across the asian continent. planning and preparation  the first and foremost part is that you like hiking in the first place  physical condition  when you are planning to trek in himalayas, it demands a degree of physical fitness in which muscles are conditioned to take the rigors of ascent and descent in long marches. mental condition  mental preparation is more complex than physical condoning. preparation for the trip  there are various factors to consider, both mental and physical, in preparation for the trip. food and fitness  first rule for anyone interested in trekking in the himalayan region is that one must be good in physical and mental condition. altitude sickness  no other mountains deserve the kind of respect the himalaya do in terms of altitude. the trekker medical kit  should include wound disinfectants, band aids in different sizes, gauze pads and rolls, mosquito repellents if crossing malarial areas, thermometer, analgesics, and anti inflammatory and other antibiotics as prescribed by a doctor from a travel clinic.  you can register with the region s local licensed tour company to make your travel easier. the climate and geography is complex, so when considering your trip you need to plan carefully where to go, when to go and what your budget is.    in the east, the himalaya originates from a knot between myanmar, tibet  now under china  and india. the chain continues to the border of bhutan. beyond that lies sikkim, home to many peaks including the world s third highest, kangchenjunga. the himalayan range west of sikkim forms part of nepal until you reach the border of kumaun and garhwal. from here the indian himalayan chain continues without a break through kinnaur, spiti, ladakh and lastly east karakoram range. knowing the region may help you choose the suitable area for the trekking depending on the type of trekking terrains you want to choose.    consider some short hikes nearby home to develop basic fitness, start by walking slow in the beginning and gradually increasing your pace. consider carrying a backpack, camping for days together, walking on rough trails, the different food. this will help you to select the trek best suited to you. walking alone or with few friends can be wonderful, though it is easier for the young as you need to put more than walking into your day. if you plan to camp out and cook, develop stamina. if you plan to stay in local homes or tea houses, than you must know the language a little, learn the basics like greeting and common phrases used by locals.    a trek is enjoyed more if you are not particularly tired on reaching the camp after a day s march. even if you are only moderately conditioned at the outset, it will not take more than 2 to 3 days to become almost fully conditioned after a week you will either be perfectly tuned or completely fed up, depending upon your mental and physical responses. enjoy your walk keeping in tune with the demands of the land.    the experience is likely to be a cultural surprise cum shock which you must learn to absorb. you need to adjust, at least temporarily, to the ways and responses of the people and sights encountered wherever you happen to travel. only those read few books about the himalayas will not acquaint you with the region from authentic sources. most europeans who have never visited india and nepal before have wrong ideas and notions about the country. the initial experience   the heat, the noise and the street life, the vibrant colors and the multitudes of people   may bewilder and exhaust the first   time visitor, but the country and its people are friendly and hospitable. once you have spent some time here everything will fall into place, and you will be amply rewarded with your first glimpse of the himalayan peaks, one of the most spectacular mountain ranges in the world.          physical conditioning of the cardiovascular system with aerobic exercise. background reading, maps etc. wear warm clothes as climate in such higher altitude areas remain very cold throughout the year. camping and cooking equipment  this depends on the style of trekking, but if you are totally equipping yourself then you could consider the following  sturdy rain proof tent. sleeping bag with liner and foam mattress. backpack, day pack and probably a duffel bag to keep in storage in hotels while on trek. a kerosene stove that can be cleaned easily, a leak proof fuel container, lightweight pots, pans and cutlery. favorite food items.    good food is essential part of the trekking and here good food does not refer to costly delicacies but wholesome and nutritious diet. choice of food is limited once you leave the town and head for wilderness. in many villages there are no food outlets and the trekkers have to be on their own for food. one should drink boiled water or tea mostly to avoid dehydration. however freshly cooked food has no substitute as tinned food losses its taste after some time. trekkers should carry dry fruits, chocolates, sweets, soup packets, coffee powder, a biscuit, butter cheese, noodles etc.    as the himalayan rescue association likes to point out,  the himalaya starts where other mountains leave off.  remember it is the sleeping altitude that is critical. if you ascend to an area of high altitude, you are likely to experience some form of altitude sickness. usually, the symptoms are mild and will improve if you descend. what counts as high altitude   high altitude refers to heights that are between 1,500 and 3,500m above sea level. very high altitude is from 3,500 to 5,500m above sea level. extreme altitude is from 5,500 to 7,500m above sea level. the way to prevent altitude sickness is to give the body enough time to get used to the rarefied air. a slow and steady ascent is vital. adequate hydration is also helpful. the body is constantly losing fluid from the lungs and the skin in the high, dry environment. drink enough to maintain a clear and abundant urine output. other measures include eating a high carbohydrate diet, climbing high during the day and coming lower down to sleep, and to mild to moderate activity during the rather than just lie around. almost all altitude problems can be avoided if symptoms are recognized and acted upon. the warning signs are headache, lack of appetite, nausea, feeling of tiredness, and sometimes vomiting. this stage of mild mountain sickness can be treated with aspirin or diamox for headache and something mild for the nausea and vomiting.    always ask your doctor for advice and read the patient information that comes with your medicine.

query	QALD2_tr-17	make your own fantasy world  have you ever daydreamed about a magical world, but never gotten around to putting all your thoughts on paper  this article can help you take the next step. follow along with our tips, and you ll have a wonderful, fantastic world in no time   defining your world s culture mapping your world make it real decide what the inhabitants are like. think up a name for your world. terraform your world. create the wildlife of your world. create the history of the world. decide the religion of your world. decide upon or create the language the people will speak. create folklore. roughly map out each country s daily life. make a map. start naming your places. draw a rough sketch of your map. add a map key. color your map. create individual maps of countries. type everything up and print it out as a book.  start by imagining what basic kind of world you are envisioning, and what their lives must be like. this will help you shape the  feeling  of your world.   is it a peaceful world, without wars, anger, or violence  or is it a world that s falling apart at the seams, with crime, mayhem, and battles  knowing that, you can start describing your inhabitants. create them, write their histories, cultures, ways of living, weapons, food, education, governments, transport, anything. are there multiple races, like fish lizards and sentient octopods wandering around  what conflicts occur between different races  define the extent of the culture. it can be a single dominant culture, like the klingon empire, or it can be a number of different cultures, with different customs, like earth.    you can change it later, if you like, but it s good to start somewhere. one way to do it is to use your own name as a basis.   for example, lilithopia has a nice sound to it, especially if it s a pretty world, filled with flowers. zachtopia, maybe not so much  but if you dropped the  ...topia  bit, and called it  zakchan,  or even just  zakh,  you have a good start. you could just say some random cool sounding thing.  kaiu, mikvar, etc.  maybe even a play on words.  guess what a catacloyapa would be like . names of cities in foreign countries can be used well. for example, ravonik or turan, from albania. make the name of your world reflect the inhabitants. for example, if it s a warlike world, calling your planet  bliss  might not be so good. on the other hand, if your world is populated by unicorns and elves, calling it  kzrakh  would not work at all. create different countries  design flags for each country, give it a unique name, and create the culture and customs that are both unique to them, and common to all the cultures of your world.    decide what the landscape of your world is like. where are the deserts  where are the mountains  the forests    think about how much of the world is covered in the various environments. for example, it could be a desert planet, an ice asteroid belt, or forest moon. or it could be more temperate, like our earth, but with different creatures and plants.    you can use a lot of wildlife from earth, but if you re feeling adventurous, make them all up  are they vertebrates  have a spine   invertebrates  don t have a spine   teeth, fangs, claws, scales, fur, wings, eyes, limbs and slime are some of the many things you can stick on them.   check out books about unusual bugs, and deep water sea life. those are some of the most unusual looking creatures in the world like aliens in our own back yard  what kind of animals do your inhabitants ride  figure out what the animal eats, and then figure out what eats the animals  building the ecosystem  what eats what, what s the top predator, how everything lives together  is a good way to learn more about the world you re creating. where in your world do all these creatures live  they can live in the sky, or under the lava beds. maybe they re ice worms that burrow through solid methane, or energy beings that can be both solid and light at the same time.    once you start getting an idea who your inhabitants are, and what they do, it s time to give them a past.   describe how they evolved from another life form or were created by god s . who or what created gave rise to the life on planet xyxyx  what major events have changed the course of the world  are there gods and or goddesses, has evolution shaped things, or is it a combination of the two  describe what your planet s cultures have done during their history. have there been wars  civil, international   strife  anarchies  rebellions  have they actually been quite peaceful     this is often a touchy topic for those who are incredibly faithful to their real world religion. just remember that you still believe in your deity, and that you are not transferring your faith in any way. just like writing a murder mystery doesn t turn you into a murderer, so will writing about other gods not turn you into a heathen.   is the dominant religion polytheistic  many gods , monotheistic  one god , pantheistic  everything is god , monistic  no god, only a holy energy , or atheistic  no gods   you get to define if they look like the inhabitants only a lot bigger and purple, or like little chipmunks with fangs. the field s wide open. are the gods animals  does each have a specific power  do they have one spouse or multiple spouses  do these gods exist, or are they made up  did anything predate these gods     do they speak english  french  spanish  or a completely new language  remember, if you re planning to write a book from this, which you might be, don t create a new language and have your characters use it all the way through. most will throw the book down in disgust, not being able to understand without constant reference.   to see how this was accomplished by a master, read lord of the rings. tolkien created complete languages so the characters would have a  history,  but he only used their language sparingly, for important things. it gives his world an air of authenticity that it might have otherwise lacked.    what are the myths of each country  create bedtime stories to scare children, make up fairy tales, and imagine legends with  more than a grain of truth in them,  or major prophecies  such as the mayan calendar prophecy      what games do children play  which countries are poor  which ones are rich  is it hard work or is there plenty of time for play     first, draw in land masses, like continents, and large bodies of water or other geographic features  if any  that your world possesses.   add technical boundaries. much like europe and asia, they are separate continents whose boundaries are defined by nature. add political boundaries  these are countries, states, and cities. take a look at google maps to see how these things are handled, and use that as a guide.    once you have the borders of your country defined, start adding names. work your way down from big to small, as the there will be few large features, and many small.   name your major features first  continents, oceans, deserts, forests, etc. give each country a capital city. locate and name major cities, then the names of countries, provinces, continents, oceans, deserts, forests, etc. this may seem overwhelming, but just relax and don t think about anything, just let the ideas flow. there s no rush. you can put it all in an imaginary box in your mind, or write notes down on paper. search for  random fantasy name generator  on google if you can t think of as many as you need.    exclude small islands to begin with. make sure to make the borders of the landmasses are jagged  like coastlines , not smooth and curvy  unless you have a very good, in your world reason for doing this, not just because you re lazy .   it helps to use a computer because it is easier to edit than on paper. add the small islands. remember, these islands can be made to be very important, economically and strategically.    use simple symbols like triangles for mountains and dots for cities  unless you re a bit of an artist, and you like drawing the mountains beautifully and drawing tiny little houses and castles for the cities .   then fill in the place names. be sure to make continent names in a larger size than country names, country names larger than city names, etc. don t forget to adjust the size of your city symbols and make a different symbol for capitals, countries and provinces.    this can be done any way you want, tweak it slightly, and voila  you have your map.    to do this you want the nearby countries to be grey or sepia colored. then color each province a different bright color. of course, if no countries exist  i.e you have a very early world, or one ravaged by war, or a peaceful, john lennon imagine kind of place , then you don t have to do this step.    you can write the introduction as if you were a professor studying this, and write the rest as if it were nonfiction. publish your information on the internet if you wish for everyone to see.   study anthropological writings about indigenous peoples, plants, or animals, to see how they describe them. or check out how national geographic writes about discoveries. adapt that style to your own descriptions.

query	QALD2_tr-21	change your name in illinois  whether you ve recently married or divorced, are tired of people misspelling your name, or just feel like you ve gone as far as you can in life as  john smith,  you may be interested in changing your name. in the state of illinois, you have several options to complete this process. after legally changing your name, however, you also have to remember to update your various forms of identification, financial and insurance accounts, and so on.  changing names by marriage or divorce changing names by court petition changing identification documents don t assume your name has changed through marriage or divorce. use your marriage license as valid proof for a name change. change your name as part of your divorce decree. use your official marriage license or divorce decree as your legal authorization to make additional name change measures. know the benefits and requirements of a legal name change. procure the necessary forms. file the paperwork at your county courthouse. publish notice in a local newspaper. attend your court hearing. know the minor differences in the process if you are a minor. change your name on your social security card first. change your driver s license or state id card. change your name on your bank accounts, then move on to credit cards, utilities, and so on.  while becoming less common for a variety of reasons, the tradition of a bride taking her new husband s last name is still the expectation for many after marriage. this  or any other  type of name change after marriage is not automatic, however, and requires some relatively simple but necessary actions on your part.   likewise, divorce does not automatically revert a changed last name to the pre marriage last name in illinois. again, a simple but necessary process must be taken.    an official, certified copy of your marriage license is sufficient cause in illinois to undergo a name change. no separate decrees or court orders are required.   until quite recently in many states, only brides could take on the husband s last name  or a hyphenated combination of both last names  using the marriage certificate as the only legal authorization. however, due to various legal challenges and especially the growing legalization of same sex marriage  valid in illinois since june 2014 , such policies are in flux. in illinois, both spouses are  entitled to a one time change of their last name, which includes hyphenation or taking the name of the other spouse. no change is required, though. illinois law in fact seems to indicate that a married person can take on an entirely new name through this process  not the spouse s name or hyphenated , but that again is an area that is somewhat vague in a rapidly changing field.  in illinois as in most states, the easiest way to change your name due to divorce is to make it a part of the divorce decree itself. when done this way, no separate legal actions or fees are necessary.   on general divorce decree forms that are valid in most if not all u.s. states, there is normally a section  at number nine on the example cited here  that authorizes a name change as part of the decree.this process, however, entitles you only to revert to your maiden name or another former legal name. otherwise, you will have to undertake a separate legal process.    one of these documents, along with proof of your previous legal name, should be all that is required to change your name on your social security card, illinois driver s license   id card, and other such changes.   see the relevant method in this article for useful information on making these changes.    it may seem like too much trouble to go through all the paperwork, fees, and a court appearance in order to change your name, but it is worthwhile to make the change you prefer official.   illinois, like many other states, permits you to change your name simply by consistently using that new name, but that type of change won t likely be accepted by the social security administration, your financial institutions, or even the state department of motor vehicles for your driver s license. official, certified documentation of a name change is they way to go. in illinois, you must be 18 years old and have lived in the state for at least six months in order to petition for a name change for yourself. there are also restrictions if you have a felony record or are a registered sex offender.  like any government process, there is some paperwork, some fees to pay, and some time to wait in order to make your name change official. the three forms you need, which are available online or from your county courthouse, include request for a name change. this is in essence your application form, in which you provide information about yourself, your reason for desiring a name change, and the new name you wish to have. this form must also be signed by a witness known to you  a signature by a notary is permissible but not required. notice of filing a request for name change. this document provides information to be published, by your request and at your expense, in a local newspaper that circulates within  or barring that, nearby  your county of residence. this may seem quaint, but advertising the proposed change in a newspaper is required by law. order for name change. this is the document the judge will sign and which orders your name to be legally changed  or not . if approved, this form  or any certified copies thereof  will be your key to changing your name at the social security administration, dmv, and so on.    fill out each of the three forms as indicated  but not areas specified for the clerk and or judge  and file them with the circuit clerk at the courthouse of the county in which you reside. bring three extra copies of each form along with the originals.the clerk will give you a hearing date  at least eight weeks after the filing date  and stamp your original forms and copies. you will be required at this time to pay a filing fee, which varies by county. you may also apply for a fee waiver at this time, however, if you have a financial hardship.    contact a newspaper in your county, or, if your county lacks one, a paper nearby. the court clerk should have information on available papers. provide the paper a stamped, completed copy of the notice for filing a request for name change form.the notice must appear in the newspaper once a week for three consecutive weeks, with the first appearance at least six weeks before your hearing date. publication fees are your responsibility. once your notice has run three times, make sure the newspaper provides you with a certificate of publication or sends it directly to the clerk. if it is given to you, file it with the clerk before your court date.    arrive early just in case, confirm your room number, and wait for your name and case to be called. make sure you bring the following with you stamped copies of the request for name change, notice of filing a request for name change, certificate of publication, and order for name change. a photo id with your current name. any additional documents related to your request, such as evidence regarding the passage of time since a criminal conviction. you may be questioned under oath by the judge, so answer truthfully. the judge will sign your request whether it is granted or denied. it it is granted, you can request additional copies of the order for name change from the clerk.    if you are under age 18, the name change process itself is quite similar, but the paperwork is different. also, at least one parent or guardian must approve of the change.   the forms you need are as follows  petition for change of name  minor   decree of change of name  minor   notice of motion   notice of publication . minor name changes only need to be advertised if one parent cannot be located. a non cohabiting, non consenting parent whose whereabouts are known must be sent the notice of motion and given the opportunity to attend the court hearing.    first, that is, after you possess a marriage certificate, divorce decree, or court order. taking this step before moving on to your driver s license and other identity documents makes the process much easier.   visit a social security administration office, and bring the following  completed form ss 5  application for a social security card, available at the office or online  a certified name change document  marriage license, divorce decree, or court order   a valid, government issued photo id  and proof of citizenship  birth, citizenship, or naturalization certificate . the full list of acceptable documents is available online.you can also

voter registration card and your vehicle title and registration at the sos office or online.  with a certified name change document, a new social security card, and a new driver s license, the process

query	QALD2_tr-22	write a limerick  a limerick is a short, comical, and almost musical poem that often borders on the nonsensical or obscene. it was popularized in english by edward lear  and thus limerick day is celebrated on his birthday, may 12 . writing them takes a little practice at first, but before long you ll be addicted to coming up with these witty, whimsical rhymes.  forming your limerick putting it together know the basic characteristics of a limerick. choose the ending of your first line. think of different words to rhyme with your first line s ending. make associations with the rhyme words. pick a story that appeals to you. make the first line nice and fitting with the meter. choose a situation or action in which your person starts off. think of a  turn  or  twist  in your story. wrap up the story with a punchline.  while there are slight variations in this style of poetry, they all fall within the same rhythmic umbrella. a true limerick has five lines  the first, second, and fifth rhyme with each other, and the third and fourth rhyme with each other. in addition to rhyme, consider    number of syllables. the first, second and fifth lines should have eight or nine syllables, while the third and fourth lines should have five or six. meter. a limerick has a certain  rhythm  created by how the syllables are stressed.  anapaestic meter   two short syllables are followed by a long  stressed  one  duh duh dum, duh duh dum . here s an example  note that the emphasis naturally falls on the italicized syllables   twas the night before christmas and all through the house  amphibrachic meter   a long  stressed  syllable is sandwiched between two short ones  duh dum duh, duh dum duh . example  there was a young lady of wantage lines can begin on two, one, or occasionally no unstressed beats. some prefer to continue the rhythm across from one line to the next, especially when a sentence carries across lines, but this is not essential.      knowing this first will help you mentally sift through rhymes. the ending of the initial line is usually a geographical place. take pittsburgh. note that the first syllable of pittsburgh is stressed, resulting in one short syllable at the end of the line. another example  new york. note that the second syllable of new york is stressed. this will create two very different limericks.   choosing a place like pottawattamie or xyz may embark you on a long, uphill poem writing battle. the more common the sound, the more rhymes you ll have at your disposal.  you don t have to choose a place  or that place doesn t have to be a city     there once was a girl in a shoe,  is more vivid than a girl living in a plain ol  city.      let the story and punchline of your limerick be inspired by the rhymes you think of. after all, a good limerick is cohesive and clever. let s go back to  pittsburgh  and  new york.    because pittsburgh is stressed on the first syllable, you ll have to rhyme with both syllables. first things that come to mind  kids lurk, zits work, bits jerk, hits perk, lit smirk, or maybe a different combination of these words. because new york is stressed on the second syllable, you only need to rhyme with that one. first things that come to mind  cork, pork, stork, fork. write your own extensive list.    the two examples we re using are already starting to form their own feel. for the steel city, with words like kids and zits and private bits, you could go for a limerick about puberty. and for the big apple, through the combination of cork, pork and fork, you could imagine a limerick about a fancy dinner with lots of meat and wine.   go through the list you created and think up little stories of what could have happened and how your ideas could be related. the association only has to be loose. sometimes, the more nonsensical, the funnier the limerick is. so long as it paints a picture in the reader s head, your limerick is successful.    decide on who the person s  is you introduce in line 1. what is important about him or her  do you focus on their profession or social status, or on age, health or particular stage in his or her life    for the pittsburgh limerick, you could go for the word  adolescent.  something everyone can relate to  for the new york limerick, you might be thinking of the word  distinguished  with something following that.    your word choice will determine which type of meter you employ  don t worry, you ll be able to hear what works and what doesn t. let s keep going with our two examples    example 1, adolescent and pittsburgh  adolescent is stressed on the 3rd syllable. pittsburgh starts with a stressed syllable. this means we need one more long syllable at the start, and only have room for one short syllable between  adolescent  and  pittsburgh.  so we might get   a young adolescent from pittsburgh.  example 2, distinguished and new york  distinguished is stressed on the second syllable. combined with  from new york,  that leaves us only two syllables for in between, with the second one stressed. you could solve this, for instance, by borrowing from a foreign language   the distinguished beau monde of new york.     this is the starting point of your story or joke. use one of the rhyming words from your list to complete your second line.   example 1   a young adolescent from pittsburgh, was just finding out how his bits work.  now that s a set up for limerickal success. example 2   the distinguished beau monde of new york, was heavily dining on pork.  note how the rhyme in line 2 seems to fit with the subject in line 1, while it actually is the other way around. audience fooled     while considering rhyming words for the 3rd and 4th line, save the punchline for your last line. the fun in the limerick comes in the 4 line wait for the kick at the end.   of course the  bits  story will probably get messy    excellent. because limericks often border on the obscene, you could have your hero s hormones take the best of him  without making it too explicit . how about   he dreamt every night, of a girl by his side   that s family friendly. example 2  thinking of cork and pork, maybe you notice how wine rhymes with swine. that would be a great follow up and set your imagery well.    go back to your list of rhyme words and find a nice one to cinch it all together. this is the most difficult part. don t be put off if your first few limericks aren t funny enough. remember that it s first of all a matter of taste, and second  everything takes practice. and sometimes it s just a matter of finding the right initial word to set up your rhymes    our pittsburgh example evolved nicely   a young adolescent from pittsburgh, was just finding out how his bits work. he dreamt every night, of a girl by his side, but his zits seemed to make all the kids smirk.  the new york one did, too.  the distinguished beau monde of new york, was heavily dining on pork. they drank so much wine, that instead of the swine, many were chewing on cork.

finally, give the company permission to use any images, video, or audio that they may capture of you while on the job for their own purposes.    learn the history of the specific disney company that you are applying to, as well as disney as a whole. you don t have to memorize every single fact and detail, but absorb enough to demonstrate a more than passing familiarity with your potential employer in your cover letter and interviews. prove yourself to be someone who is passionate about contributing to the company s overall mission, rather than someone who is just seeking a job from the first employer who is willing to hire them.    disney companies pride themselves on promoting current employees to fill higher positions, so if you are holding out for one of those, readjust your expectations. content yourself with an entry level position at first. from there, aim higher. excel at your original position. earn a reputation for reliability, capability, and team spirit, while networking constantly between your peers, supervisors, and other management.if you are deadset on skipping the entry level positions and landing yourself a high profile position right away, be sure that you can offer an in demand skill that they desperately need. disney companies have a huge workforce to choose from, so set yourself apart from current employees by offering a unique specialization that few other candidates could boast.    unless you offer a rare set of skills that few other candidates are likely to possess, anticipate that the company will be more likely to hire someone who is able to respond to an interview request and start work immediately.if you do not already live in the immediate area of the job s location, plan your move as soon as possible. research the availability of residences and the logistics of moving there before submitting your application. at the same time, set aside a separate budget for travel in order to appear promptly for an in person interview if required.   if you plan to move to the company s location before applying or being hired, be sure to secure employment with another company until disney guarantees you a job. due to its popularity, disney may receive countless applications for each opening, creating stiff competition for you. also be sure to have your own means of transportation, whether it be a car or bike, since many disney companies are located in cities without reliable bus or train service.    the more specialized and or behind the scenes your position is, the less you may have to worry about this, but remember that disney is a family oriented business. tailor your appearance accordingly. style your hair conservatively. refrain from getting visible or offensive tattoos. dress professionally for interviews and leave the body jewelry at home.again, there are many different disney companies, with each one offering many different positions, so dress codes and professional appearance may be more relaxed in some areas, but err on the side of caution until the job is definitely yours. also be sure to keep your record squeaky clean, since disney retains the right to perform background and criminal checks on its employees at any given time.

query	QALD2_tr-31	call the czech republic from the united states  if you re calling the czech republic from the united states, don t forget to take the language difference into account. czech is the only official language, although a minority may also speak english, german, italian, french or spanish. you must also take the time difference into account  the czech republic observes summer time, but on a slightly different schedule than the united states  daylight saving time.  steps dial 011, the exit code that signals you re about to make an international call. dial 420, the country code for the czech republic. dial the 1  to 3 digit area city code. dial the rest of the telephone number.    exit codes vary depending on which country you re dialing out from. although 011 is the exit code for the united states, canada and a few other countries, 00 is the most common exit code in europe.      the country code remains the same, no matter where you re dialing from. czechoslovakia used to have the country code 42. when the country split into the czech republic and slovak republic, the country code was divided  420 for the czech republic and 421 for the slovak republic.    leave off the leading zero, if any.   all czech cellular phones have a 3 digit prefix, which begins with a 6 or 7. the prefix identifies the cell phone provider  usually either t mobile, vodafone or o2.    non emergency and non information czech numbers total 9 digits.  
query	QALD2_tr-32	eat in paris on the cheap  when you re visiting the  city of lights,  you will want to take advantage of all that this european landmark has to offer but you might not have an endless budget. a large part of controlling costs when you re strolling through the streets of paris is being able to recognize bargains on meals and how to keep your food expenses low. without a little knowledge about how food is bought and sold in this big city, you could end up paying quite a bit more for your daily bread than you wanted. here are some simple steps that will help you eat in paris on the cheap and save more money for other expenses.  steps learn a bit of french. figure out euro exchange rates. know your arrondissement. skip the sit down. find  value foods.  go to local food markets.  this may seem daunting, but the alternative mumbling apologetically to shopkeepers and other locals leaves a lot to be desired. even a few choice words can help you navigate menus better, or at least realize when you re getting fleeced.    the euro is the central currency of the european union, and france now uses this currency almost exclusively for everything that gets bought and sold throughout the average day. know how your currency stacks up to the euro in order to avoid paying more than you thought.    every neighborhood of paris has its own unique qualities. some tend to have more affordable food, and others are tourist traps. get acquainted with the areas you re visiting in order to find the cheapest food opportunities.    just as in most countries, meals are much more expensive when you are served at a table. getting order out food doesn t mean you have to buy less quality, it just means you don t pay extra to be waited on. plus, in some parisian venues, you can get some nasty recriminations just for looking at a waiter the wrong way. for more value, use the sit down option sparingly.    experienced travelers know about some of the readily accessible food options across paris that come with a lower price tag. some of these, like crepes and falafel sandwiches, are easy to make and sell, and therefore, you will pay a lot less for them than for some other kinds of meals.    these open air or centrally housed markets are where many locals shop, and you can find fresh, affordable food. again, it helps to know the language in order to barter with individual sellers.

several guides to get you started.useful phrases to use include basic, polite greetings such as please and thank you, asking for objects, and asking for directions.the strongest english speakers are

device, such as imiwa, which lets you look up words by pronunciation, and yomiwa, which translates language characters captured in your photos, can help you even after you arrive in japan.    some travel maps have location names printed side by side in japanese and english or another foreign language. this way, you have the translations of places in case you need to speak to a japanese native

offer guidance.    japanese is made of three writing systems  hiragana and katakana, which are simplified phonetic alphabets for local and foreign words respectively, and kanji, which consists of over 40,000 symbols. this makes up much of japanese communication, so it helps to have translation on hand.if you ll have a device with internet access on your trip, visit a site such as jisho.org where

of issues such as celiac disease, vegetarianism, halal, and kosher food, but there remains the need for many changes in order to accommodate all travelers. allow places weeks or months to prepare to accommodate your needs.places better accustomed to handling tourists are better equipped to meet these needs. this includes larger hotels and nearby restaurants. consumers looking for halal and kosher food in particular must keep in mind that even restaurants that advertise these specialties can still violate religious laws out of a lack of exposure to such cultures. print out a card with your

be safe, master a basic bow in a mirror or around friends.a standard bow is appropriate in many situations for travelers, including when you greet or part from someone. the only exception is when you are greeted by a clerk or attendant upon entering a store, as most people pass with a nod of acknowledgement. when offering thanks or apologies for disturbing someone, such as when asking for directions, be sure to offer this bow of courtesy.to ensure you avoid offense, return a bow when anyone bows to you. it s better to be safe than sorry. keep your spine in a straight line as you bend from your hips. don t move your legs, hips, or your butt. keep your arms straight and your hands against your sides. incline your body downwards to a 30 45 degree angle. standing straight means your

couple hundred yen and can be purchased at the subway s vending machines.    buses are an easy choice in most countries for fast transportation, but in japan they fill the niche between convenient trains and crowded streets. travel takes longer but is several hundred yen cheaper than by train.   check online at kakuyasubus.jp and other sites. there you can find buses and reserve seats.highway buses and night buses are similar to tour buses in other countries. they come equipped with bathrooms and will transport you between cities. local buses are necessary in locations without subways. these will have timetables and routes at bus stops.    taxis are a safe, easy way to get around busy cities. the costs can add up, but if you pay for a taxi you won t have to worry about subway lines and walking directions.taxis start at several hundred yen and the cost per distance rises the further you travel. taxis can be found either by waiting at a taxi stand or flagging one down. vacant taxis have a red light atop the dashboard. occupied ones have a green light. the driver may not speak your language, so it is useful to have on hand a map or a japanese printout of your address.    driving in japan can be difficult. it may mean getting accustomed to driving on the left side of the road, an abundance of traffic, and pricey gasoline. having your own transportation can also be freeing.you ll need to be at least 18 with a valid driver s license in your home country and an international driving permit, but many rental companies only do business with those over 21.inquire with your local government on how to apply for an international driving permit. in america, for example, requirements includes two passport pictures, a valid u.s. driver s license, and a permit fee.be wary of scams. in america, for instance, only the american automobile association and american automobile touring association are licensed to take applications for international driving permits.visit tocoo  car rental s website  www2.tocoo.jp . they hold information on hundreds of rental agencies, cars, and traffic signs. call rental car agencies. agencies such as toyota rent a car, nippon rent a car, and nissan rent a car have phone lines in addition to websites you can visit for help. road signs on major highways contain both japanese and english text. for other locations, try a bilingual map.    the best location for this depends upon your home currency, but knowing where to go when you need yen is essential in a cash based society such as japan. cards are growing in popularity, but smaller shops favor cash transactions.for a currency that is valuable in japan such as american dollars or when the yen is weak, you may get a better rate exchanging your currency when you arrive.airport exchange counters, banks, and post offices are good places to exchange your currency. bring a conversion calculator, too. this can be a handheld calculator after you ve learned of the exchange rate, an online website if you ll have internet access, or a phone application such as xe currency.    you don t want to be caught in japan needing to withdraw money but finding out the atm doesn t accept your card. ask your bank if your card works in japan and for alternatives.    once you are settled with your bank, it s a good idea to familiarize yourself with where you can find places to access your money. many atms, particularly those beyond typical tourist locations, will be harder to manage for those that don t speak japanese.   banks, post offices, and large hotels are tourist friendly and often have atms. another good location to find atms is 7 11. japan has tens of thousand branches of this convenient store chain and they re friendly to tourists.    pasmo, suica, and icoca cards are cards you can preload with yen. this reduces the amount of cash you have to juggle and reduces the need for you to search out atms and use your bank card.   prepaid cards can be found at exchange machines in airports and train stations.a main use for these cards is for managing multiple trips on short distance subways and trains, saving time and hassle during transfers. these cards are now accepted by many stores and vending machines.    rooms in japan fill up fast and the polite culture means that your japanese hosts appreciate ample time to accommodate you. once you ve done this, you ll no longer have to worry about finding a place to stay.  ryokans are japanese style inns. think of the kind of home you may have seen on tv  a serene environment, tatami mats, paper doors, and futons. these are for people who wish to experience traditional japanese culture.some ryokans boast specialties, including relaxing hot springs or an emphasis on japanese food.most offer two meals per person per day. these are traditional, so they may be without central heating, advanced technology, or staff fluent in foreign languages. costs range from a couple thousand yen to over a hundred thousand yen a night. bring cash to pay your bill or check to see if the ryokan accepts credit card.    various international and japanese chains exist, especially among the major cities. these are convenient and offer the usual amenities such as carpeted rooms and televisions.   cost can be an issue. many hotels surround popular attractions where business owners can get away with charging more for goods and services by appealing to tourists. capsule hotels are another option. in the vein of regular hotels, they target mostly single males and offer basics such as a place to sleep, a clean bathroom, and a television at a reduced price.  many people conflate these guest, or gaijin, houses with ryokans. a guest house is an apartment you can rent cheaply for a short contract or a long stay. often this means having to share a kitchen and bathroom with other guests. this is good for experiencing everyday life in japan.   guest houses tend to run under 100,000 yen for a month s stay.  a growing trend worldwide is to house visitors in one s own house or apartment and japan is no different. search online for renting rates, locations, and modern and restored traditional houses that will allow you to experience life in japan through the eyes of a native.  these are for budget and often younger travelers. they operate much as dormitories do and include shared rooms and common areas. this is an ideal place if you wish to interact with a wide variety of travelers.hostels tend to cost under 5,000 yen. many hostels have extra benefits, including a guest kitchen, meals, and free internet. check with the hostel for any fees associated with these features. some hostels, especially those outside big cities, have strict curfews and lock out periods where you need to be away from your room.    many places, including hostels and hotels, can be booked online or over the telephone. if you ve yet to figure out where you re going to stay, a travel agency can guide you. either describe where you d like to stay or ask for their opinion. this can be the only way to reach out to traditional ryokans, as some are not technologically advanced.    japan still maintains a culture of formality. casual clothing is fine for walking around and seeing the sights, but to dress like the locals, lean towards the formal. no matter the ages of yourself and anyone you are traveling with, avoid clothes that are tattered, ragged, or revealing.   inside establishments, choose formal wear such as a suit or jacket for men and a skirt and high heels for women.avoid jeans. you ll see natives wearing jeans on occasion, but most people wear more formal pants, skirts, and even shorts on the street. children and young adults also benefit from avoiding the attention jeans bring. jeans and shorts should not be worn inside restaurants.    the japanese choose muted, traditional colors including black, blue, brown, gray, and white. the goal is to not stand out in a crowd and most japanese choose to avoid gaudiness.   men should also avoid black ties and women all black, since this is associated with funerals. children and teenagers have more leeway, but still it is best to avoid clothing that is flashy, over the top, or revealing.    the winter months are december through february, but the cold lasts until may. the weather trends towards 5 10 degrees celsius and 40 50 degrees farenheit, accompanied by harsh, cold wind.bring gloves, a scarf, a knit hat, and warm underwear.    this is essential in the rainy season, which occurs around the month of june, but a light raincoat is always useful in fending off japan s rains. you may also bring an umbrella or shop for these once you arrive.    the summer months are june through august when the weather becomes hot and humid. you will sweat a lot, so bring quick drying fabrics such as linen and cotton.   women of all ages have to take care to stay covered, as japan has a culture of modesty. slender legs can be passable, but avoid cleavage and bare midriffs at all costs.consider bringing a light jacket or sweater in case the air conditioning inside establishments makes you cold.    this depends on where you re going. you ll need a bathing suit for the beach, but most hot springs  onsen  restrict bathing suits as they pollute the water. rather, you are meant to clean yourself, then wear a towel and set it aside upon entering the water.women and girls should choose a one piece bathing suit. japan s modest culture leads many to frown upon excessive skin exposure of a bikini.    this isn t mandatory, but many places in japan, including restaurants and ryokans, maintain a custom of not bringing shoes inside. if you don t want to go through the effort of undoing laces, alternative shoes are important.remember that tatami mats are a clear indicator to take off your shoes.    japan has different customs regarding medications and it ll benefit you to have whatever you need on hand since you won t be able to buy most of what you need without a japanese prescription. this is also useful in case your departure get delayed.   again, check local laws with an embassy and discuss alternatives with your doctor if the medication you need isn t permitted inside japan.    there is nothing like traveling to a foreign country and discovering you can t charge your important devices because the outlets are different. if you live outside north america, invest in one before you leave.japan uses two pronged plugs with similar voltage to north america customs, so the only type of conversion needed for north americans is for devices with more prongs,    while in japan, you ll notice that many natives rinse their hands with a little water after using the bathroom. many public bathrooms do not offer soap or paper towels.  since you ll likely want to use your electronic device for internet contact, searching for information on japan, and translation, you ll need wi fi access. you can rent these from places online such as econnect and japan rail pass.com.   a portable hotspot establishes a portal for your devices to connect to the internet, but a sim card is a chip you install in your phone to enable it to connect to the internet. these devices should be reserved in advance and delivered to a convenient location upon your arrival, such as the airport post office and your hotel. the sim card requires a existing internet connection to register, so do this in a public place such as the airport. when you re finished with the device, all you have to do is put it in an included pre paid package and drop it in a postbox.  this is another option for wi fi connectivity. you can also find these at econnect and japan rail pass.com, among other sites. these cards allow you to connect to the internet even when you re away a wi fi hotspot.    some carriers offer roaming services, but others don t operate in japan at all. if you haven t done this yet, you ll want to check so that you can plan on obtaining a device such as a sim card or locating hotspots.    this will help you in a pinch if you don t have an alternative method such as pocket wi fi. due to the growth of technology, public internet access is growing in japan, but you should still check to see where you can connect.most big tourist areas, including hotels, train lines, and shopping districts now have free wi fi access.    you don t have to go overboard planning your trip to the last detail. in fact, you may not even see all the places you consider here. still, it s good to have some idea so you can plan out issues such as wi fi access, printing location names in japanese, money management, and traveling.   as there are plenty of sights for younger and older adults, there are plenty of attractions that cater to children. you ll find no shortage of zoos, museums, nature, and amusement parks with no fear that the japanese will be anything less than welcoming.  comparing the prices you are familiar with to yen prices requires an adjustment. before you go, decide on how much you plan to spend and where you intend to spend it. this will remove a lot of the stress you d get from navigating a foreign country.    most visitors can get around fine in japan on their own, but don t be afraid to hire a guide if needed. search online or contact an agency for representatives willing to show you to where you d like to go while providing insight on japan along the way.   this can be particularly useful for travelers searching for restaurants based on dietary restrictions. the travel industry for muslims has been growing, for instance, so a tour from a specialized company can help you navigate japan and locate halal friendly restaurants.    japan is a popular tourist spot, so other travelers before you have begun to influence food culture and assemble lists of restaurants that cater to dietary restrictions. search for vegetarian restaurants in tokyo, for example, to find these lists online and plan out your diet.a tour guide or specialized visitor representatives and hotel staffs can help guide you to restaurants that fit your needs.    if you intend on making purchases in japan, you may need to send them home via shipping. airlines have strict regulations these days, but parcel companies can ensure packages reach your door.   one such resource is the ta q bin system  kuronekoyamato.co.jp , which also has information on international moving and ups services.

query	QALD2_tr-41	watch football  soccer   soccer is  the world s game,  and the men s world cup is the most watched program on earth.   1    yet, despite these accolades, many people still find it very difficult to watch and enjoy soccer. part of this stems from a lack of understanding, and partly this is from the perceived  uneventful  nature of soccer compared to other sports. that said,  the beautiful game  is accessible to everyone, and the drama, intrigue, and excitement doesn t just come from goals. you just need to know where to look for it.  understanding the rules appreciating the game finding great games understand the basic structure of the game. know that the clock counts up to 90 minutes, not down to zero. know the parts of the soccer field. learn how to judge what is and is not a foul. understand the offside rule. know that most infractions are restarted with a free kick. understand the yellow and red cards are given for serious fouls infractions. revel in the flow of

tournaments. follow soccer blogs, teams, and accounts to be in the know about upcoming games.  soccer is a relatively simple game, rules wise. the objective is to score more goals than the other team by putting the ball in their net. each team has 11 players working together to move the ball and defend against attacks, but they cannot use their arms or hands to do so. the key rules to know include    each team has one goalie, who is allowed to use his her hands to defend their goal, but only in the boxes around their goal. a goal is scored when the entire ball crosses the entire goal line and is within the frame of the goal. while light contact is accepted, a team of 3 referees is on the field to enforce the rules and make sure the players are attempting to attack the ball, not the other team.    one of the first things that confuses new soccer watchers is the clock. unlike most other sports, the clock doesn t count down to zero, it counts up to 90 00. the game is broken into two even 45 minute halves with a 10 15 minute break in the middle. the clock also never stops, and the game only ends with the referee blows the final whistle  usually 2 3 times in a row .   this is so the game doesn t stop unexpectedly. soccer is all about flow, and if the clock was being constantly stopped, started, and checked like in football basketball then the game would take forever. the game doesn t stop right at the 45  or 90  mark. rather, the referee adds  stoppage time  to account for when the ball was out of bounds, a goal was scored, subs were made, etc. this means the actual game might stop at the 93 minute mark. most tv broadcasts will show you how many extra minutes are being added in the corner of the screen as halftime or the end approaches.    a soccer pitch is a simple rectangle. there are a few extra marks, but the essential ones are all intuitive and easy to read.    the center circle is where play begins. the ball is placed in the center middle of the field and the starting team gets to pass it. the other team cannot enter the circle until the ball has been touched.  the goal box also known as the penalty box or the 18 yard box, this is the rectangle on either end of the field in front of the goals. the goalie can only use their hands in this area.  the touch lines are the long sides of the field. if the ball crosses over this line completely than the last team to touch the ball gives it to the other team for a throw in.  the goal lines the two end lines of the field. if the ball crosses this line and is within the fame of the goal, it is a goal. if it crosses the line, but not in the goal, then it is a goal kick or corner kick, depending on who touched the ball last.    a foul is when a player makes illegal contact with another player on the other team by hitting, tripping, or kicking them. however, there is a lot of physical contact that is never called. figuring out what is a foul and what isn t is one of the most difficult exercises in soccer, because there are few clear cut  infractions  to call like in football or basketball. the best way to remember a foul is to ask yourself    did the player  play the ball,  meaning did they make contact with the ball, or did they  play the player,  by pushing hitting tripping the other player to win possession  fifa defines the type of fouls as    kicking, or attempting to kick, the other player. tripping, or attempting jumping charging at someone striking, or attempting punching, or attempting tackling spitting holding. handling the ball.  this rule gives a lot of people consternation, but it is actually pretty straightforward. it simply states that a player cannot receive the ball from a teammate if they are behind the last defender. it is easiest to see with an example     usa attacker alex morgan runs past the defender, leaving just her and the goalie between herself and the goal. alex s teammate megan rapinoe who is in front of the defender alex just ran by, passes alex the ball. alex is offside, and the referee blows the whistle to stop the game. this rule is only complicated because of the speed of play, and several important tweaks to the rule. still, they are straightforward   if alex does not touch or play the ball,  but is still in an offside position, she is not offside.  if megan passes the ball, and alex runs into an offside position to get it, she is not offside.  what matters is where she is when the ball is passed, not where she gets it. if alex and megan are on their defensive half of the field, then they cannot ever be offside.  you can be offside on a shot or missed pass, too, if you get the ball before anyone else touches it. you cannot be offside if the other team passes or shoots the ball.  if there is a foul or someone is offside, then play is restarted by a free kick awarded to the opposite team. no person on the other team can be within 10 yards of the ball before it is kicked, at which point normal play resumes.   if the ball goes out over the sides of the field it is restarted by a throw in, which must be done with both hands, over the head. if an attacker misses the goal and it crosses the end line, the goalie gets a free kick from their goal. if a defender kicks the ball out over their own end line the offensive team gets a free kick from the corner of the field.  a yellow card is basically a warning, telling the player that their foul was careless, reckless, or excessive. a red card is far more serious, as it means the player is immediately ejected from the game and their team is forced to play with one less player for the rest of the game.   two yellow cards in the same game, for the same player, always leads to an automatic red card. some infractions, like violent play, intentionally fouling or using your hand to stop and obvious goal, and swearing or threatening the referee, are automatic red cards.  soccer is not high scoring, but that doesn t mean it isn t exciting. soccer is about flow, the give and take between teams as they try to figure each other out and attack weak spots while simultaneously defending their own. soccer is much more about tension and rapid, sudden changes of pace and momentum then constant scoring. goals are incredibly difficult to score, making each one a huge, special moment many minutes in the making.   consider goals the culmination of a long attack    like a battle being fought and contested in the trenches before one side makes big, successful push. the more you understand about soccer, the more enjoyable it becomes beyond just flashy goals. soccer is too organic, creative, and fluid to be broken down into individual plays.    a soccer game consists of hundreds of small challenges and individual battles. it could be a wing player attempting to slice and dice a defender or a striker jockeying to win a header in the box. these individual battles, more often than not, determine the entire game. an attacker, for example, could be barely getting by his defender before getting tackled. but if you notice him her getting more and more shots off as the game continues, you can tell he s beginning to get the upper hand. all it takes is one goal for the battle, and the game, to be decided.    how do the individual players move, attack, and defend to aid their team. what are they doing when they don t have the ball  this is where games are won and lost, because all 11 players need to be working together no matter where the ball is.    defenders. do they give the other team space, or follow them everywhere  do they stay close to home, or do they roam up on attack  a fast and attacking defender like philip lahm or deandre yedlin is often the most exciting player on the field, winning a tackle and then taking the ball right back up the field on an attack. weaker teams or defenders give the offense lots of time and space, waiting for a 2nd defender to join them instead of attacking on their own.  midfielders. what do the players in the middle of the field do  this is where the tempo of the game is dictated, and they are the most important tactical players on the field. are they going out wide or backward a lot  if so, they re likely probing for holes in the defense, sitting back and waiting for chances. midfielders that dribble, attack, and pass forward a lot are trying to push the team forward for a goal, exposing their defenses by pressuring the other team to respond quickly to their attacks.  attacker striker. are they checking backward often, getting the ball and passing it quickly  are they holding far up the field, using size and speed to get the ball, turn and shoot  are they running onto passes often then putting moves and tricks on defenders to win space  an attacker is there to create havoc for the defenders, even when they don t have the ball, and these match ups are often the most crucial.    managing the field on the fly is the secret weapon of a good soccer team. passing is not always used directly to attack the goal. rather, it is used to force the other team to move, shift, and adapt, potentially making a mistake and leaving a hole open. the basic tenet of soccer tactics is manipulating the other team to give you space in front of the goal for a shot when you re attacking, or closing down space so that they other team can t move forward when playing defense.   notice how many balls are played to players on the run. this is because they are running into open space. they need to get the ball before a defender joins them and closes down the opening. is a team  bunkering in  by placing all of their defenders near their goal  this is used to prevent goals, especially if they have a lead. it can, however, lead to lots of free shots from farther out which will crack the facade of a defending team. watch the defense of a great team, like italy, to see how a team masterfully controls space. you ll notice that they move as one consistent line, eliminating pockets of space in front of and behind them as a unit.    much like defensive patterns in football, soccer teams have general patterns for their players that greatly impact their style of play. formations are always written from the back upwards, excluding the goalkeeper. so a 4 4 2 would mean there are 4 defenders, 4 midfielders, and 2 attackers strikers.   the  classic  formation, a 4 4 2 is a solid, well rounded strategy that has been used for decades. that said, it lacks in creativity and is often used for defensive or counterattack oriented teams. a team s formation says a lot about their strategy going forward. do they have 1 striker and a big midfield  if so, they re likely looking to control the center of the field and run players up into space on the wings. are they sitting back with 5 defenders  where players are placed tells you how the team wants to attack and defend.    your appreciation of soccer will shoot up incredibly once you notice not only what teams or players are doing, but why. how do the tactics, match ups, and pace of play come together in a good team  how are they attacking  along the sides of the field a lot, through the middle, by hitting big huge crosses up the field   and how successful are they  do all of their passes go through one player, or is everyone on the field touching the ball    it can help to watch how the best teams in the world play a cohesive, recognizable game. brazil is known for flash, talent, and speed. italy is known for slower play and stalwart defense. the usa is a quick, counterattacking team that tries to make the most of it s limited chances against better teams with lightening fast attacks. if you watch a lot of american sports, think about each attack like a play in football. whereas a one football team might focus on the passing game to be effective and another the running, a soccer team might rely on the wings  sides  to attack defenders and put crosses into the box or a few big players to muscle out and attack up the middle. the only difference is that soccer plays are fluid and organic, not chosen ever 15 seconds, so strategies are constantly evolving.    they are beautiful contests marked by near misses, technical brilliance, passionate players, and non stop, commercial free push and pull. tactics and substitutions are dissected with chess like precision, good teams fail to find the goal when they should have 5 goals already, and underdogs can sneak a goal in even after 85 minutes of constant pressure. soccer is about 2 3 large climaxes in the midst of an intense game, not constant scoring, and is best enjoyed as such.  the best way to catch the soccer bug is to be in the stands. you can feel the collective rise and falls of emotion from your fellow fans, see both team s tactic happening across the entire team, and you ll learn a few colorful chants in the process. like most sports, soccer is best enjoyed in person, when you can really get swept up into the game.    soccer is on year round, as there are so many different leagues, tournaments, and teams across the world that you can almost always be sure of finding a game. while the availability of certain games depends on where you live and your tv provider, following your favorite teams is getting easier and easier in the online era. moreover, the widespread nature of soccer means that almost every country and area will have a team to watch.   if you want to watch a game, but can t find it on tv, search for the game and date, plus the word  streaming  in your internet browser. many soccer blogs will post all of the different ways to see the game. check out your local teams, including semi pro teams. much like baseball, soccer players and teams can move up and down in the rankings from season to season and even become national stars after several years. the rankings and leagues are fluid, and the enormous global market means players move frequently.    just about every country on the planet has a soccer league, and while most of them play through the winter months, many of them are staggered in order to make room for international tournaments later in the year. these teams are colloquially known as  clubs.     the english premier league, generally considered the best league in the world, plays from late august to early may. la liga  spain , seria a  italy , bundesliga  germany , and ligue 1  france , the other major european leagues, all run on similar timelines.  major league soccer, america s league, runs from march to october. liga mx, the mexican league, runs in both the summer and winter.    all sports are more fun if you have someone to root for. pick a team or league based on whatever feels right to you, whether it is your hometown,

best players go because it has the most money. the play is crisp, tactical, and fast, and there are a lot of teams that can compete in any given game.  la liga, the spanish league, is fast and flashy. the players are technical and the game is beautiful, and the top clubs, like barcelona and real madrid, are among the best in the world every single year.  the bundesliga, germany s league, is technical and physical, and produces many of the best players in the world. it is less watched, perhaps, than other leagues in europe, but contains some of the highest quality play.the mls is a young, quickly growing league marked by physicality and young, developing players.    almost every league in the world doesn t actually have a playoff. instead, points are tallied up from every game, and the highest point total wins the league. however, there are a variety of major tournaments each year for club teams, and this is almost always the highest quality soccer you can watch every year.   the champions league is a tournament between all of the best clubs from every country in europe. qualifying takes place over the summer and winter, with the final in may.the fa cup is a tournament between every pro or semi pro team in england, no matter what their standing is. every continent has versions of this cup  such as south america s copa libertadores  but the european league is the best known tournament.    a country s national team is made up of only citizens of that country, and these teams compete in the world s biggest tournaments, like the world cup. international soccer is played in the summer and consists of a series of games, qualifications, and tournaments that ultimately culminate in the world cup every 4 years.    friendlies are practice games that mean little, but are essential for team building and testing out players and strategies. since most players leave to play for their club team during the year, these are crucial practice games for coaches.  qualification for major tournaments, such as the gold cup, the world cup, and the confederations cup, take place every single year. these crucial games determine, ultimately, what 32 countries make it to the world cup.  tournaments these round robin and knock out events are what every national team lives for. winning some of them, like the gold cup, gets you an automatic free bid to the world cup, the ultimate tournament in soccer.  there is so much soccer on tv at any given time, it is hard not to find something worth watching. but the deluge of information can be overwhelming, especially for new fans. if you don t have a team or can t figure out who to watch, the best place to start is the english premier league. it runs from august to may, and all of the games are played on saturday and sunday, always, making it easy to sit down and get a good game even if you aren t in the know about the schedules.

martial arts, bodybuilding, and other types of training. he used barbells, kettle balls and circuit training regimens on different days of the week. lee believed in organizing workouts by similarities  he would train differently on each day. for example, some days would be devoted to punching, and some devoted to kicking.it s said that he could hold a barbell that weighed 40 kilograms  88 pounds   for 40 seconds at arm s length and that he could punch his finger through a closed can of soda. he could swap a coin in your hand before you had time to close it.    bruce lee was not a person who found a single workout to stick with forever. he was constantly changing his workouts and trying new things to push his body to every limit and to prevent his body from being able to adapt.   he ran, rode bikes, and jumped rope as well as practiced kicking and punching. in other words, he was interested in all around training. bruce lee was an all around athlete with an extremely defined body and an incredibly impressive combination of speed and strength. lee did enjoy martial arts, but he didn t want his body to get too used to any fitness regimen. check your ego at the door. the goal of lee s training was not to physically look great. he wanted a functional body and described training as  the art of expressing the human body.     although bruce lee practiced many different physical fitness regimens, he is clearly defined in part by his ability to excel at martial arts. to some degree, he used other fitness styles in order to become a better martial artist.   he started learning the wing chun style of kung fu from a grandmaster and then he formed his own method, jeet june do, which was not bound by rigid rules. lee defined this as  a style without a style,  meaning the fighter was open to fight in whichever way he or she thought would be effective. he practiced martial arts rigorously though so that he had all kicks and punches at his disposal if needed. some martial arts studios in your area might use the bruce lee style of fighting.    lee put a lot of emphasis on training the muscles in the forearms, which he felt were extremely important for any martial artist. it was by no means the only training he focused on, but he considered it important.   lee would hit heavy bags as aggressively as he could. he was always on the move, side stepping and feinting, even when hitting a bag, because he believed you shouldn t leave yourself open to attack. he used jabs, crosses and hooks when punching. he felt the feet were also incredibly important, and that it was important to be able to move fast and lightly with them. he used side kicks, hook kicks, spin kicks, rear and front thrusts, and heel kicks when training.    bruce lee knew that martial artists also needed to build their strength. he was one of the visionaries who first made this connection.   thus, he worked on developing his arm and leg strength with weight training. he didn t only punch and kick bags. he used weights in his workouts. lee would use kettle balls and barbells to do squats, pullovers, and bench presses. he is known for his extremely well defined muscles, as his

time and would try to do this for three days a week.    lee felt that the abdominal muscles were really important to an elite martial artist because they enabled the martial artist to withstand even the hardest punches.   lee s famous six pack abs were not about looking great. they were about creating a shield that could ward off tough punches from opponents. in order to strengthen his abdominal muscles, lee would have a person drop a medicine ball on his stomach, while he was lying on the ground. be careful with this maneuver if you are not already in impeccable shape so you don t get hurt. side bends, leg raises and sit ups were some of the ways that lee worked his abs. he would usually do 5 sets to failure.    one of the most famous quotes often attributed to bruce lee is  absorb what

used this ability to focus to his advantage while fighting, but he employed discipline and focus through all aspects of his life. while being focused on the task at hand, lee was extremely open to experimentation. he was focused on achieving top physical and mental fitness, but he did so with a wide range of activities and ideas.bruce lee was extremely disciplined. be unpredictable when fighting, though. bruce lee had a legendary style of fighting that relied on what was called  the way of the intercepting fist.  that meant that he was an unpredictable fighter who altered his strikes depending on his opponent s incoming attack. he was entertaining because he was not predictable.    bruce lee believed in internal balance. he was interested in wu wei, which is a term in taoist philosophy that means  not doing. the goal of wu wei is to only undertake natural action, and to, thus, allow things to come easily or naturally, rather than partaking in activities that involve struggle or extreme effort.a lot of people misunderstand wu wei. to practice it, clear your mind and get in the flow. wu wei does not mean laziness. it means not overthinking things and making them more difficult than they need to be. bruce lee was known for his metaphysical wisdom.he once wrote that wu wei was  not being without emotion or feeling, but being one in whom feeling was not sticky or blocked. therefore in order to control myself, i must first accept myself by going with and not against my nature.     in order to be like bruce lee, you should exercise the mind, not just the

yet it is not divided.   bruce lee didn t back down from what he believed in. primarily, this was because, above all, bruce lee believed in himself. he had the confidence to set his own path in life.   don t confuse that with arrogance. he had enough humility to know that he, himself, did not hold all of the answers, so he turned to many other teachers and disciplines in his quest to find them. he mastered his own mind and body, taught himself everything he wanted to, and loved himself for it. so you need to know what you want to do in your life, start doing it now, and believe in yourself  one way to describe bruce lee accurately is to say that he was a knowledge seeker. he had an unquenchable thirst for self improvement, both physical and of the mind. lee didn t let oppression hold him back. he shattered cultural barriers and fought back against those who would hold him back.    bruce lee knew that total fitness excellence must also include eating right. he had a list of banned foods that he never touched, and he enjoyed protein rich drinks. he didn t put anything in his body that he considered empty calories.   lee was trying to gain weight in muscle, and he went from 100 to 130 pounds. he made weight gain shakes that mixed powdered milk with things like royal jelly, vitamins, and ginseng. lee wouldn t eat baked goods or things made with refined flour because he didn t think they added anything important to the body. lee did not eat food he thought could harm his body. he didn t drink coffee, choosing tea instead. he enjoyed chinese food, though. he was not a vegetarian or vegan and enjoyed eating meat, but the chinese dishes he ate most were vegetable heavy.in contrast to some modern diets which have turned carbohydrates into the enemy, lee tried to eat carbs because he thought they were needed to maintain such a high level pf physical activity. thus, he would eat them in 4 5 small meals a day. he liked chinese food because of its emphasis on vegetables and rice versus proteins and fats.    to really be like bruce lee, you have to turn fitness into a livelihood. it wasn t something that he just did once and a while. it was a lifestyle to him. it was something he did every second of every day.   it would be difficult to be completely like bruce lee, in part because his level of devotion to fitness was almost unparalleled and because it takes so much time. many people are too busy to basically make fitness their careers. however, you could still engage in training that is inspired by his general philosophies. the key is to go for a full body workout by mixing up your routines, and to do it consistently, even if, for you, that means several days a week. to really be like bruce lee though, fitness needs to permeate almost

query	QALD2_tr-6	make an abraham lincoln costume  abraham lincoln was the 16th president of the united states of america. he is considered to be one of the most famous and admired figures in us history.   1    like some of history s most influential figures, lincoln had a very distinctive look. his bearded chin, style of dress and polite manner of speaking are all instantly recognizable to anyone with a working knowledge of history. if you want to play the role of one of the greatest leaders in american history, you ll have to take the man s character into account as well as the clothes he wore. luckily, there is a huge amount of information available about the man, so you won t need to look far to get a costume started.  dressing like abraham lincoln doing lincoln hair and makeup

civility and politeness. approximate lincoln s accent. talk using a tenor voice. watch the movie lincoln.  lincoln may have had a lot of folk sense in him, but he never turned down an opportunity to look civilized and classy. his dress of choice was always a black overcoat. so long as the coat doesn t have any visible logos or symbols, you can use any black overcoat for this.look at existing lincoln costumes or pictures of the man himself and decide if any coat you have fits the bill.   a grey vest underneath may help to round off your costume.however, if you can t find one of those, a white dress shirt will do. you may also choose to button up your overcoat.    top hats can be found at costume or consignment stores, or made by rolling black felt and gluing on a rim. provided you re aiming for a traditional lincoln costume, you should keep the hat black. top hats often come with pre fabricated lincoln costumes.if you can t find a top hat, make your own. roll black construction paper into a tube. stand it up on another sheet of black construction paper, and trace the circle around the bottom  use a pencil so the silvery graphite will show up . fold the paper in half so that the circle is exactly in half, cut out the circle, and cut a second circle out around the edge, so that you end up with a brim for your top hat. tape it to the black tube.    although they won t attract as much attention as your coat or top hat, it s nonetheless a good idea to round off your costume with a good set of black shoes. the most important thing is that your shoes are black  this way they won t conflict with the rest of the costume. shoes with a buckle are rarer today than they were then, but they also match the costume if you have them lying around.   lincoln wore size 14 shoes. lincoln s father was a shoemaker.  they are not commonly worn in fashion today but you can usually find them for sale at department stores and costume shops. bowties don t need to be done up perfectly. rather, an imperfect bowtie will give your costume that much more character. lincolns bowties were obviously hand tied, but pre tied bowties are available as well if you don t want to bother with the tying process.to hand tie a bowtie, loop the bowtie around your neck, leaving a few inches more on one side. draw the longer end under the other side of your tie and loop it through the center, tightening it as you go along. bring the longer end of the bowtie over the other end and pinch them in the middle, looping the longer end through a hole at the back. tighten it gently.  lincoln s beard was arguably his most distinctive attribute. his beard was based around the chin and allowed to grow quite bushy, without hiding his shirt collar.look at pictures of lincoln s beard and groom your facial hair to match this. you can also make a fake beard with construction paper or brown felt. use spirit gum to attach it to your face.   although he s remembered for his beard, there were points in his life where abraham lincoln shaved his beard. a woman named grace bedell convinced him to grow it out. this had the effect of making lincoln look more trustworthy and warm.  eyebrows are a distinctive trait of lincoln s.although not quite as iconic as the beard, they should be considered if you want to make a convincing lincoln costume. either purchase some fake eyebrows from a costume store, or make some of your own by gluing pipe cleaner onto thin strips of brown construction paper. from there, you can glue them to your face using spirit gum.    lincoln had a very striking face, with sunken cheeks and protruding cheekbones. one way to replicate this look is by using stage makeup. you should first suck n your cheeks. this way, you ll be able to see where the contours of your face are. next, take a grey or brown stage makeup and apply it to the area that s sucked in. blend the edges with your fingers.   because  gaunt cheek  makeup is usually reserved for horror costumes, it s a good idea to be very moderate with the makeup you use here, provided you re going for a  realistic  lincoln.you can try different variations on makeup to create different looks. a  zombie  abe lincoln can be done by using lots of white with black around the eyes.  lincoln was known for preferring to keep his hair unruly, as opposed to smooth. if your hair length is approximately that of lincoln s, you should tousle it up by rubbing your hands coarsely through it. if your hair is quite long, you can get some of the same untidy impression by trapping all of your hair under your top hat and letting a few strands hang loose.    there are endless creative ways you can spruce up a costume once you have the basics down. because abraham lincoln was a politician, you might consider making a pin that says  vote abraham lincoln  on it and pinning it to your jacket. the real lincoln was also often seen holding pocket watches, so adding one to your costume may be a good idea for the fake of authenticity.   a walking cane is always a good add on to a costume of this nature.    a good costume maker won t be limited to the most obvious costume solutions. in truth, there s a virtually endless amount of ways you can make yourself look like lincoln, without even wearing the proper clothes for it. for instance, you could use paper and black spray painted cardboard cutouts to make the costume s  coat  and  hat,  then tie the pieces around your body. this approach can be called the  paper raham lincoln  costume.   don t underestimate the effect of multiple layers in a fake materials based costume. for instance a  dress shirt  underneath the cardboard coat could be made by cutting out some of the cardboard in the middle and gluing white construction paper    this often takes the form of combining the costume with a skirt and heels in order to feminize it. the  babe raham  lincoln costume is a well known example of this. you can exchange the big coat and pants for a black skirt and blouse. the only part of the original costume you should keep is the hat and chin beard.   the baba raham lincoln costume is a spoof of  sexy  versions of halloween costumes. it can be worn by men and women alike.    because there are countless things you can do with a costume, don t be afraid to splice your abe lincoln design with other costumes. for instance, a cute cat costume can be merged with a lincoln costume by taking the whiskers and ears, and throwing them together with the chin beard and top hat. if you have a stockpile of costume materials, you should experiment with different combinations using what you already have.   you get bonus points if you re able to make abraham lincoln pun from the combination you ve created.    lincoln was no pushover, but all of his recorded speeches make him out to be a very down to earth, respectable and noble minded speaker. if you want to be a great abraham lincoln, you should act with nobility no matter where you are. keep your volume levelled, and don t speak out of turn. however, when you do speak, you should do so with force and conviction. this manner of speaking is a good part    if you want to go the extra mile, try to nail his likely accent. compared to modern accents, lincoln might be pegged somewhere between a kentucky and indiana accent.look up examples of these accents and pick up on the ways in which particular sounds are inflected. contrary to what you d think, many accounts state that lincoln had a soft, light voice,  like a bird .   actors have tried to replicate lincoln s way of speaking. look at a reading of lincoln s speech and get a hang for the way an actor will inflect his voice.  although no recordings of lincoln s speech exist, historians have done research and concluded that lincoln s voice was considerably higher pitched than the usual baritone we hear from politicians.his voice was however not shrill or silly sounding. if you have a naturally deep voice, try to sound a bit higher than you normally would.   edison s first recordings of human speech occurred 12 years after lincoln s death. this makes it anyone s guess what he really sounded like.  steven spielberg s 2012 lincoln biopic has been acclaimed for its historical accuracy.in particular, a lot of attention has been given to how true daniel day lewis  performance is to everything we know of the man. if you want to get lincoln s inflections and personality down, you should watch the film and try to emulate the actor on screen. take care to note the way lincoln talks, as well as the manner in which he moves.   if you were still stumped on certain aspects of your costume you should look at the way the film s costume crew approached lincoln s look.

query	QALD2_tr-74	choose an off season winter travel destination  popular winter travel destinations including ski resorts, winter camping, and scenic vistas can make beautiful and enjoyable trips. however, in order to avoid crowds of tourists and to avoid the expenses associated with winter travel, people sometimes opt instead to visit these winter destinations in the off season  generally from spring through fall  march through october . in order to plan a great off season trip to a winter travel destination, you ll first need to find activities in the area that you can do during spring and summer weather, and make sure that housing options are still available.  deciding on a location for travel traveling to a quiet location without tourists traveling to summer destinations in the winter

and february. anticipate unexpected weather. visit europe in months other than june, july, and august. think in opposites for the southern hemisphere. visit africa during the northern hemisphere s summer.  one of the benefits of traveling in the off season is that hotels and other local forms of accommodation often discount their room rates, in order to attract more travelers during a slower travel period.before you leave on your trip, you ll want to be confirm that none of your prospective accommodations are only seasonally open. some hotels in popular tourist areas may close their doors for the winter.   don t limit yourself to staying in hotels  airbnbs, regular bed and breakfasts, and other forms of accommodation may also offer discounts for off season winter travel.    off season travel also presents opportunities to participate in travel activities that may be overly crowded and filled with tourists during the summer. if you d like to visit popular restaurants, amusement parks, theaters, museums, or shopping districts, the off season is a great time to do so. look online to see if you can find any discounted deals for off season entertainment.a concern with off season travel is that many activities may be open only in the summer for peak tourist season, and may close in the winter. look online for activates that like you d like to do while traveling, and make sure that they haven t closed for the winter.    as part of choosing a travel destination, research transportation options before you go. if you re planning to visit a domestic or international city, look to see what car rental options are available, or if the city infrastructure includes a developed public transit system. if you ll be in a more rural area, check out bus schedules or ride sharing options that may be available.   also look into the effects that the winter weather may have on your travel. you may find that rental companies reduce their scope of operations in off season months. make sure that your planned method of transportation is feasible during the winter, especially with increased season snow and rain. for example, if you re in a country area, renting a car or taking the bus over rural roads may be impossible.  for many, the primary benefit to traveling in the off season especially to destinations frequented in winter is to save money. do plenty of research before finalizing your travel plans  look online  or call  to find hotels that offer off season discounts. also research online to see if travel attractions restaurants, theme parks, museums, theaters offer

weather and high humidity. caribbean travel destinations offer beaches, hiking, resorts, and festivals.the caribbean experiences hurricane season most seriously in august, september, and october, so you may want to avoid those months for weather based reasons. in addition, many hotels and restaurants shut down during the worst weeks of hurricane season. barbados can still draw crowds during

season is also its off season for tourist travel. the region has a lot to offer if you re interested in beach activities despite the cold weather, the beaches will be relatively empty, and present

beach on which to spend your vacation.    many large cities especially those with pleasant summers may be relatively tourist free during the off season winter months. if you re looking to visit a cultural city in a time when it won t be crowded, think about visiting las vegas in the winter. the scorching hot summers will have cooled down, and you ll be able to enjoy your time on the strip and nearby neighborhoods without the level of tourists you d see in summer.   several other cities worth visiting in the winter off season are located in the south  miami, tampa, orlando, atlanta, savannah, etc. southern cities and the south in general will have more temperate weather during the winter.    the british coasts are beautiful  e.g. the cliffs of dover  and crowded during the summer, but host fewer tourists in the winter months. with an off season visit, you can still participate in popular activities such as birdwatching but without the crowds you d find during summer months.as long as you re in britain during the winter, you could expand your travel plans to include destinations including cities like london and liverpool, or travel up into the north of england and scotland. although you may experience cold temperatures in northern regions, you likely will have few other tourists to contend with, and will be able to have a more local, authentic cultural travel experience.    summer specific travel destinations will typically have dramatically different weather during the off season than during tourist season. you ll need to do your research ahead of time, to see if typically warm climates become unbearably cold, snowy, or rainy during the wintry off season.if possible, purchase travel insurance when traveling during off season months. even if weather is routinely hot and pleasant during the winter season, off season travel to the same location could include blizzards, freezing rain, or other unexpected weather. travel insurance will protect belongings that become damaged due to weather. contact your main insurance provider  e.g. your house or car insurance provider  and ask if they provide travel insurance, or can recommend a company which does.    peak tourist season in europe will render popular destinations overcrowded and coincides with unpleasantly warm summer weather. some destinations popularly visited in the winter months especially warmer destinations in southern europe, such as italy, greece, and spain can be equally pleasant in the spring and fall months, when crowds have died down and many hotels offer discounted fares.if you have specific european destinations you d like to visit  e.g. museums, restaurants, vineyards, or historical sites , make sure to check online beforehand to see if the destinations are still open in the off season.  seasons are reversed between the northern and southern hemispheres  summer in the northern occurs during winter in the southern. this means that during the northern off season, you can visit southern hemisphere destinations during the peak of their winter. this increases the range of travel opportunities you can take advantage of during the off season.   southern hemisphere destinations, including australia and new zealand, can be visited relatively inexpensively during their off season  summer in the northern hemisphere .these destinations may be quite cold when you visit, naturally although you ll mostly be at risk for rainstorms.  if you visit an african destination for example, south africa during the months of may through september, you ll be arriving in the middle of the southern hemisphere winter. however, this is a good time to visit sub saharan africa, especially if you plan to spend time outdoors in the natural world. the cooler temperatures will mean fewer tourists.if you choose to visit africa, you will be able to find highly discounted rates in wilderness lodges, and travel with tour groups  including those giving safari like photography tours  for relatively cheaply. considering checking out the deals offered by kensington tours or adventures in africa during  northern  summer months.

online test to deploy your code for the test. this will show a potential employer that you know how to deploy code you have written.    do some of your own research about the company climate.you should try to deduce what the company dress code is, the hours required, and if you will need to travel. arrive 15 minutes early for an interview. this will show you are punctual and have time management skills. prepare several questions of your own to ask an interviewer. you should ask questions about the work environment, company culture, what types of projects you will be expected to work on etc. going to an interview with questions about the job is a good indicator to an employer that you have thought carefully about the interview and the job. avoid common interview pitfalls. don t ask about salary or badmouth past employers and colleagues. don t exaggerate your experience when asked about projects you have worked on.

which does use the zodiac, but goes much, much further. it uses the year you were born and the month, day, and time of your birth, as well. it s similar to the birth chart used in western astrology. it is believed to be a lot more accurate, telling more about your personal life instead of your sign as a whole.   the four pillars are those four factors, in that order. they are also combined with yin and yang and the 5 elements  metal, wood, water, fire, earth . it is all believed to determine your luck, affluence, longevity, happiness, and wealth year by year. chinese astrology works in 60 year cycles. if you re a math fiend with nothing better to do, you could break down the patterns of all these ideas into a sexagesimal cycle.    let s go further than the animal of your birth year. your  inner  animal is determined by the month you were born in. it is believed to determine your later years in life or information about your parents. here s how it correlates to the western calendar    february 4th   march 5th  tiger  march 6th   april 4th  rabbit  april 5th   may 4th  dragon  may 5th   june 5th  snake  june 6th   july 6th  horse  july 7th   august 6th  goat  august 7th

this is the third pillar, believed to determine information about your adult or married life in the day to day. a pretty important one  again, it is a sexagesimal cycle that starts when the sun reaches the celestial longitude of 315  and ends when it reaches the longitude of 330 . therefore, each year is just a teeny bit different.   because it d be ridiculous to list the entire 60 day cycle here, it s advisable to visit an online calculator to find out your element and zodiac sign for your day. if you re really bored, map out the entire cycle     in the four pillars of destiny, the hour you were born represents the final and most personal pillar    it also determines your  secret animal . this is thought to be the truest representation of yourself, the self that has been covered by layers and layers of nurture and environment. it is also used to represent information about your kids or your senior years. here s how it lines up    1 00   03 00 am  ox  3 00   5 00 am  tiger  5 00   7 00 am  rabbit  7 00   9 00 am  dragon  9 00   11 00 am  snake  11 00   1 00 pm  horse  1 00   3 00 pm  ram  3 00   5 00 pm  monkey  5 00   7 00 pm  rooster  7 00   9 00 pm  dog  9 00   11 00 pm  pig  11 00   1 00 am  rat     there s a few things to consider here    every year is either yin or yang. odd years are yang and even years are yin. whatever the current year is, it s that side of the spectrum that tends to get emphasized. every sign is yin or yang as well. this is the side of your personality that naturally has more power    though anything can change in alignment with the stars. yin is associate with passivity, cold, femininity, submissive, dark energy. yang represents activity, heat, masculinity, aggressiveness, and light energy. before you go assuming the worst, know that everyone has both    it s just a cycle. you start with yin, say, until it blooms and turns into yang. and take into account the year s yin or yang, too     almost done  now we re getting to your element. on the outside, it s quite simple. just take the last number in the year of your birth 0 or 1  metal  2 or 3  water  4 or 5  wood  6 or 7  fire  8 or 9  earth  what does this mean  again, it s a cycle, this part emphasizing movement and change. whatever element you are will naturally be emphasized, but how does it mix with the element of the current year  it is believed that the element of the year is the dominant one    some years will work with your element, while others will work against, creating harmony and disharmony.there are believed to be two cycles  the creative cycle and the destructive cycle. for example, water destroys fire but produces wood and so forth. each element affects others in different ways, ideally creating a perfect balance. it is believed that the elements line up with the 4 seasons. wood is the strongest in spring, fire in summer, earth during the season transitions, and so on.each element is dominant for 2 years in a row. the cycle repeats every 10 years  there being 5 elements and all .      you have your own complicated sign, but the years have more detail to them too  each one has a stem paired with a branch. for example, the year 2002 has a yang water stem on the horse branch. the horse branch has not only yin fire behind it, but yin earth too. it s how your pillars fit into every year that determines your cyclical fate.   the ten heavenly stems are a combination of yin and yang and the five elements. therefore, your options are yang wood, yin wood, yang fire, yin fire , yang earth, yin earth, yang metal, yin metal, yang water, yin water.  these go in a 60 year cycle as discussed above. year 1 was rat yang wood  year 61 will be the same, cycling through with no repetitions before that.   the twelve earthly branches are the zodiac animals discussed in the first section. you know, the ones you find on chinese take out menus.    remember that this is a blueprint or map. it cannot be changed. that is nothing to fret about  the chinese believe that this is knowledge to make you powerful    you will be better able to overcome obstacles and grasp opportunities when need be. in other words, you can always do the right thing at the right time.remember that good luck and all positive things don t just happen. this chart is telling you that at certain times, they have potential. you have to go out and get it  by knowing this chart, you ll know when those times are and when you should make your move in alignment with the stars.    to know what seasons  parts of the cycle, not  winter   or years will be for the better or worse, talk to a master of chinese astrology. they ll be able to pinpoint your when you re lucky and, quite frankly, when you re not. certain seasons  days, even  will be better than others  especially to take action  and they can outline that cycle for you.   carry a lucky symbol with you. let s say you re a goat and it s a bad year for you, but it s a great year for the ox. carry a little trinket of an ox around you to circumvent the negative airs around you. use an online calculator if you d like to figure out your sign the easy way. remember to account for chinese time    if you input the timezone of your birth, some calculators can do that for you. and don t forget the new year

query	SemSearch_ES-18	play canasta  from the spanish for  basket,  canasta is a card game for 2, 3 or most commonly, 4 players. it was developed in uruguay in 1939 from an earlier form of rummy, spread through south america and was introduced to the united states in 1948 as  argentine rummy.  most popular in the united states in the 1950s, the game has spawned a number of variations of its own. here are the rules for playing the original forms of canasta.  the basics playing the game two handed   three handed canasta strategy know each card s value. make melds. get excited about red 3 s. know how to go out. pair into partners. deal 11 cards to each player. turn the top card of the draw pile face up and place it next to the draw pile. give each player a turn, going clockwise around the table. evaluate the total value of the cards in the first meld each team makes. continue play until the stock is exhausted or all players have gone out. score all the cards played. see if either team has reached 5,000 points. for two handed canasta, deal 15 cards to each player. for three handed canasta, deal 13 cards to each player. establish the stock and pack as in 4 handed canasta. award the win to the first player to score 7,500 points. keep an eye on the discard pile. keep your deuces and jokers...for a while. don t put down your melds as soon as you can. if your opponent has just  taken the pack,  go out as soon as possible.  in order to understand the scoring system, you ll need to know the value of the cards. they are consistent within the game.   jokers are with 50 points 2 s and aces are 20 points 8 s through kings are 10 points 4 s through 7 s are five points black 3 s are used as  block  cards  when discarded, the next player cannot pick up the pile for that turn. black 3 s can be placed down for points if and only if the player is going out and has no other card in his or her hand to be discarded. when used in this manner, black 3 s are worth five points  the value of the meld is determined by the rank of the card within the meld. what s a meld, you ask       a meld is a group of cards  3 minimum  that each have the same rank. the initial meld in a hand must be worth at least 50 points  though this value increases as the game progresses. upon reaching 1,500 points, the player must have a meld of at least 90. at 3,000 points, the player must have a meld of 120 . melds can include several groups of cards. for example, if you need to have a meld of 90 for a hand, and you have three 5 s, 7 s, and aces, you can place all of these cards down for a total of 90 points. once you have your first meld down, you re free to meld in whatever combinations you see fit.   each meld must have a least two natural cards  no wilds, etc.  jokers and 2 s are wild and can be any value  except 3 s  a meld of 7 is a  canasta.  they must have at least 4 natural cards. a natural canasta has no wilds and is worth 500 points, as opposed to a  dirty  canasta, which has at least one wild card in it and is worth 300 points.    they are treated as bonus cards, and are scored separately from melds at 100 points each. if a player has a red 3 in his or her hand, it must be laid on the table at the start of his turn, and the player draws a replacement card from the draw pile in addition to the regular draw of two cards he or she just made. if a player draws a red 3 from the draw pile, it is laid on the table and the player draws another card. failure to do so penalizes a team 500 points.   melds cannot be made of red 3 s, though if you have 7, you re pretty set.    this ends the hand. when you get rid of all your cards  after you have at least two canastas , it is known as  going out.  if you have a partner, you must ask them if you can go out. if they say  no,  the game must continue.   if you can go out all on one turn  getting rid of all your cards in one go , that is known as a  concealed hand.  this is worth 200 points, instead of going out on the regular, which is just 100.    partners to play canasta can be chosen and the dealer determined by drawing cards from a spread deck as in contract bridge, with the 2 highest draws and 2 lowest draws partnering, and the highest draw choosing the dealer.    you will be working with 2 decks  both with jokers . the remaining 64 cards become the draw pile, or stock.    this card forms the discard pile, or pack. players may, in turn, draw the top card from either the stock or the pack. if a player takes the top card from the discard pile, he also takes the cards underneath it.   throughout the game, you see cards come and go that you want. you ll have to determine whether taking the whole pile is worth the few cards you want. if the card turned over is a red 3  3 of hearts, 3 of diamonds  or a wild card  joker or deuce , the discard pile cannot be taken  it s  frozen  .    a turn consists of drawing a card from the draw pile or taking the discard pile, attempting to create or add to an existing meld and discarding a card   unless the player has no cards left after melding .   as discussed previously, a meld consists of 3 or more cards of the same rank  e.g., all kings, all jacks, all 10s . no more than 3 of the cards in a meld can be wild cards  jokers or deuces , and wild cards cannot be melded by themselves. a meld of 7 or more cards is a canasta  each team must complete at least 1 canasta before its players have gotten rid of all the cards in their hands  gone out . red 3s  3 of hearts, 3 of diamonds  cannot be included in a meld, and black 3s  3 of spades, 3 of clubs  can only be melded by themselves   but only if this permits the player to go out. players can add only to their own or their partner s melds, not to an opponent s meld. a player can take the discard pile instead of drawing a card from the discard pile only if he or she can use the pile s top card in a new or existing meld in that turn. a player can prevent the next player from taking the discard pile by discarding a black 3 or wild card to end his or her turn.    each card has a point value, as described below. the first meld must be 50 points. as the scores progress, the first meld s value increases.   if a team s total score is from 0 to 1,495 points, their initial meld must be worth at least 50 points. if their total is from 1,500 to 2,995, it must be worth at least 90. if their total is over 3,000, it must be worth at least 120.  however, if the team has a negative score, the minimum is reduced to 15.  only the top card from the discard pile, if it is taken to make the initial meld, may be counted toward making the minimum. until a team can make an initial meld that meets the minimum value, including or excluding the pack s top card, neither player can take the discard pile. if a player plays an initial meld that fails to meet the minimum, the cards must be taken back and the team s minimum is raised by 10 points.    if no one has gone out by the time all the cards in the stock have been drawn, play continues as long as someone can take the top card of the discard pile and put it with a new or existing meld. however, no player down to a single card can take a discard pile of a single card.    each team scores points for the cards in all the melds it has made. points are also awarded for having red 3s, making canastas and going out. scores are added to scores accumulated in previous rounds.   each canasta made without wild cards  natural canasta  earns 500 points, while each canasta made with wild cards  mixed canasta  earns 300. a player who goes out by melding all his or her cards in 1 turn  concealed  earns 200 points, while a player going out after melding on several successive turns  unconcealed  earns 100 points. red 3s score 100 points each  if a team has all 4 red 3s, they earn 800 points. however, if a team has red 3s but no melds, they are penalized 100 points for each red 3.  subtract the total value of any cards remaining in a team s hands from their total score.    the first team to do so wins. if neither team has done so, the cards are shuffled and the previous 6 steps are repeated.    two handed canasta otherwise plays by the same rules as 4 handed canasta, except for the following differences    when drawing from the draw pile, a player takes 2 cards but discards only a single card. a player must make 2 canastas before going out.    three handed canasta may be played under the same rules as 4 handed canasta, or with the rule modifications described in the following step.    however, each player draws 2 cards from the stock and discards 1, as in 2 handed canasta. whichever player first takes the discard pile plays as the lone player, while the other 2 partner against him until the round ends. if no one can take the discard pile, each player scores separately. if a player goes out before the discard pile is taken, that player becomes the lone player and the other 2 become partners.   the lone player scores only his or her own total, while each partner in the partnership scores for any melds or canastas made as well as for any red 3s played, provided one of the partners has melded.    do not allow any player to go out before first making 2 canastas. if someone is always winning, you may want to issue the other players a handicap.    knowing just what cards and how many are up for grabs is key to recognizing when you should act and when your opponent probably will. throughout the game, you ll see which cards they re going for    if you re throwing them what they want, they ll surely make their move.   if the discard pile is full of low cards, you may not want to take it. they re worth so few points in the long run that it may not be worth it. you could always force your opponent to take the deck, in a manner of speaking. if you have a card you know they need, throw it down. can they resist picking up the giant pile of subpar cards  probably not.    these are great cards    they have a lot of value. but if you re nearing the end of the game, the last thing you want is to be stuck with them in your hand. they have a lot of value in the negative direction if you don t lay them on the table. and you ll end up kicking yourself if you could ve played them.   if you think your opponent is about to go out  or you re nearing the end of the deck and you ve established the game will end , get rid of them. it s better to do what you can now than be stuck with hundreds of points to get docked later. quite obviously, this is one of the reasons the concealed canasta is so powerful.    you may feel proud and want to show off the points you re accruing, but this isn t the best strategy. laying down your cards is literally showing your hand    your opponents have a better way of hurting you, by withholding the cards you need. and once more, a surprise attack in canasta is always best.   this may keep you from using wild cards when you wouldn t really need to, if you just gave it more time. other players are likely to throw down cards you need, allowing you to use your wild cards elsewhere.    for one reason or another, they just took the pile and now are holding 25 cards in their hand. great. now it s your time to get the heck out of dodge. the number of points in their hand will automatically negate whatever points you don t have sitting on the table.   as long as you have one canasta, you re good. but if you don t, sorry    not an option. you must have one canasta before you go out  or when you go out .  
query	SemSearch_ES-2	generate the best research topics  when you are assigned a research paper, the first thing you need to do is come up with a topic. a research paper is just an essay where you present an argument, backing it up with what others have said. when you first begin writing research papers, your teachers or professors will most likely want to see if you can put other people s ideas together into a cohesive paper. as you advance in your degree, your professors will be looking to see if you can make your own argument, using other s ideas as your foundation.  coming up with ideas researching your idea do some background reading. start narrowing down your area. make a bubble map to help with the idea generating process. keep adding ideas to the bubble map. begin researching the main ideas on your bubble map. get an idea of the research in the field. use keywords to find articles related to your topic. take notes and use them to choose your topic. try to look at your chosen topic in an original way. choose a topic that you enjoy.  to generate a topic for a research paper, you have to do a little reading first. if your class is reading an introductory book, you can get an idea of what you like. if not, you can read one on your own. browse it until you find something that catches your attention.   read as much as you can. at this stage, it s okay to use search engines and sites like wikipedia. they will give you enough information to figure out if you like a topic.    once you have completed your reading, it s time to start narrowing down your areas of interest. you can do this by picking a topic that you like, then delving deeper and deeper into that topic until you find something worth writing about.for example, if your class is  introduction to psychology , you could narrow down your area to behavioral psychology, based on your reading. once you ve established a general area of interest, you can start narrowing your area even further. for example, within the field of behavioral psychology, you may decide to focus only on the work of b. f. skinner. make a list of all the things that interest you within your narrowed topic. maybe you find classical conditioning interesting, or perhaps you find a particular experiment fascinating.    take out a blank sheet of paper. draw your main idea in a bubble in the middle of the paper. draw a line going off the main idea, then make another bubble. in that bubble, put something related to the main idea that you find interesting.   keep drawing bubbles and adding additional ideas. sometimes, you will add your ideas on to secondary bubbles instead of the main one. you can keep expanding an idea out. in fact, it s a good idea to focus on an idea that continues to branch off the main one if you find it interesting. for example, in your main bubble you might put  b. f. skinner and behavioral psychology.  then in one secondary bubble, you might put  the principle of reinforcement , while in another you put  radical behaviorism .    keep working on the bubble map, even when you think you re done. if you push yourself to keep thinking and writing, then you ll continue to come up with interesting ideas. the more ideas you come up with, the greater the chance that you will come up with an excellent research idea.   once you re at a point where you don t want to add anything else, look at the thought bubble map as a whole. what areas are especially developed  what areas do you find the most interesting  can any of the areas be combined to make an interesting topic  circle the ideas that seem to work the best for you. just be careful not to choose a topic that is too broad, as you might be overwhelmed with information and find it hard to find a focus for your paper.  unlike the reading stage, you should start reading some more serious works. look at books in the library.  check databases for more specific articles. don t just google the topic, or search for it in wikipedia.   most major libraries have databases you can use. you will need a library card to access them  some even require that you be in the library to use them. however, databases like ebscohost have many smaller databases that you can search  which ones are included depends on what your library pays for.    research libraries will often include databases on every topic, from business to humanities to psychology. in the advanced search, you can choose which ones you search, so pick one relevant to your topic. you will get academic articles in return for your search. be sure to try different sets of keywords  you never know which set will bring up the results you want.    when you take notes, you can begin to see where different authors reference each other and where different ideas come together. pick one of those intersections as your topic. continue to research it until you can develop it into a paper.    if you re in high school or an undergraduate, your topic doesn t necessarily need to be original, as your professors will mainly be wanting to see if you can develop a theme throughout the paper. however, in graduate school, your topic should be more original.   it should be something that hasn t been covered a hundred times by someone else, so be careful when picking out your research topic. you should get an idea of what has already been covered as you research to help you choose something original. for instance, there s likely been a good number of articles written on b.f. skinner s behavioral psychology, but your idea can be different in how you apply it. maybe you want to apply it to a piece of literature or maybe you want to look at it in relation to current pop culture. the application of it can be original.    also, make sure your topic is something you enjoy, as you re going to be spending some time working on it. you don t want to be researching a topic you hate, as that dislike and disinterest will show up in your essay.for more

theory of natural selection, which became the prevailing theory of evolution. how famous the author is. part of an author s fame can be determined by how much his words have carried outside his own

first appearance of the famous feral man in book form.    a number of book collectors prize first editions of books in areas that interest them, and sometimes outside of them. determining if a book is a first edition, though, is often as much about determining the book is not a first edition as determining that it is.   some first editions display the words  first edition  on the title page, but many don t. a first edition book will have only a single publication date, while a reprint will have multiple publication dates, include the word  printing   as in  second printing   or  edition   with an ordinal number other than  first  , or display a series of numbers, with the lowest indicating which printing it is. in some cases, a book may be reprinted by a publisher other than the publisher who originally published it. it may be described as  first  publisher name  edition  to indicate that the press is not the original publisher of the work.    some book collectors specialize in collecting old books on a specific subject, such as science or medicine, or books that were part of an exhibition such as 1963 s  printing and the mind of man.     as with most collectible items, the fewer copies of an old book that exist, the more valuable each individual remaining copy is. while determining the number of private owners is difficult at best, you can look up how many copies are held in public, corporate, and collegiate libraries by consulting a reference such as the national union catalog, a printed reference, or worldcat, an online database.    a book s condition has an impact on how valuable it is, although this may be offset somewhat by its age. factors in evaluating a book s condition include the following    if the book has all its pages and plates if the book has its original binding if the binding is secure  front and back boards of the cover are firmly attached  if the pages are stained or discolored    the history of who owned the book, or its provenance, can have an impact on its value, particularly if the owner was famous. a bookplate with the owner s name, a handwritten signature, or an author s autograph mentioning the owner s name can help to establish provenance.    a number of printed references to collectible books exist, many of them specialized by the type of book. among them are these    allen and patricia ahern s  collected books  the guide to values  covers first editions. tom broadfoot s  civil war books  a priced checklist  and e. lee baumgarten s  price guide for children s and illustrated books for the years 1880

require you to register before you can search their databases.    appraisals can be done by a certified book appraiser or informally by a dealer in second hand or rare books. depending on the depth of the appraisal, you may have to pay a fee for the service.   you can find a second hand or rare book dealer in your community by consulting your local telephone directory. to find a dealer nationally

of reference directories to find an antiquarian bookseller in north america or europe. to be referred to a certified appraiser in the united states, contact the american society of appraisers or the

use physical humour or act like a clown, she uses her intelligence to be witty, which is very ladylike. a classic quote of miranda s illustrates this beautifully   sexy is the thing i try to get them to see me as after i win them over with my personality.     be organised, not scatty  be punctual, not tardy and know your facts. don t hide your intelligence, very few men prefer  dumb  blondes and those that do, don t think of them as ladies.    samantha sees what she wants a goes for it. be passionate not emotional. rage about things, lust after things, don t day dream about what might of been

t simper or pout to try to get your way if you want to be ladylike in samantha s way.    samantha is the type of lady who doesn t doubt herself. don t be a wall flower at social gatherings, stride

throughout the seasons of the show, occasionally telling lies about their exact ages, but at almost all times, being mature.    to be lady like the sex and the city way, you absolutely must be loyal.

query	SemSearch_ES-24	fish for flounder  flounder can be found on ocean floors,sea coast and coastal estuaries along the atlantic coast. flounder like to hide and ambush their prey, so the trick to catching them is to move enticing live bait across their path and wait for them to strike. when you catch a flounder, you ll be rewarded with a delicate, flaky, delicious seafood meal. see below the jump to find out how to get started.  finding flounder choosing bait and tackle using effective techniques fish saltwater areas on the atlantic coast. fish for flounder when they migrate. look for flounder near the bottom. look for flounder under ledges. check for flounder tracks. use live baitfish. try artificial bait. set up your tackle. drop your bait to the bottom and let it drift. wait a few sections before reeling in a fish. try gigging.  flounder can be found up and down the atlantic coast of the us in rivers, estuaries and streams near the ocean, where they migrate in the fall. flounder fishing is especially popular in southeastern states such as florida, alabama, and south carolina, but flounder are also plentiful in the northeastern coastal areas.   there are often restrictions on the size and or number of fish you can catch, so check your local ordinances. you may need a fishing license to fish in your area as well.    flounder can actually be fished all year round, but they re easier to catch in the fall, between september and november, when they migrate toward the ocean. they spawn during the spring and summer, and when they re large enough, the swim to the ocean to spend the winter there before coming back.   if you want to fish for flounder in the winter and spring, you certainly can  however, expect to catch smaller flounder that may not be large enough to keep. check local fishing reports in the area you plan to catch flounder before you plan your trip.    flounder tend to lie on their sides at the bottom of the river, estuary or coastal area where they reside. one particularly large species of flounder is called a  doormat,  referring to its shape and preference for residing low to the ground.   flounder are grayish brown with lighter spots, helping them blend in with sandy, pebbled riverbeds and estuaries. flounder have both eyes on the same side of their head, enabling them to see what s happening above them as they lie on their sides.    flounder like to stay near ledges and dropoffs, where they can ambush passing fish.find areas where the current runs from shallow to deeper water, and you re likely to spot flounder there.   one good way to figure out where the ledges and drop offs are is by wading the area before you cast your line. feel around with your feet to discover the best hiding places for flounder.    since flounder stay close to the ground, they leave tracks in their wake when they move away to feed. getting familiar with these telltale tracks while the tide is low should tell you where you can find flounder when they come back in with high tide. getting to know the area where you want to fish is the best way to get lucky with flounder. take several trips to the area at both low and high tide to get more familiar with the fish s habits.    flounder respond well to live fish such as minnow, mullet and croakers.sea worms and clams are also effective. hook larger baitfish through the lips, and smaller baitfish through the eye.   you can add some strips of fresh squid or live shrimp to vary the bait mix. if one type of bait doesn t seem to be working, try another. flounder can be picky, and they won t always bite, even if they liked a certain type of bait in the past. consider catching your own live bait in the area where you re fishing for flounder.    if live bait is hard to come by in your area, or if you want to vary things up, use red, pink, white or yellow grub tailed jigs. sometimes flounder actually prefer artificial bait, so it s a good idea to have some on hand if you aren t having luck with live bait.    a medium 7 foot casting rod is standard for catching flounder. use line that s sturdy enough to handle larger fish that might take the bait   14 pound or so. use a circle hook, which is easier for flounder to bite. you ll also need a sinker to make sure the hook is within reach of flounder down below.    flounder typically stay in one place on the bottom, and you ll need the bait to cross their path to hook one. while it is possible to fish for flounder from a stationary location, you re a lot less likely to catch one this way.   flounder fishing is easily done from a boat, since you can let it slowly drift and entice the fish with your moving bait. try to find a current that will move you steadily along the surface of the water without carrying you along too quickly for fish to bite. make sure you can feel the surface of the bottom. if you can t, you may not be using enough weight. attach a small weight  the size of a bb  about 12  to 18  above your rig to ensure that your bait stays along the bottom.    since flounder lie sideways on the ground, it takes a few extra seconds for them to get a grip on the bait. before reeling the fish in, wait about 5 seconds to make sure its mouth is definitely hooked.    you can also catch flounder by  gigging,  which is essentially spearing the fish with a barbed spike. you wade through shallow water at night while the fish are stationary and spear them. aim low because the water will bend light down, making the fish appear a little further away than it actually is.

called a crown  with seven candles on her head. premade st. lucia wreaths are available, but you can also make one yourself.  star boys wear white robes with a white cone shaped hat with stars on it  very similar to a wizard s hat. you can easily make the hats out of white posterboard and star cutouts.  you will need one candle for each participant, as well as seven candles for st. lucia s wreath.

who don t speak the language.  make sure all the lights in the room or outside are off. everybody should have their candle on before the procession begins   in the actual procession, st. lucia walks ahead, with the maidens immediately behind her. the star boys and other participants walk behind the maidens. traditionally, the procession would go along the entire main street of the town, but nowadays it is much shorter. the procession can be as short as a walk up the main aisle of the church.  after the walk is completed, st. lucia stands in the center, with the maidens in a semicircle behind her and the other participants along the sides and back of the semicircle. st. lucia leads the whole group in singing the st. lucia day song, either in swedish or in translation. you can listen

appropriate to invite members of the local swedish community, especially if they are participating in a local procession. otherwise, you can simply invite your own family and friends. since st. lucia day is so close to christmas, it would be a good idea to send out invitations several weeks in advance to be sure people can come.  st. lucia s colors are red and white, but you could also decorate with the swedish flag. you can use crepe paper, bunting, and tablecloths in red and white. most christmas decorations would also be appropriate for st. lucia day, especially decorations with

roll is also suitable. they are eaten with gl gg or coffee. make sure you have the food and drink ready to go before you go to bed   the person playing st. lucia should wake up the rest of the household at dawn to wish them a happy st. lucia day and to serve the traditional morning snack. dawn represents the arrival of light in the winter darkness, so it s important to get up early on st. lucia day.  in sweden, television stations show big st. lucia processions and concerts on the morning of st. lucia day. if you aren t in sweden, you can look up videos online to recreate the

query	SemSearch_ES-83	defend devotion to the virgin mary  god, our heavenly father bestowed upon the the virgin mary the greatest blessing he could ever give to any of his human creatures, when he chose her to be the mother of his divine son. christ himself, consecrated mary as the mother of his church, when she stood at the foot of the cross, during his crucifixion. catholic and orthodox christians rightly honour and revere mary as the greatest of all god s saints. most protestants however  with the noted exception of the anglican church, and quite possibly the lutheran church , accuse us of idolatry, for our marian devotion.  steps know what worship actually is. reverence to holy persons play an important role in all religions. when protestants call mary a sinner, point out to them that she is called  full of grace  by the angel in luke chapter 1. when they argue against mary s assumption into heaven, remind them that both the prophets elijah and enoch were both assumed into heaven too. when protestants claim that the various appearances of mary in various parts of the world  eg  lourdes, fatima, etc  are really tricks of the devil, remind them that both elijah and moses appeared at the transfiguration. protestants quote jeremiah chapter 7, verse 13, when he decries the children of israel worshipping the moon as  the queen of heaven,  and claim that when we call mary  the queen of heaven,  it is the same thing. protestants will quote st. luke chapter 11, where christ tells a woman  blessed are they that hear the word of god and keep it,  after she cries out  blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that you nursed.  protestants think that mary and st. joseph had other children besides our lord. devotion to mary and the saints go back to the earliest times of the christian church s history.  very few people do, which is why protestants accuse catholics and orthodox of breaking the first commandment, with our veneration for mary. had they all know the difference between actual worship and veneration, they too, would still be honouring our blessed mother today. the act of worship is to give sacrifices or offerings. when a protestant is debating with you, ask him her to tell what worship is. then tell them it is the act of giving offerings, etc. the sacrifice of the mass is offered to god alone. not mary nor any other saint. even if a church is named in honour of mary or any other saint, the mass is offered to god only.    note how muhammad is honoured and revered in islam, and yet, muslims do not worship him. the same with abraham and or moses in judaism, and guru nanak and all the subsequent gurus in sikhism. point this out to our protestant brethren.    that means she had no sin    they will cite the following biblical arguments to prove their point  romans chapter 3, as well as when mary calls god her saviour in luke chapter 1, and even when she partook in a purification ceremony in luke chapter 2. for romans, explain to our protestant friends that st. paul was trying to teach his readers not to pass judgement on others. mary called god her saviour, because he saved her from falling into sin. also, challenge our protestant friends  since they claim that mary was a sinner, ask them what was  this sin  that she committed. if they say  that is between her and god,  tell them that they are the ones making the accusation, and therefore should be able to state what her sin was.    why would such an honour given to these 2 prophets be too good to give to mary too     tell them that if apparitions of mary are really from the devil, then so were moses and elijah at the transfiguration. when they try to claim that is a different issue, reassert firmly, that if appearances of mary are really the devil in disguise, then so were the appearances of elijah and moses at the transfiguration.    tell them no it is not. they were worshipping    offering sacrifices    to the moon. moreover, elsewhere in the old testament, in the psalms, there is a verse which says  the queen sits at your right hand, arrayed in gold  psalm 45 . give them this quote, every time they quote jeremiah chapter 7.    they think that christ rejected veneration for his mother. in reality, christ blessed his mother, and not this woman. what this woman cried out would be the equivalent of someone saying today,  wow    your mother should really be proud     tell them that st. luke chapter 11, endorses devotion to mary. not decries it.    they quote all the times our lord s  brothers,  are mentioned. tell them that the word for brother and the word for first generation cousin were the same in ancient greek, and point out to them that james  the brother of our lord,  is called  the son of alpheus,  in the gospels. also, referring back to when christ consecrated mary as mother of his church, he did so by giving her into the care of st. john. that meant that there were no other children in the holy family to care for mary.    even the protestant reformers, such as martin luther venerated mary. rather, it has only been within the last few hundred years, that people have become afraid to honour mary. ask how can christians have been so wrong, for well over a thousand years and onward   
query	SemSearch_ES-84	make lox  lox is a cured salmon fillet that people often pair with a bagel and cream cheese. you can make your own lox using a basic brining technique to make lox. it may sound complicated, but the process is actually quite easy and only requires refrigerating the salmon with a salt and sugar mixture for several days to cure it. if you re in a hurry, though, you can purchase smoked salmon and slice it thinly so you can serve it with a bagel and herbed cream cream cheese just as you would traditional lox.  preparing homemade lox whipping up easy  lox  fixing lox and herbed cream cheese bagels rinse the salmon and check for bones. cut the salmon in half. combine the salt and sugar. divide the salt mixture between the two salmon pieces. set the dill on top of salmon and sandwich them together. wrap the salmon and place it in a plastic bag. weigh the salmon down and refrigerate it for a few days. drain the liquid from the container daily. taste the fish and remove when it s reached the desired taste. rinse the fish and slice it. slide the knife over the smoked salmon at an angle. insert a knife into the smoked salmon shallowly. use a back and forth motion with the knife to slice the salmon. continue slicing until all of the salmon is cut. combine the cream cheese, scallions, dill, parsley, milk, and salt. cut the bagels into rounds lengthwise. spread the cream cheese mixture over three of the rounds and top it with the lox. top the cream cheese and lox with the remaining rounds and serve.  to prepare homemade lox, you ll need 1   to 2 pounds  680 to 907 g  of boneless salmon fillet with the skin on. run some cold water in the sink and rinse the fillet well. next, examine the fillet to make sure that all of the bones have been removed.you can purchase either  belly lox  or regular  lox  fillets. both are salmon, but belly lox comes from the stomach region of the fish. the graining of fat in the stomach region makes belly lox the better option to use when you make lox because it is more widely spaced. this results in a final product that is more desirable and less salty. if there are any pin bones left in the salmon fillet, use a small pair of tweezers or pliers to pull them out in the same direction that they re facing. pin bones are more likely to occur in wild salmon than farmed salmon.    once the salmon is thoroughly rinsed, use a sharp knife to cut the fillet in half. make sure that the pieces are as equal in size as you can get them.  add 1 cup  288 g  of kosher salt and 1 cup  200 g  of sugar to a medium bowl. mix the ingredients together well so they re fully blended.if you like, you can also add about   teaspoon    g  of coarsely ground black pepper to the mixture.    place the two pieces of salmon in a shallow dish so they re side by side. pour an equal amount of the salt mixture over each piece, piling it right on top of the salmon.it may seem that there is a lot of excess salt mixture on the salmon, but the fish will absorb it during the curing process.    after you ve added the salt mixture to the salmon pieces, divide half a bunch of dill with the stems removed between them and add it on top of the salt. next, place one of the salmon pieces on top of the other, being careful not to knock off the salt mixture.  when the salmon pieces are sandwiched together, carefully wrap them in plastic wrap. once the fish is secure in the plastic wrap, set it in a large plastic zipper bag.before closing the zipper bag, be sure to push all of the air out of it first.    set the bag with the salmon down in a shallow dish. place another heavy dish on top of the bag to weigh it down, and refrigerate the fish for 2 to 3 days.you can use any heavy item, such as a bottle of wine, to weigh down the salmon.    while you re curing the salmon, it s important to keep it from getting soggy. remove any liquid that s been extracted from the salmon from the plastic bag and flip the fish over so both sides are evenly weighed down.  at the two day mark, begin tasting the lox. once it has the taste that desire, you can take it out of the curing container and unwrap it.if the lox isn t properly cured after two days, you should leave in the container for another day.    after you ve removed the fish from the plastic wrap, rinse it well under cold water to remove any residue. use a sharp knife to cut it thin on the bias. make sure to leave the skin behind.you can freeze the lox if you don t plan to eat all of it right away. wrap it well in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer bag for storage. you should eat it within 3 to 4 months.    if you don t want to make your own lox, you can substitute store bought smoked salmon. however, you must cut it properly. place 4 ounces  113 g  of smoked salmon on a cutting board, and position your knife against the fish at a slight angle in a downward motion.any sharp knife with a long, non serrated blade works well for cutting the salmon. however, you can also purchase a special salmon knife that s designed specifically for cutting smoked salmon thinly. make sure that your knife is as sharp as possible for the cleanest cuts.    to create the appropriate texture for lox, it s important to slice it as thin as possible. when you insert the knife s blade into the fish, keep it as shallow as you can so you can create a paper thin slice.  once you ve insert the knife into the salmon, move the blade back and forth in a smooth motion until you ve cut a slice. you shouldn t have to push too hard to cut the fish, so if you feel resistance, you may want to sharpen your blade.use the length of the knife s blade to make a long, sweeping back and forth motion for the cleanest cuts.    after you ve cut the first slice, repeat the cutting process until you ve sliced all of the salmon. be sure to leave the skin behind as you cut, and remove any black meat that you come across.  add 8 ounces  225 g  of cream cheese that s been softened to room temperature, 1 tablespoon  10 g  of minced scallions, 1 tablespoon  4 g  of minced fresh dill, 1 tablespoon  4 g  of minced fresh parsley, 1 tablespoon  15 ml  of milk, and a pinch of kosher salt to the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment. beat the mixture on low until it is well blended.you can also use a handheld electric mixer to beat the ingredients together in a large bowl.    once the cream cheese spread is prepared, take 2 bagels and use a sharp knife to cut them into rounds lengthwise. you should create 3 rounds from each bagel for a total of 6 rounds.plain bagels are a classic option for lox and cream cheese, but you can use any flavor that you prefer.    after you ve sliced the bagels into rounds, use a butter knife to smooth some of the cream cheese mixture over 3 of the rounds. add a slice of lox to each round on top of the cream cheese mixture.you can add some capers to the lox and cream cheese if you like.    once you ve added the

query	SemSearch_LS-25	solve a 5x5x5 rubik s cube  solving the original 3x3x3 rubik s cube is hard and will impress your friends. solving the 4x4x4 rubik s cube is even harder and more impressive. but solving the 5x5x5 rubik s cube is even harder and potentially mind blowing. once you know how to do it, you can follow through, step by step, to solve even the toughest of cube arrangements.  before starting solving the 3x3 centers solving the edges finishing up realize that the 5x5x5 cube is more complicated than the basic 3x3x3 cube. know the side notations. solve the top base center. create a cross on the bottom base. complete the bottom base center. complete two more centers. finishing all the centers. verify your cube centers. use a basic strategy for solving the edges. complete the majority of the edges. complete the last two edges. verify your edges. solve the 3x3x3 cube. congratulations     not only it is more complicated, you would also need to know how to solve the 3x3x3 cube and the 4x4x4 in order to be able to solve the professor s cube. solving the professor s cube involves the same logic and contains many similar algorithms that are used in the 3x3x3 and 4x4x4 cubes.    note that although the 5x5x5 cube has an additional row, its notation is the same as in the 4x4x4 cube, since the center row will not be turned independently of other rows.    start with locating the white center piece on your scrambled cube. the white side will represent the top of the cube.   similarly to solving the first layer on a 3x3x3 rubik s cube, create a 3x3 white area in the center by completing inner edges on other sides and then transferring them to the white side. since this is the first step, you shouldn t be worried about breaking up anything and can freely turn the cube as you please as long as it completes the white center.    because the white center is already completed, you want to make a center on the bottom without destroying the white center.   from here, you can start using a simple algorithm r u2 r  for transferring the cross pieces to adjacent sides for such cases.    after you have a cross completed, you would need to fill in the rest of the yellow center.   in order to transfer the inner corners into their corresponding center, perform the algorithm rr u rr  u rr u2 rr . keep in mind that this algorithm will be used in completing other side centers.    first, start with choosing two adjacent side centers.   as in the previous step, complete the crosses on the sides by using the algorithm r u2 r  . after, apply the algorithm rr u rr  u rr u2 rr , to transfer all inner corners to their corresponding sides to form a center.    after completing the first two adjacent sides, complete the two remaining centers on the cube using the same approach as explained in the previous step.    you should have all six 3x3 area centers completed on each side respectively.    most of the edges can be solved using a simple strategy. locate matching wings on the cube and situate them on opposite edges. after, simply connect them and then substitute the entire edge with a scrambled edge.   to connect a wing to its corresponding edge without breaking any of the centers or edges that you have already completed, perform a substitution by using the base algorithm ll  u l u  ll for the left side and rr u l  u  rr  for the right side. note that you might have to search for a scrambled edge by turning the side to which the completed edge is moved.    using the same approach, complete all the edges except for the last two that remain since there would be no other scrambled edges left for substitution.    eventually you will run out of scrambled edges for substitution and you would have to finish the remaining two edges using algorithms. this algorithm will swap 1 wing on the top with its opposite wing on the top. if they re on the right side do this one ll  u2 ll  u2 f2 ll  f2 rr u2 rr  u2 ll2. if they re on the left side do this one rr u2 rr u2 f2 rr f2 ll  u2 ll u2 rr 2.    by now you should have completed all the centers and edges.    after completing the previous step, you can see that you have created a 3x3x3 rubik s cube structure. using your previous knowledge, solve the rest of the cube as you would normally solve a 3x3x3 rubik s cube.    you finally solved the 5x5x5 rubik s cube.

you have to dial  67 before every blocked call you want to make. using a temporary blocking code may also allow you to make calls to phones that have blocked your number.   to use this feature, most providers simply require you dial  67, followed by the 10 digit number  the area code plus the number  you are calling. some providers, such as xfinityand bell,will provide a confirmation beep or tone after you dial  67, so wait for the regular dial tone to return before dialing the 10 digit number you wish to call. for those wishing to temporarily block their phone number from being seen on an iphone on the verizon network, use this trigger before dialing the number to block your number from being seen on the recipient s phone s caller id box. as you ll learn later, setting up permanent

combination of alphabets and 5 6 digits.   choose a code that reflects your cause or campaign. it should be easily identifiable, so that donors can grasp the code and retain it in their memory. as an example, the breast cancer research foundation uses  cure   27722 .    your donation drive will be successful only if donors are willing to support your cause. respect them and their need to privacy.

before signing any type of contract.    if you are happy with all the terms and conditions, go ahead and finalize the contract with your chosen masp..    once you have closed the deal with your masp, you can request them to lease your sms short code from the common short code administration.    once this is done, you can work to build your mobile donors  list. you can then start sending them text messages, requesting them to donate to your cause.    once you have setup your mobile fundraising campaign, you need to let people know about it. one good way to start is by distributing pamphlets and flyers, or by sending them across to people along with their regular newspaper.    you can easily get banners made, with details on your campaign and sms code printed on them. hang them outside your building, in the market or just about any other place where people are most likely to spot them.    login to your social media networks and encourage your friends and contacts to fund your cause. participate in forums to spread the good word.    send out regular email newsletters, talking about your text to donate campaign. tell your readers what you hope to achieve and how they could help others by donating their mite to your cause.    host an event to promote your campaign. you could even tie up with other organizations to co host an event. that will give you plenty of exposure among your community.    reach out to your local radio station, newspapers and media outlets and let them know about your work. many of them are looking to promote social causes. meet up with them and request them to advertise your code.    as you build your mobile list, you will initially have only limited information about your donors, such as their mobile number. use this to send follow up text messages. next, ask for their email address and or send them opt in messages to join other similar campaigns.   make sure to give your donor the choice to opt out at any point in time. it would be annoying for them to keep receiving unwarranted messages. allow them to opt out by replying with a single word message such as  no ,  stop  or  unsubscribe .

query	TREC_Entity-5	manage autoimmune hepatitis  autoimmune hepatitis is an uncommon cause of chronic hepatitis or long and persistent liver inflammation. the cause of this kind of hepatitis is unknown but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease which means that the immune system targets its own body tissues and organs thinking that it is foreign and can cause harm to the body. luckily, there are ways to manage this disease, both through medical intervention, treating underlying causes, and making lifestyle changes.  using medications and or liver transplantation treating any underlying causes making diet and lifestyle modifications understand that there is no cure for autoimmune hepatitis. take corticosteroids. take prednisone according to your doctor s instructions. watch out for the side effects of prednisone. use a drug called azathioprine. take prednisone and azathioprine in combination with each other. understand that your may need a liver transplant. undergo an evaluation prior to the liver transplant. familiarize yourself with how the surgery is performed. treat chronic viral hepatitis. deal with drug induced hepatitis. get conditions such as thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes under control. pay attention to any chronic inflammatory diseases. treat wilson s disease. increase your vitamin d intake. do some weight bearing exercises. quit smoking gradually. stay away from alcohol.  the goal of treatment is to slow down the progression of the disease, stop the behavioral abnormalities of the immune system, and prevent any complication associated with autoimmune hepatitis.    glucocorticoid, or corticosteroid, therapy such as the use of prednisone is generally used as one of the first ways to begin managing this condition. corticosteroids are medications that reduce inflammation and lessen the activity of an overactive immune system.   usually, doctors give an initial dose of 20 to 30 mg of prednisone to those who have autoimmune hepatitis.the maintenance therapy dose ranges from 5 to 15 mg for at least 18 to 24 months of monitored drug intake. keep in mind that people may experience remission or temporary recovery from the symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis, but after the drug has been stopped, symptoms usually do appear again.    prednisone can either be a tablet or given as a solution  liquid form . the drug is usually taken with food 1 to 4 times a day, though your doctor may give you specific instructions.always talk to your doctor before you decide to stop taking a medication like prednisone. abrupt withdrawal from the drug can lead to extreme fatigue, bodily weakness, upset stomach, weight loss, and mouth sores due to the inability of your body to produce its natural steroids.    inform your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms. prednisone has a wide range of side effects which include    headaches, dizziness, acne, having diabetes, cataract  clouding of the lens of the eyes , glaucoma  elevated pressure on the eyes , high blood pressure, and the possibility for osteoporosis  weakening of the bones .    azathioprine is an immunosuppressant medication that lessens the activity of the immune system. it is often prescribed in combination with prednisone to lessen the side effects caused by prednisone, while also managing your condition.   side effects of taking azathioprine include  nausea, vomiting, skin rash, low white blood cell count, and liver damage. when taking this drug, you will most likely have your white blood cell levels routinely checked, as this medication can affect your white blood cell levels.    an initial treatment for this type of therapy includes 10 to 20 mg of prednisone and 50 to 100 mg of azathioprine.your doctor may prescribe different dosages depending upon your specific condition.    a liver transplant is a procedure that removes the damaged liver cells by replacing your liver with a healthier donated liver. talk to your doctor about your options when it comes to getting on the list for a liver transplant.  evaluation is needed to determine if you can undergo such a procedure. certain diagnostic tests include    a laboratory test to determine the health status of your organs, and primarily your liver  imaging tests such as an ultrasound of the liver  and a heart evaluation to determine your cardiovascular status.    during the surgery, the surgeon will use general anesthesia. an incision will be made along your abdomen in order to access the liver.blood supply and ducts are then detached from the damaged liver, and the new liver takes it place. the surgeon will then close the incision using stitches and staples and you ll be delivered to the intensive care unit to evaluate your after surgery status. the surgery may take 10 to 12 hours. you may be asked to stay in the hospital for one to two weeks. you will be given immunosuppressant medications. your recovery period may last anywhere from six months to one year.    viral hepatitis can trigger the occurrence of autoimmune hepatitis. the process by which these hepatitis viruses are able to induce autoimmune hepatitis is not yet fully understood.there is no specific medication yet for hepatitis b and c. the treatment targets the viruses which cause hepatitis b and c, so antiviral drugs such as lamivudine  epivir hbv   are given for hepatitis b virus and sofosbuvir  sovaldi  with ribavirin for hepatitis c virus.seek medical advice regarding drug details and administration procedure.    some drugs are thought to be associated with the prevalence of autoimmune hepatitis. these drugs are  minocycline, hydralazine, methyldopa, statins, azathioprine, diclofenac, pemoline, and interferon.   though it is not clear how these drugs initiate the autoimmune response, research shows that hepatocytes  cells of the liver  can form drug protein antigens  a substance that stimulates the body to produce immune response  which in turn initiates the body s immune system. additionally, these drugs tend to interact with the body s natural killers cells such as t cells and b cells, which in turn initiate a heightened immune response. if your doctor suspects you to have drug induced autoimmune hepatitis, he or she will slowly reduce your prescription for the medication. he or she will not immediately cut back the medication, as this could cause negative side effects.    a definite association between other autoimmune disorders and autoimmune hepatitis is not clearly established and understood. having said that, it is still important to manage these other conditions if you are dealing with autoimmune hepatitis.talk to your doctor about methods for controlling these conditions that will work well with the management plan you have already created for autoimmune hepatitis.    a possible connection between autoimmune hepatitis and rheumatoid arthritis  a chronic inflammatory disorder that affects the small joints of the hands and feet  is not very clear, but some research shows that there may be a connection.inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis  an inflammatory bowel disease that affects the colon and the rectum  and primary sclerosing cholangitis  a chronic liver disease characterized by inflammation and hardening of bile ducts  has a non definitive link to having autoimmune hepatitis.    wilson s disease may also have a connection to autoimmune hepatitis. wilson disease is a genetic disorder that causes defective copper excretion that greatly affects the liver.    some studies show that calcitriol  the active form of vitamin d  can help in liver damage recovery through its anti proliferative  inhibits cell growth  and antifibrotic  prevents tissue scarring  effects.furthermore, research also shows that vitamin d can have an immunomodulatory effect which means that it can regulate the functions of the immune system.    weight bearing exercises can help to keep your body in a fit condition, which may make it more prepared to face conditions like autoimmune hepatitis.   try to exercise regularly. this means roughly 30 minutes for five days a week. this could include walking, jogging, stair climbing, and lifting weights.  smoking cessation can help in the recovery of damaged liver cells. work with your doctor to come up with a plan for you to slowly quit smoking, as quitting abruptly may cause some people to feel side effects like headache and nausea.your doctor may prescribe nicotine aids and may recommend smoke counseling or joining a group for people who are trying to quit.    alcohol consumption is strictly prohibited if you are diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. alcohol damages your pancreas, liver, and other organs. alcohol consumption produces oxidative stress which means that whenever the liver tries to break down the components of alcohol, it consequently damages the liver tissue that leads to scarring and inflammation.
