question	105	this document assumes that you might have another vendor version of java installed on your ubuntu linux system  such as openjdk or oracle java which is common when you use ubuntu linux.  first  of all we will remove and disable other vendor versions of java so there is no system conflict with multiple versions of java.let s assume you have openjdk installed on your system if so we are going to remove openjdk by issuing the following commands to remove openjdk from your system issue the following command type copy paste  sudo apt get purge openjdk   this command will completely remove openjdk jre from your system second  we will disable oracle java if it is installed by editing the  etc profile system path.in this exercise we will comment out the references to oracle java in the system wide  etc profile file i also recommend deleting the oracle java folders if you have them so they do not cause system conflicts.for example if you have oracle java installed in  usr local java follow these instructions to remove oracle javatype copy paste  cd  usr local javatype copy paste  rm  rf jdk1.7.0type copy paste  rm  rf jre1.7.0 if oracle java is installed on your system you will comment out the references to oracle java in the  etc profile  .profile or .bashrc file. for example  as root  use a text editor such as nano or gedit to edit your  etc profile. you may have a file that looks like this java home  usr local java jdk1.7.0path  path  home bin  java home binjre home  usr local java jre1.7.0path  path  home bin  jre home binexport java homeexport jre homeexport path you want to make sure you comment out the references to oracle java  using the    symbol in your  etc profile  .profile and .bashrc file so change the file to look like this   java home  usr
