query	3	brainstorm brainstorming brainstorm small business ideas  you need to know what you hope to gain from brainstorming. whether you hope to clarify a business model  come up with a business idea or product  or find a solution to a customer need  you have to be absolutely clear about the purpose of your discussions. what do you want to have at the end  a completed business plan  a product design  write this objective down and place it prominently in your brainstorming space to keep you and your team on track.  regardless of whether or not you have an actual business idea yet  you need a starting point from which your other brainstorming ideas can flow. small business ideas typically start as something the founder notices  like some kind of unmet need in his or her community or an idea that they have to improve a process. these can be sudden insights or the result of noticing small things through years of work in a certain industry or profession. whatever idea you have that has caused you to bring people together and think up a small business  define it  and then move forward from there.it is also important to clearly and succinctly define the starting point or the impetus for the brainstorming session so that everyone is focused on the same input and outcome. the most successful companies started with a combination of a recognized need in the market and a new technology. for example  google combined people s need to find things easily online with their proprietary search technology. a good starting place could be either one  or both  of these two parts.  your starting point doesn t necessarily have to be a solid business or product idea. instead  it can be a goal  like making money  creating a unique product  or gaining market share. this is more difficult to start with  as you have no guidance on deciding what exactly your future business will do or make. however  this also opens up limitless possibilities. and even if you do have a solid idea  determining what you want from your business can help you with long term planning.    do not invite people who will think the same way as you. successful brainstorming comes from different opinions and perspectives. allow these people to share their own viewpoints  problems  and experiences. for example  you could brainstorm with small business experts or set up a meeting with a mentor or a business leader who you respect and admire.   pitch your ideas to the expert and welcome any feedback. be willing to hear positive comments and negative criticism.express your gratitude to everyone who helped. few people brainstorm on their own  so be sure to say thanks to the team who brainstormed with you. time is a valuable resource  and people will appreciate your acknowledgement of their help and insight.    your brainstorming location is almost as important as the team that you select. make sure to choose a relatively quiet location  free of outside distractions or noise. then  remove all electronic devices from the room  except for computers used for research. provides team members with individual notepads to write down ideas. have a whiteboard  chalkboard  or large pad in a central location to keep track of everyone s ideas.   consider playing music to enhance creative thought. try using classical music without words. provide drinks  like water or coffee  to keep your team hydrated and focused.it may help your team to get out of the area where you usually meet  like going on a retreat or simply going outside to a park. changing your surroundings can help you see new perspectives and change your thought patterns.  read articles  search the internet and watch videos about subjects that are relevant to the business ideas you are brainstorming. the more information you have  the better decisions you can make. you should also look at any past attempts you or anyone else has made to solve the problem you are addressing or fix the product you are focused on. what did they do right  where did their attempt go wrong  bringing this type of context to your discussions can help shape your own ideas.learn about the industry you are hoping to get into. look at its organization  major players  and relevant government regulations. you can also reach out to business connections of yours who are involved in this industry to get their thoughts on certain aspects of the market.  have your group members brainstorm the idea individually and then collect their notes in a google doc or dropbox folder. then  have everyone review everyone else s ideas individually and come up with new thoughts. finally  come together as a group and share these new ideas. that way  you start off with a broader base of ideas.  many successful startups are disruptive in that they offer something completely new to the market that eventually changes how that market functions. think about uber or airbnb  which have perfected new solutions to common problems. these were solutions that no one was sure would work in practice and that stood against the current status quo of their respective markets.   to start  try breaking down a consumer need or imperfect product into it s essence. what service is being provided  ignore current solutions to think of news ways that the problem can be solved. address current assumptions about that product or service directly by writing them down. then  think of ways around those assumptions or ways to replace them.some successful new companies simply make a change to the prevailing business model of their industries  not necessarily changing the product offerings or need addressed. don t focus so much on your offering that you forget the potential benefits of a better business model.  brainstorming cannot work if limitations are put on the creative process. treat every idea by each member of the brainstorming idea the same way  developing it and asking questions until it is either deemed impractical or it graduates to the  good idea  list. agree to consider all ideas  regardless of how impossible they seem.   in fact  coming up with terrible ideas can be beneficial to your creative process. try coming up with the worst ideas you can think of  illegal  impractical  or expensive ideas . then  try to change those ideas to make them better ideas. this process can help you think of your problem in new ways.  brainstorming requires that you ask specific and general questions about every aspect of each idea. try to ask questions that force your team to consider alternatives  rethink assumptions  or continue with their current train of thought. leave your questions open ended and allow your team members ample time to think and respond.  assign a group member to be the secretary or scribe for the meeting. have them record everything discussed  ideas that you choose to move forward with  and your progress or stopping point. this will allow you to pick up where you left off when you have your next session.    it s not likely that you will come up with your million dollar idea on your first try. be persistent and meet regularly with your brainstorming group or with different groups to come up with new ways of thinking. your idea may come to you in a later session or at a completely unexpected time. just make sure to save your notes from previous sessions so that you don t lose any progress.be sure to evaluate your process. when you finish your brainstorming  take some time to note what worked well and what did not work for you in coming up with small business ideas. this will help you in future brainstorming and strategy sessions.    the best ideas are useless if you can t see a way to develop them into a fully functioning business. when you ve come up with several of them through brainstorming  assess your ideas using the following criteria    are you the right person to build on this idea  do you have the experience or technical know how required to solve this problem better than your competitors  will customers want this product or service  a product can be useful in theory  but not enough to make customers actually pay for it. does this idea solve a problem that the customer has  does it do so effectively and efficiently  is the market ready  consider your potential competitors and the barriers to entry that they may present. also  think about whether there are enough prospective customers to keep your business afloat. consider your operations. can you make a business structure to build or provide this product or service  more importantly  can you gather the capital required to develop and build it   be prepared for the challenges and opportunities that come with the small business ideas you are brainstorming. for example  think about the following    the money you will need to start. brainstorm how much capital will be required to start your small business. talk through the best ways to raise that money  whether through loans or investors. the logistical factors that are involved. list the operational aspects of your small business that will need attention  including staff  inventory  physical space for the business and marketing costs. your timeline. figure out how much time it will take to start the small business and turn it into a success. your long term plan. figure out what needs to be done first  then the next steps after that.  the best idea can be chosen according to a few important criteria. first  assess the cost. can you come up with the money needed to pursue this idea  then  consider your business s ability to create this product or service. do you have the expertise  capability  and capacity needed  finally  look for a competitive advantage in your ideas. can you create this idea faster  better  or more cheaply than your competitors  only once an idea passes these criteria should you move forward with it.    once you have completed your brainstorming and you have a vision for your small business  write it down. this will be an abbreviated business plan  which is simply a framework for your business with as much information as your currently have  rather than a full business plan. start with a one sentence description of your idea. what do you do and what will the effect of this product or service be  then  write a short description of this product or service  using the information you have thus far.   write out what you know about your business organization  such as your management structure  distribution model  and pricing plan. determine what it might cost to develop and produce your product or prepare to provide your service. include all potential start up costs. then  include what you know about the market  from competitors and market share to trends and potential customer base.  the only way to know if your business plan will work is to try it. start asking around to your colleagues and connections to form a team to make your idea happen. begin networking with people to the industry you are trying to enter. come up with ways to finance your business. most importantly  continually refine your idea or product until it is good enough to take to market.
query	4	start chain smoking smoke an e cigarette  if you are new to e cigarettes  you may want to start with an e cigarette kit  which can be purchased online. many light to medium smokers go for a rechargeable starter kit  instead of a disposable one  as the e cigarette can be used many times and is more cost effective.an e cigarette starter kit will contain a rechargeable battery  a charger  and a nicotine liquid cartridge. the nicotine liquid can come in a variety of flavors and different levels of nicotine. if you are a smoker who is trying to quit  you may go for a low level of nicotine and a flavor you enjoy tasting in your mouth to limit your nicotine intake. you can get a starter kit with several different flavor cartridges so you can try different flavors and find the ones you enjoy. most e cigarette starter kits cost about  40  100. consider investing a kit with a higher price point if you plan to smoke every day or at least several times a week. going for a cheap kit may mean lower quality and poor flavor choices.    because your e cigarette runs on lithium batteries  it is important that you fully charge the battery before using it. many e cigarettes will come with the battery partly or fully charged. make sure the battery is ready to go by placing it in the charger and waiting for the charged signal or light to come on.most batteries for e cigarettes are rechargeable and can last up to 250 300 uses. batteries often last longer when they are recharged and used regularly. avoid placing the batteries in direct sunlight and heat. do not get them wet or drop them often against a hard surface  as this will significantly reduce their lifespan. try to charge the battery before it is completely drained and always store your batteries fully charged. storing the batteries with less than 50  charge left can drain their use in the long term.    once the battery is fully charge for the e cigarette  take it off of the charger. then  take the liquid cartridge and screw it into the slot on the e cigarette. your e cigarette may come with pre filled liquid cartridges or you may buy e liquid that you can then drop into the liquid cartridge.pay attention to the liquid in the cartridge so you can note when the liquid cartridge is close to running out and requires changing. if you are planning on being a regular e cigarette user  you may want to keep several extra liquid cartridges on hand for easy replacement.    if you usually smoke traditional cigarettes  you may be used to taking quick  short drags and smoking several cigarettes at a time or chain smoking. when smoking an e cigarette  it is important that you learn how to take long and slow draws until the vapor fills your mouth. you should also avoid chain smoking an e cigarette. only take about three to seven draws at a time and take a break. this will allow a few minutes for the e cigarette to cool and to give your throat a rest.smoking too much of the e cigarette at a time or smoking the e cigarette for too long can lead to throat irritation and soreness as well as taste bud burnout  also known as  vaper s tongue . give your throat and mouth a rest between e cigarette sessions so you do not develop any irritation or numbness after smoking.    to warm up the e cigarette  you can start by doing a primer puff. this is a quick inhale into the mouth of the e cigarette to heat up the coil. you should not pull any vapor out of the e cigarette  just get the e cigarette primed for your first draw.  when you inhale  take a slow and steady draw until the vapor fills your mouth. do not draw the vapor into your lungs  or swallow the vapor until the vapor has first filled your mouth.    once you have held the vapor in your mouth for three to five seconds  you can then inhale it into your lungs. then  exhale it slowly out of your nose or mouth.unlike traditional cigarettes  you can absorb the nicotine from the e cigarette into your body through the mucus membranes in your mouth  as well as your lungs and nose.    when smoking traditional cigarettes  you usually wait about eight seconds for the  hit  of nicotine. with e cigarettes  nicotine absorption occurs more slowly through your mucus membranes and can take up to 30 seconds to  hit  you. though you may need to get used to waiting a bit longer for your nicotine fix  it is easy to get used to after using the e cigarette a few times.some smokers crave a distinct hit of nicotine to the back of their throat and may feel that e cigarettes do not provide a strong enough throat hit. often the longer you drag on the e cigarette  and the more vapor produced in your mouth  the stronger the throat hit will be. the flavoring in the e liquid can also affect the amount of vapor produced. you may want to switch to a more tobacco based flavor if you are seeking a stronger throat hit with your e cigarette. as well  you may want to try an e liquid with higher nicotine level for a more distinct throat hit. keep in mind a higher nicotine level can lead to prolonged smoking and health issues like cancer and respiratory disease.
query	5	get funding funding apply for legal funding  there are two primary types of legal funding. they differ slightly  so you should understand which type of funding you are seeking direct plaintiff funding. you already have a lawyer and have filed a lawsuit. the lender will give you a cash advance so that you can pay your living expenses. cash advances typically range from  2 000 15 000 but can be any amount. if you win your case  you repay the amount borrowed  plus interest. litigation cost funding. you might need money to pay for the costs of a lawsuit  such as expert witnesses  court reporters  and investigators. sometimes  you might even need money to pay the lawyer s fees. the lender sends a check to your attorney periodically. as the plaintiff in the lawsuit  you agree to pay back the amount advanced plus either interest or a percentage of the amount you win.    your lawyer s cooperation is key to obtaining legal funding. they will need to talk to the legal funding company and answer questions about the case. your lawyer will also have to complete some paperwork before you can obtain funding.    legal funding has grown over the past couple of decades  so there should be no shortage of companies you can contact. if you don t know where to start  perform a general internet search. type  legal funding  and then your type of lawsuit  e.g.   personal injury.    some legal funding companies specialize only in certain kinds of injuries. for example  they may only fund civil rights lawsuits or only personal injury lawsuits. some companies also fund lawsuits in only certain states.check whether they operate in your state. also check whether the company funds  pre settlement  or  post settlement.  some companies will only advance you money if you already have a settlement in place. these are post settlement companies.    once you have a list of companies  you should perform in depth research. you don t want to sign up with a shady company or a scammer. instead  you should research the company s reputation.   search online. type in the company s name and  complaints.  look around to see if anyone complains of being ripped off. contact your state s attorney general s office and ask if the company has been sued. check the better business bureau. look in the city where the company has its headquarters. pay attention to any complains about the company.    not everyone with a lawsuit qualifies for legal funding. instead  the company will analyze the strength of your case. they will only advance funds if they think you can win.   legal funding is not a loan. if you lose  you don t owe the funder money.for this reason  they will closely analyze your case to see if it has merit. many companies have experienced lawyers on staff who can

 then they will take a cut of your settlement or court judgment. read your fee agreement or engagement letter to see how much. realize that the settlement funding company will take another percentage.   for example  you might win a  200 000 settlement. your lawyer could take 40  of that  leaving you with  120 000. a legal funding company might fund 5 10  of the claim.this means you could pay another  20 000 plus interest  which will reduce your take home amount to  100 000 or less. consider whether you have other options. for example  friends or family might let you move in with them or give you an interest free loan which you can pay back after you receive your settlement.    before applying to a legal funding company  you should talk to someone and ask questions. you want to understand the agreement you are entering. for example  you may want to ask the following    will you be charged a start up fee  are there other hidden fees  what percentage of your lawsuit will they fund  how large of a cash advance can you get  how much interest will you be charged  generally  consumers are charged an annual interest rate of 51 156 .this can add up quickly. when do you have to pay the legal funding company  immediately after receiving your settlement  do you have to make monthly interest payments  does the company provide any additional services. for litigation cost funding  the company may provide a case assessment.  contact the legal funding company and ask how to apply. some companies let you apply online.generally  you will be asked for the following information personal information  name  contact info  etc.  state where your case is filed type of case  persona injury  civil rights  etc.  name of your lawyer lawyer s contact information    make sure to

query	6	bleach hair back to brown hair coloring get blonde hair from dark brown  if you are going from a dark color to a very light blonde  you can expect to do multiple treatments on your hair. wait a few weeks between each treatment so that your hair has time to recover. doing multiple treatments in one day will damage your hair. if you bleach your hair too often it can begin to fall out.  whenever you bleach your hair  an oxidation process is taking place  which removes the color from your hair. this is what leaves your hair a white or yellow shade  because the keratin  the protein your hair is made of  in your hair is naturally a pale yellow. be prepared for your hair to suffer from dryness and brittleness as well as the fact that it will be more prone to breakage and split ends.because bleaching your hair is a serious process that can greatly damage your hair if done incorrectly  it is best to visit a professional if you are looking for a drastic color change. if you don t want to bleach your hair  you can use temporary color  demi permanent  semi permanent  or permanent color. these types of coloring only lightens your hair  so if you have very dark hair  it may not be very effective. however  the benefit of dyeing your hair versus bleaching it is that the dye won t strip your hair of color. it will still damage your hair somewhat  though  so you ll still need to take care of your hair in the same way that you would had you bleached it.    if you are going from a very dark shade to a very light blonde  the process takes some time and during that time your hair will usually begin to develop an orangey tint. this happens because as you bleach your hair  cooler tones are lifted from your hair easier than the warmer  underlying pigments. so  as you remove color from your hair  the warm hues  reds and oranges  are what remain because they are trickier to lift from your hair.   to counteract these warm hues you can add toner to your hair if you are going a very light blonde. this will counteract the remaining color in your air  thus removing those orangey  yellow tints in your hair. you can find the appropriate toner by looking at a toner wheel or asking a professional.  anytime you bleach your hair it is important to take care of it to prevent further damage. before you bleach your hair  apply a deep conditioner  and after you bleach your hair apply deep conditioner again. also  try to avoid using heating products  as the heat from these can further dry out your hair and make it more prone to breakage.if you must use your flat iron  blow dryer  or curling iron  make sure to use a heat styling product that will protect your hair from excessive heat.    before you bleach your hair you should apply a deep conditioner to help protect it and keep it as healthy as possible. bleach will greatly dry out your hair  so adding as much moisture to your hair as possible before you bleach it is an important step. that added moisture will lessen the damaging effects of the bleach.wash your hair a few days before you bleach it  but try to hold off until after you bleach it to wash it again. bleaching freshly washed hair can irritate your scalp  so it s best to bleach hair that has more natural oils in it. you can use a few tablespoons of olive oil or coconut oil as an alternative to deep conditioner. these products will still condition your hair  giving it the moisture it needs.    put on an old t shirt or towel to prevent bleaching your clothes and gather the ingredients and tools you will need  a small bucket or a color bowl to mix the bleach  a tint brush  and rubber gloves.    you can purchase bleach for your hair at a local drugstore or cosmetics store. you ll also need to buy some developer  which helps to lift hair color quickly. follow the directions on the label to mix the bleach and developer together.the higher volume of developer will lift more levels of color out of your hair. a lower volume developer will lift less levels of color out of your hair  leaving it a darker shade after you have finished bleaching it. if you want to take it easy and bleach your hair slowly  it s best to use a lower volume developer. salons usually use a 20 volume developer. a bleach and developer mixture is what salons typically use to bleach hair. you can definitely a purchase a boxed dye mix  but you can t customize it to suit the needs of your hair. it s beneficial to buy the items separately. the cost will be about the same and you ll have better luck protecting your hair.  some people have allergic reactions to certain hair products  so you ll need to test a portion of your hair to make sure the bleach doesn t harm you. take the mixture and using a toner brush  apply to a one to two inch strand of hair on the bottom layer of your hair at the back of your head. leave the mixture on for 30 to 45 minutes and then rinse it out.   if you haven t experienced any reaction to the bleach you can proceed to bleach your hair.    to achieve the best coverage and even bleach on your hair  separate it into four sections. part your hair down the middle of your head or along your part  and then part your hair horizontally across your head. then pull the front sections of hair around your face away from the rest of your hair. you can then clip your hair up to get it out of the way.    start at the back sections of your hair  because they don t absorb bleach as well as the top so they will need more time to sit. gather a piece of hair about a quarter inch thick and separate it from the rest of your hair. then  use a tint brush to apply the bleach mixture  covering the roots last because the roots tend to process faster than the rest of your hair. make sure you have evenly saturated the hair.   be careful not to get the bleach on part of your body or on your scalp as this can irritate your skin and cause a burning sensation. make sure when you bleach the roots that you lift your hair up from your head so that you avoid brushing the bleach onto your scalp.    after you have applied your bleach to several sections of your hair  take a piece of foil about five to six inches wide and lay some of your bleached hair on top of it. then  fold the foil up so that your hair isn t exposed.   you don t have to use the foiling technique  but it can be helpful because it keeps the rest of your hair away from the hair that you have already bleached or if you re doing highlights and want to keep the bleach off of the rest of your hair. if you feel the foiling method may be too tedious  try using a plastic cap. it s much easier on your scalp since the foils can get heavy and it ll be easier to see how well the bleach lifts your hair.    once you have covered all of your hair with bleach  let the mixture sit for about 30 minutes. check it often to ensure it is lightening to the right degree. you may need more or less time  depending on how well your hair takes to the bleach. then rinse your hair out with water and apply a purple shampoo. let the shampoo sit for the amount of time recommended on the label  and then rinse it out.to prevent any extreme hair damage  every 10 minutes  perform a pull test. you can do this easily by simply pulling gently on a few strands of hair from different sections. if any significant amount of hair breaks off or looks and feels  gooey   it s probably fried   rinse the bleach out of your hair immediately and wash with a gentle shampoo and condition. you ll need to seek professional help from a colorist. be sure to do your research before coloring your hair yourself  because your brown hair has naturally warm hues  it will likely have a brassy color after you ve bleached it. purple shampoo helps remove the brassy color and neutralize yellow undertones. if you plan to use toner you don t have to use purple shampoo  but it does help remove those awkward tints to your hair. you can find this shampoo in the shampoo or hair dye section of your local drug or cosmetic store. you can also likely find purple shampoo in the brands john frieda and clairol professional in your local grocery store.if you chose not to use foil  make sure you cover your head with a shower cap  or something else that will prevent it from being exposed to the air    you don t want your bleach to dry out.    if you are happy with the color of your hair  you can proceed to condition it. however  if you want to remove even more brassiness  you can apply a toner to your hair. towel dry your hair and comb it out with a wide tooth comb. then  mix your toner with a 20 volume developer and apply evenly in your hair. cover your hair again and let the toner sit for twenty to thirty minutes.   to find the appropriate toner you can look at a toner wheel. on the wheel find the color that most matches the hues in your hair  and then purchase a toner in the color that is on the exact opposite side of the toner wheel.the amount of toner you mix with the developer will depend upon the type of toner you buy. consult the directions for that specific toner before mixing it together. make sure that you don t condition your hair before you apply the toner as that will make it more difficult for the toner to stick to your hair. if you plan to bleach your hair another time  wait to apply the toner until the last time you have bleached your hair.    once the toner has set  rinse it out with water and apply a deep conditioner. this has been stated several times but it s very important to do this to protect the health of your hair. you can also apply hair conditioning masks to provide even more moisture to your hair.    if you want to go a lighter shade with your bleach  you can repeat this entire bleaching process a second and third time. make sure that you wait at least two weeks between each bleach so that your hair has time to recover. then  apply the bleach in the same way and condition to moisturize your hair inbetween each treatment to keep it healthy.  to bleach hair naturally  meaning the sun will be what activates the blonde in your hair  you will need lemon juice  chamomile tea  or tea bags  and hot water. this process will take a much longer time and can be used to bring out the natural highlights in your hair  but most likely won t bring you to a platinum blonde color.    steep five to ten chamomile tea bags for a few minutes in about half a liter  or two cups  of hot water in a microwave safe glass measuring cup. then  add about one half cup of lemon juice to your tea  pouring it into your solution until it becomes somewhat cloudy.the amount of lemon juice you ll need to use varies  so start with half a cup and pour it into your tea for a few seconds  stopping when your tea becomes a cloudy mixture.    after you have combined the ingredients  you ll want to pour the entire mixture into a spray bottle so that you can apply it to your hair. then  spray throughout your hair for an even coating. your hair should be damp with the solution but not soaking wet.    for the bleaching agents in the lemon juice to work  it will need to be exposed to the sun for a while. stay outside in the sun until your hair dries  making sure to use sunscreen on the rest of your body to avoid damaging your skin. for the best results  leave the mixture on your hair for one to two hours.this method works slowly  gradually bringing out the highlights in your hair  so know that it may take several weeks  spraying your hair daily or every other day  before your hair really becomes blonde  especially if you have very dark brown hair.    anytime you lighten your hair  even with natural products  you should protect it and keep it moisturized by applying a conditioner. you can use a leave in conditioner or coconut oil.
query	7	stop at the scene of an accident hit and run act after a car accident  you will likely be angry  scared  shocked  nervous  guilty  or a combination of all of these emotions in the aftermath of an accident. the calmer you are  the better you will be able to deal with the situation. take a few deep breaths or count to ten to steady yourself.  leaving the scene of an accident  whether you caused the accident or not  can result in serious criminal penalties. the penalties for leaving an injured person at the scene vary from state to state and according to the extent of the injuries  but generally result in fines between  5 000 and  20 000 and imprisonment for up to 15 years  in addition to civil damages. leaving the scene after even minor damage can result in your license being suspended.  the most important thing to do immediately after a car accident is to assess any injuries you or the other drivers and passengers have received. determine your own safety  then check with the other people involved and  if necessary  immediately call for an ambulance.if someone is unconscious or has neck pain  moving them may cause serious harm. leave them in place until medical personnel arrives  unless leaving them in place would endanger them  i.e. they are lying in traffic  their car is on fire  etc. .    even for what looks like a fender bender  it is still a good idea to call. that way you will have an official record of the accident  which will help protect you in case the other party sues you or disputes your account of the accident.police can also dispatch assistance in the event of a serious accident.   stay on the phone with the police until they arrive or instruct you to hang up. many 911 operators can provide safety instructions.ask that a police report be filed. this report will help when filing insurance claims and in the event of a lawsuit.in some states  police will only file a report if injuries are involved. in this case  file a state vehicle accident report  available at police stations or on the department of motor vehicles website.obtain the name and badge numbers of the police who arrive  in case your insurance agent or lawyer needs to contact them.  if you can safely drive your vehicle  move it off to the side of the road and out of the path of oncoming traffic. this will keep you at a safe distance from traffic while you exchange information with the other drivers and make it easier for police and ambulance workers to reach the scene of the accident.  particularly on the highway  anything you can do to alert oncoming traffic that there is a disabled vehicle in the road will increase your safety.  don t try to cross traffic to get off the road  and don t stand next to a car that is stranded in traffic or on the shoulder. people who get out of their car are killed or injured more often than those who stay inside.however  if you smell gas  get out of your car right away. this could signal a fuel leak that could lead to a fire or explosion.  get the names and phone numbers of all the other drivers involved in the traffic accident. write down the make  model  year and license plate number of each vehicle. be sure to obtain all insurance information including the company  policy number and any insurance agent contact information the driver can provide.be polite  but do not apologize. if you say   i m so sorry i hit you   you may be admitting legal liability for the accident. try not to admit guilt unnecessarily like this  as it may not be clear who was at fault in the immediate aftermath.be wary of identity theft. criminals sometimes stage fender benders in order to obtain the information needed to steal another motorist s identity. never give out your social security number or let another driver take a picture of your driver s license. for safety reasons  don t provide your home address  either.    obtain names and contact information for any witnesses of the accident. write down their account of what happened and make sure they agree to let your attorney or insurance agent contact and question them. they may be helpful if the other driver disputes your account of the accident.    photograph damage to your car and the other vehicles involved in the accident. also take photos of the accident location and the people involved. this will help document the damage when you submit an accident claim to your insurance company. it will also help protect you in the event the other motorist claims more serious injury or car damage than actually occurred.  immediately report the car accident to your insurance company. also provide the insurance company with information on the other driver. immediately filing a claim will speed up the process of getting your car repaired and securing a rental vehicle  if necessary. do not lie when stating the facts of the accident  as this can result in denial of your coverage.the other driver may suggest not filing claims in the event of a small accident  as filing a claim will raise your rates. however  it is always a good idea to file a claim to protect yourself. the other driver may later change his mind and file a claim  even claiming injuries that weren t apparent at the time of the accident. you want to be sure your insurance company has your version of the accident as soon as possible.  particularly if anyone was hurt in the accident  hiring a lawyer is a good idea. a lawyer can help you maximize your reward if you have been injured  or defend you if the other motorist was injured.  keep records of any hospital visits  tests  prescriptions or other expenses that arise as a result of your auto accident. this information will be needed by your insurance company and attorney.    if the accident impacts your life to the extent that you decide to file a personal injury suit  you can claim damages for mental and physical distress and or lost wages  as well as medical treatment. keep a diary of how the injuries impact your life  including missed workdays  routine activities you cannot undertake  and changes to you family life.  this will determine how much your company  or the other motorist s company if they were at fault  is willing to pay to replace or fix your car. if you think the number is too low  get your own independent estimates  and then discuss them with your adjuster.  certainly the other motorist s company  and perhaps your own  may not have your best interests at heart.if the other motorist s insurance company calls you  politely refuse to discuss the accident with them and mention the call to your own insurance company or lawyer. if your company offers you an early settlement  do not sign it until you are sure you will be compensated for all your injuries. some injuries   particularly back and neck ones caused by whiplash   might not show up or reach their maximum level of pain until weeks or even months after the accident.  
query	8	suggest a foreign language thats easy to learn language acquisition teach adults a foreign language  it is well established that young children are  on average  more adept at acquiring second  and beyond  languages than older teens and adults. the reasons for this  however  are not as clear.   small children tend to excel at picking up spoken languages through simple exposure to them  and some theorize that this skill is lost around the ages of 12 14 as the brain reallocates its precious resources to other  more important areas. essentially  you are likely to have learned to communicate by then  and thus no longer need to expend substantial brain power toward that ability.whether or not changes in the brain make language acquisition more challenging for adults  it is certain that adults tend to be busier  more stressed  and less singularly focused on picking up the language. adults have also picked up a lifetime of assumptions  conventions  perspectives  biases  and habits  all experienced via the native language  that can make developing  communicative competence  in a second language  with its own cultural  baggage   a more arduous task.    with any desired skill  talent  or ability  having a clear goal in mind makes the process of acquiring said competency more manageable. the same holds true for language acquisition.as a teacher  it may benefit your adult students if you help them define a clear  and ideally short term  goal for why they want to learn a particular foreign language. instead of promoting language learning as beneficial in and of itself  even if it is   help them focus on their desire to connect more deeply with a grandparent or be prepared for a long awaited trip abroad. as you help students find their motivation  feed it through targeted tasks. for instance  offer a project that involves interviewing the grandparent in his her native  and the student s second  language. be aware  however  that motivation will vary in intensity class to class  so be prepared to take advantage of high points and offer encouragement during lower ones.    while you have an essential role as the teacher  the students in the class can also be critical to each other s ability to learn a new language. learner to learner interaction tends to help both parties  notice the gap  between their communication in the language and the proper form.offering learner to learner tasks  such as having one student describe a picture in the foreign language to another  who must draw it  can not only be fun but helpful in enabling students to work through gaps in their comprehension. while such tasks need not replace more traditional methods of teaching vocabulary and grammar  this more indirect method of teaching the  nuts and bolts  of a new language does seem to be at least as effective at instilling them in the long run.    however  simply encouraging students to read level appropriate and interesting passages  both in class and at home  can be an effective strategy. this is especially true when the readings are combined with vocabulary building activities. games like bingo  password  and concentration can facilitate  active meaning negotiation   where task oriented problem solving helps build an  incidental vocabulary    almost  in essence  picking up new words without realizing it.    there are as many ideal ways to learn a new language as there are people wanting to do it. some even say that foreign languages cannot be taught  but only learned  implying that each learner s unique motivations and skills must be prioritized.each time you teach a new student or new class  then  your methods will likely need to adjust in order to have the most impact. be flexible and willing to work with your adult learners  while drawing from a range of theories  strategies  and practical advice.    whether you learned a second language by drills  flashcards  and rote repetition  or by visiting a foreign country for the summer  there is likely a language theory that matches your method. familiarity with the bases of such approaches will help you formulate your teaching strategy for adults.from the time of ancient greece to well into the last century  new languages were almost invariably taught by what is often called the  audio lingual method.  if your high school french class involved a lot of rote learning  repetition  oral and written testing  emphases on grammar and translation  and constant correction by your teacher  you re already familiar with this method. in the last half century or so  a more  so called   natural approach  has become predominant. it tries to replicate the childhood process of acquiring a language through immersion  play and tasks  constant usage in a low pressure environment  and indirect emphases on grammar and vocabulary.    modern  natural  or  immersion  methods encourage leaners to jump right in to the foreign language without the drudgery of vocabulary lists  grammar lessons  and constant repetition. therefore  they are often a more appealing prospect to harried  hurried adult learners.such task based methods are based on the premise that students will naturally  work out  vocabulary and grammar as they interact with the language  and the other students . the struggle to do so  essentially  is part of the learning process. critics  however  say that this leaves too much vital material for the student to address on his or her own  and that the teacher s guiding hand in areas like grammar is vital  even if it can sometimes be less than enthralling.  despite the reputation they ve assumed as  boring    sterile   and  outdated   there is a reason why classic approaches were used almost exclusively for thousands of years. even in the modern world  they can still have a place in the language classroom.   the  audio lingual  emphasis on habit formation  mimicry  memorization  and repetition can provide a clearer sense of the goals  processes  and achievements for some students. likewise  a focus on grammar and translation  guided in the first language  can build essential skills that some adult learners may be keen to acquire.that said  for many adults  traditional methods will feel too much like being back in school as children  and can dissuade them from continuing the process with enthusiasm. this is why variety and flexibility in your teaching methods are essential.  for all the value in understanding theories  learning happens in practice   and usually  through practice. simply put  teaching an adult a foreign language requires not only your mastery of the language as a teacher  but also a clear understanding of your student s background  motivation  goals  learning style  and needs.   holding fast to traditional methods simply because they have been in use for centuries is usually not the answer  nor is tossing all the old ways aside for the new vogue in language education. it is up to you  the teacher  to determine the mix that will work best for your classroom and your student s .  learning a new language can be a stressful experience for many adults  and can make them feel like children struggling to pick up something new. build on the positives of this perspective by enabling your students to have some fun with it.   most adults like to reminisce about their own childhood  or that of their growing   grown children. let them pick a favorite kids  book from one of those times that is available in the foreign language  and read it together in class. it will seem familiar but new  and fun but challenging.listen to songs  even sing songs together in class. use familiar nursery rhymes and lullabyes in the foreign language  along with songs distinct to that language   culture.    most adults will be sympathetic to the experiences of the other students in the class  and want to help each other succeed. and  according to the notions of task based learning discussed in this article  having students learn from each other s successes and mistakes is vital to adult language development.one good paired activity is the aforementioned  information gap  game of having one student describe a picture in the foreign language to another  who must draw it. a similar option is having students do a variation of the old  pass a secret down the line  game  except having them alternate the language in which the sentence is whispered     essentially translating back and forth down the line . even simply encouraging your students to listen to each other carefully as they attempt to solve problems and answer questions can be quite useful. hearing others struggle and succeed provides both consolation and challenge.each student will also naturally  notice the gap  between the response given  how they would have responded  and or the correct response  thereby helping to build confidence and competence.  unlike many child students  adult learners usually have a specific goal in mind for wanting to learn a foreign language. crafting activities that support this goal  and offering related goals and rewards along the way can fuel motivation and a sense of achievement.if your adult student hopes to land in a foreign country and be able to  jump right in   consider having them watch episodes of a program in that language  without subtitles    and attempt to summarize what they can from full speed conversations in the foreign tongue.set up a pretend restaurant  for instance  in the classroom. offer simple prizes for the student s  who do best in ordering lunch. adults like to be rewarded for small achievements just as much as children.    no  the adult classroom  just like the child one  cannot be all fun and games. most adults will want it to be a fun experience  but in the end  learning the language is the goal.   some of the traditional methods that have at least partly fallen out of favor may be of more value to adult learners  especially those who are self motivated to learn the language. they will be more willing to copy down verb tables and go through flash card drills.speaking of copying down information  encouraging your students to write down information longhand may be beneficial.  it will also probably be easier to convince adults to do this than their tech savvy kids.  research indicates that handwriting information aids memorization more than typing  as it requires more active participation in the process.
query	9	help you come up with possible solutions mediation mediate a dispute  some courthouses offer mediation programs.in fact  some courts require parties to attempt to mediate the dispute before the lawsuit can continue to proceed. if you are interested in mediation  then check with the court clerk to see if your court offers a mediation program.   your courthouse also might keep a list of approved mediators.you should ask if the clerk has a list you could look at.    you can do a general search for  mediator  and your city or county. there are also different online directories you can use to find a potential mediator.   the website mediation.org has a directory you can search. type in your location and the nature of your dispute.you can then review the list of potential mediators in your area. click on a name to review a mediator s education  mediation experience  and hourly fee.    there are many private mediation organizations which you can contact to find a mediator. generally  you would only get mediators from these organizations if you have a complicated business dispute worth a lot of money. you could contact the following jams american arbitration association judicate    some local or state bar associations also offer referrals to mediators. a bar association is an organization made up of lawyers. since many lawyers are also mediators  you can get a referral through these organizations.   you can find contact information for your nearest bar association by visiting the american bar association website.  you and the other side should pick the mediator jointly  so that no one thinks the mediator will be biased. you can both review the mediator s credentials by asking for a resume  and each of you can talk to the mediator before agreeing to hire him or her.   you will also split the cost of mediation. generally  mediators charge  70 400 an hour  depending on the complexity of the dispute.mediators will determine when they get paid. however  many require payment after each mediation session.  the mediator might call you before the mediation in order to get some background information on the dispute. the mediator will also call the other side. the purpose of the call is to figure out areas of disagreement as well as areas of agreement.the mediator might also give you paperwork to fill out.you don t gain anything by shading the truth  since the mediator is not a judge and will not be on anyone s  side  during mediation. be as honest and as objective as you can. don t speculate about what the other side wants unless the mediator asks you to.    before you can negotiate effectively  you should think about what you hope to get out of the mediation. ideally  you will resolve the dispute in some way. you should think about your priorities.   for example  in a divorce mediation  you will likely discuss the division of property and debts  child custody  child support  and possible alimony. you should have some understanding of what you would like to get. you should also establish priorities. for example  getting full custody of your children may be more important than alimony. if you ve already filed a lawsuit  then review your complaint or petition and see what you have asked for.    you should give some thought about what other options you have besides reaching a settlement agreement. for example  if you are involved in a personal injury lawsuit  then your next best alternative might be to go to trial and defend yourself. this is your batna   best alternative to a negotiated agreement. your alternative may or may not be appealing. for example  in a divorce  your batna could be to go to court and have the judge decide custody. however  this can be emotionally draining on your children  so you might want to avoid it. alternately  your batna might be fairly attractive. for example  if you are the defendant in a lawsuit  then you might be confident that your evidence is strong. if so  your batna could be to go to trial and win the lawsuit.    mediation is a voluntary process  and you can walk away at any point if you think that the mediation has stalled. you should identify the absolute minimum that you are willing to settle for. this is called your  walkaway  point.if the other side can t meet this minimum  you leave mediation.   the attractiveness of your batna will in large part determine your walkaway point. if your batna is strong  then you could come up with a favorable walkaway point. for example  if you have a good defense to your lawsuit  then your walkaway point might only be 25  of what the plaintiff is asked for. take a fresh look at your dispute and any evidence that you have available. try to analyze the strength of your case. if going to trial is your batna  but your evidence is weak  then you might be willing to give up a lot during mediation. for example  you might settle for an amount close to what the person suing you has asked for.    each mediation might be a little different  but often the mediator will begin by introducing everyone and explaining the rules and goals of mediation.the mediator will also encourage each side to work with each other so that the mediation can be successful. the mediator might also have you sign a confidentiality agreement and probably will also explain that they will not divulge any statement either side made in mediation.  each party in the mediation gets to deliver an opening statement. the purpose is to explain in your own words the substance of the dispute and how it has affected you. you must listen quietly to the other side s opening statement. don t interrupt.if you were injured in a car accident  you could say   as i see it  this dispute involves who is responsible for the crash. i was driving through a green light when mr. jones sideswiped me. immediately  i couldn t feel my legs  and emergency services had to pry me out of the car. at the hospital  i had two surgeries to try and set the bones in my legs  which were broken into dozens of pieces. since then  i ve had three months of rehab and still can t put full pressure on my legs. i need compensation to pay for my medical bills and lost work  and to compensate by pain and suffering. if we could agree on a realistic amount of compensation  i would feel comfortable dropping the lawsuit.     the mediator will also try to prompt each side to begin to talk with each other. at this point  you can begin to identify what issues need to be addressed by the mediation.try to practice an active listening style. sit comfortably so that you face the other person. don t cross your arms or angle your body away. make eye contact as they speak to you and nod your head occasionally to show that you hear them. remember to use  i  statements instead of  you  statements.the other side is less likely to get defensive when you speak about how you feel.    one benefit of mediation is that you can actually have a conversation. if you are in a lawsuit  you probably assume that you already know what the other side wants  to win the lawsuit. however  the other side could be open to compromise. you should try to figure out what issue is most important to the other side.for example  someone might be willing to pay money compensation but wants to avoid admitting that they were at fault. you can agree to a monetary settlement without requiring the other person to admit that what they did was wrong. by contrast  someone else might really want an apology  with monetary compensation a secondary consideration. you might be pleasantly surprised that the other side isn t too focused on money.    as the mediation continues  the mediator might feel that it would help to meet with each side individually. this is called  caucusing.  the mediator will meet with each side in their own room and then shuttle back and forth between rooms.   during the caucus  you can speak more openly with the mediator and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your position.you don t have to worry about the other side finding out what you think or fear  the mediator will keep your confidences. the mediator might also float creative solutions for you to consider privately. you can discuss the strengths and negatives. if you reject a solution  then the mediator won t mention it to the other side.    if you do reach agreement  then the mediator may write down the main terms of your agreement on paper and ask each side to sign. you should then take the agreement to a lawyer and ask them to review it.you might not reach agreement after one mediation session. in this situation  the mediator will review what progress has been made to that point and possibly recommend additional mediation sessions.    often  you are in a legal dispute because the other side is being unreasonable or underhanded. however  you should avoid using insulting language.don t call someone an  idiot  or  scumbag.  if you are involved in a dispute with a landlord  don t say   you are a slumlord.    insulting the other side is never productive in mediation. remember that you agreed to mediate because you honestly want to reach a resolution. putting someone on the defensive will impede reaching any resolution.    mediation can become emotional. you might hear the other side say something that upsets you. your instinct might be to lash out and say something snarky or rude in return. you should try  as best as possible  to avoid doing so.if someone has just said something incredibly hurtful  it is better to ask the mediator for a  time out  so that you can cool down. when the anger has passed  you can return to mediation.    you don t know what has motivated someone s actions. accordingly  you shouldn t state that you do. often  you will be tempted to assign a motivation that makes the person look bad.saying  you tried to fire me because you don t like female supervisors  is a statement where you pretend to know what is motivating someone. it also allows you to claim the other person is sexist  which may not be true.    you should not use these words. they are unproductive because the other side will come up with counterexamples to show that something isn t always or never true.in this situation  the mediation becomes an argument about side issues  which is not helpful.   if you do accidentally make an  always  or  never  statement  then apologize and try to move on. don t get hung up in an argument.  
query	10	do any aerobic physical activity pull up improve your study routine with exercise  if possible  do physical activity before you study. go for a jog before you sit down to study for a test or go over your class notes. hit the gym on the way home to swim some laps so you are ready to study that evening.doing aerobic activity gets blood  oxygen  and nutrients to your brain  which helps your brain function better.    a few studies have shown that performing light exercise while studying can help recall of information. if you are going to exercise while studying  just make sure to keep it gentle.these studies found that vigorous exercise while studying may hurt recall because your brain is focused on the workout instead of the information. to try this  take your textbook or notes to the gym. use the stationary bike while you study for at least half an hour  making sure to keep the intensity light and gentle. you can also use an elliptical  treadmill  or stairclimber.  studies have shown that exercising before and while you study are not the only times that benefit your recall and mental processing. working out after a study session can also help boost your mental function and improve your studying.go for a walk or even lift weights after you study to help your brain stay active so your studying can pay off.    if you are studying in the library  break up your study sessions with physical activity. get up and take a fifteen minute stroll around the building or around campus nearby.you can also do this if you are studying in your dorm or a coffee shop. taking a break helps refresh yourself and gets blood flowing to the brain  which can help you think and remember better.    you can get your blood pumping at your desk while you study. if you don t want to leave everything and go for a quick 15 minute stroll  try getting some physical activity in where you are.do some chair squats at your desk. stand up from your chair  then squat down without sitting down. hover just above the chair for about 10 seconds. repeat this 20 times.try wall sitting. lean against the wall and slowly lower yourself into a squat position  using the wall to support your back. hold for as long as you can  or do 20 sets while holding for 10 seconds each. you may also wish to lift one leg as you hold the squat for an extra challenge. use resistance bands while you sit there and study. put one in each hand and pull on them for an upper body workout. you can also try holding hand weights and doing bicep curls while studying.    adding exercise to your schedule may take some planning  but it won t be impossible. to get the benefits of the physical activity  schedule 150 minutes of exercise into your week.adults should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity aerobic activity  or a combination of these.adolescents should get at least 60 minutes of moderate or vigorous physical activity each day.  there are so many activities you can do for aerobic exercise. you can join intramural sports teams  go for walks with friends  or hit your college s gym. make sure to think about whether you are doing moderate or vigorous intensity workouts.moderate physical activity includes brisk walking at three miles per hour or faster or bicycling slower than 10 miles per hour. you can also play doubles tennis  go ballroom dancing  or do general gardening. vigorous intensity workouts include race walking  jogging  or running or cycling faster than 10 miles per hour. you can also swim laps  play singles tennis  do aerobic dancing  jump rope  or hike with a heavy backpack or uphill.many gym classes provide excellent opportunities for vigorous and moderate exercise. any aerobic activity should be

daily exercise. if you walk 10 or more minutes to class or work  this counts as aerobic physical activity. if you can start walking to class  make that one of your changes. choose something that you believe you will enjoy and that can easily be placed into your schedule. if you have trouble finding time to workout  consider going out for a 30 minute jog or dancing around your room for half an hour. breaking up exercises into smaller increments  such as three 10 minute fast paced walks  can offer brain boosting benefits if you struggle fitting exercise into your day.  consistent daily workouts  or workouts that coincide with your studying and classes  are more effective than trying to get 150 minutes of physical activity in on the weekend. the consistent physical activity

query	11	know who do the spoof  spoofing attack make a funny movie spoof  with the possible exception of mel brook s space balls  which took aim almost exclusively at star wars   a mega hit that almost everyone has seen   almost all great spoofs cast their net widely. it is no mistake that brook s other films hit bigger targets like monster movies  young frankenstein   westerns  blazing saddles  and historical epics  history of the world pt. 1 . the master of spoof and parody understood that the more people feel included  and the more people understand broader references  the funnier the film will be.   movies and genres that tend to take themselves very seriously tend to be the best targets of satire. generally  the more a movie or genre tries to avoid humor  the riper it is for making fun of.genre movies are those with similar plots    any type of movie you ve seen 10 versions of  like slasher films  romantic comedies  sports films  etc.    a great spoof pays attention to the  original  and uses it as the jumping off point for the screenplay  and you need to do your research. watch both the movies and any other related spoofs  noting what they find humor in and where things are ripe for joking. some things to pay attention to are recurring character types  is the cast usually a variation on the same 3 characters  if so  you ll need to include parody versions of them  too.  common cliches and story arcs  are their plot moments  lines  or shots that every single movie has in common  how can you subvert them to make them funny   themes or issues of the genre  what does the movie seem to address  is it over the top action and adrenaline in cop movies  spoofed in the other guys   or self righteous documentaries   spoofed in the series documentary now   .     there are few movies without plot holes  and most things you re spoofing will be full of them. instead of shying away  expose these plot holes to comical extremes  pointing out places the  original  film got a little too ahead of itself. again  remember that broader plots  like how horror movie characters always want to  split up   are easier to spoof than one plot point in one specific movie. most spoofs basically steal the common plot structure from the movie they parody  using this as the framework to make jokes from.   having the characters acknowledge the issue or problem  or have one character in particular who jokes about the plot hole  like the stoner in house in the woods .  forcing  the plot on the characters  for example  the character accidentally becomes the classic hero or saves the day  despite trying not to be involved  or not trying at all . resolve the plot holes in a ridiculous way  blazing saddles does this with great skill   or simply cut to the aftermath of the big moment without explaining how everyone made it through  like anchorman s quick turnaround on will ferrell cleaning up and putting on a fresh suit in under two seconds.    one of the best examples of this  spoiler alert   is in the medieval spoof monty python and the holy grail  where the film ends with king arthur and his knights getting arrested by modern day cops in the midst of an enormous battle    it turns out the whole movie is just adults playing violent dress up. surprise is at the root of all comedy  and spoofs are the perfect place for a surprise    your audience knows what plot point or reveal is expected based on the original movie or genre. shake it up    inverted characters are always a great spoof tactic   from bumbling  expert  cops in the naked gun to the intelligent  kickass sidekick in the green hornet remake.    this is spinal tap  a parody of rock documentaries  takes this joke almost literally in the infamous  11  speech  where a guitarist brags that his amp s volume knobs go all the way up to 11  not just 10 like a normal amp. spoofs gain humor by exposing how ridiculous the ideas and plots of movies really are  and how far off they are from the real world.    the greatest parodies  almost without fail  still manage to respect and honor the movies they are spoofing. the do this by remembering what made the movies so special and worth of parody. after all  no one spoofs a movie that no one watched in the first place. this can mean expanding on the themes or the film  like in sean of the dead  or simply picking out the most popular elements and playing them up highly  like in austin power.sean of the dead begins the film with a zombie like walk to and from work  then repeats the same shot after a zombie infestation occurs. the main character doesn t notice anything different the second time  a comical moment that reinforces the idea that we re all zombies sometimes    an important theme that plays out up until the very ending.  austin powers follows a typical spy plot  but its longevity comes from its recognition of what makes the spy movies so fun    traveling the globe  crazy fashion and gadgets  and lots of beautiful women.    in comedy  the straight man is the person who most represents the viewer. they are the only ones who seem to realize how insane or crazy things are around them  which makes the craziness and spoofing around them all the funnier. think of simon pegg s tightly wound cop in the police parody  hot fuzz   or michael bluth  in arrested development. while a bit of an advanced skill  peppering in the  voice of reason  will make all of the ridiculous stuff sound normal by comparison.   the straight man can be a parody as well  and it is usually best when they are    the main character of airplane  is a war pilot coming back to face  calm  normal life as a civilian pilot. but  if you ve seen any disaster movie ever  you know it won t be so easy.  a funny spoof needs to be a funny movie all on its own  and constant references to other films will get old fast. let yourself cut loose and just be funny  even if the joke doesn t have a  cousin  in the real movies. open  original jokes will make the film feel less like a rip off  or one of those widely panned spoofs where every joke is simply a reference to things that happen in other movies.   use your references to add a layer of humor  not to supply all the jokes. check austin powers  for example. dr. evil is a great parody of common spy villains  but things like his relationship with his less evil son transcend parody to become great family comedy in any movie. this makes the son s turn towards evil even funnier later on  as the parody aspects come full circle. one of the funniest scenes in will ferrel s telenovela parody casa de mi padre is a take on the cowboy singalong  but as the musical continues it veers into wildly different  and hilarious  new territory based on the image of them all singing.  for example  any spoof of the blair witch project should be using hand held camera work to replicate the shaky look of the original. shooting a game of thrones parody  you better have lots of low camera angles on the power players and dramatic  sweeping shots of your location  which can humorously reveal things as you turn the camera .   not all movies have an easily discernible visual style  but they all have common pieces. while romantic comedies are shot in a straightforward manner  you definitely need a  happy music  montage of the couple falling in love. the other idea is to go as far from the actual movie as possible  shooting instead in a comically different location  like the aforementioned ending of the holy grail.     the best spoofs play off of the original movies from script to stage  and your actors are a key factor. show them the characters they are spoofing in their  natural habitat  so they everyone is on the same page. find the major motivation or parody of the character   the pompous hero    the bumbling sidekick    use these characters as baselines  especially for big moments. instead of starting from scratch on a rakish  sleazy pirate ship captain  you can say  act like han solo  but way creepier and more flirty.     looking at the camera  laughing  or acknowledging that this isn t how things normally are is called  breaking the 4th wall.  you re basically reminding everyone that they re watching a movie  which can work in small doses  see the film noir spoof kiss kiss  bang bang for a wonderful example   but most jokes should be told  straight.  that means your actors accept the lines and events as if they were real life. to your characters  the world they live in is the only world they know  no matter how wacky.   check leslie nielsen  star of famous spoofs from  airplane   to  the naked gun  for a masterclass in straight faced comedy.  it may seem counter intuitive to ape the movie you re making fun of  but this level of detail will make the jokes far funnier. great spoofs could  at quick glance  be the very movies they are making fun of. this sucks the audience in. the surprise of your twists and jokes are much funnier because they are juxtaposed against a more  serious  backdrop.    the tv show community s now famous action movie spoof   modern warfare   had more visual jokes than most full length spoofs. from the general  such as a trickle of green paint sliding ominously down the wall  spoofing blood  to a character s slow mo dives  flips  and machine gun fire calling up images of the matrix and scarface. an attention to visual humor will wring out a lot of laughs.   adjust and play with your props. making a fantasy spoof  try changing the emblems on the shields or coat of arms to something ridiculous or funny.don t be afraid to  steal  famous shots and do something funny with them.  airplane   begins with the plane cutting through the clouds set to the music from jaws  re creating the shot in a new light.  this seems counter intuitive  but remember the old rule of  tragedy   time   comedy.  if you put your characters in somewhat legitimate danger  introduce real consequences  and live in the world you re spoofing  then it will be that much funnier when everything blows up in the character s faces. a good spoof still respects and pays attention to the classics  and is a better movie for it.   while any movie in this article could fit this step  sean of the dead is a particularly good example. it actually owns up the horror elements in a few key scenes  playing like a traditional zombie movie  which leads to an enormously funny and satisfying payoff in the end.  comedy  in general  is a quick moving art form  as surprise and speed are key to getting laughs and stringing them together. spoofs are often even faster because they rarely have original plots that the audience needs to think of. try to keep the jokes rolling quickly    if one fails  there is another one right behind it    and let the plot stay simple.   most spoofs are on the shorter end  usually 90 100 minutes  as there is always a danger of the movie overstaying its welcome if it doesn t have anything original to say.

stencil. spray the paint on using a long  sweeping motion. don t worry if the paint is not thick enough. you can always do another layer or two.   consider spraying the design using clear sealer

query	16	love that movie braveheart hardcore dance  if you want to help open the crowd up then find some people around you who are into dancing and tell them you want to hardcore dance. everyone should gather in a group and when the music starts begin pushing people out of the way by walking backwards with your arms extended. this is the more polite way to do it  and there are many other ways such as running as fast as you can at the people around you and jumping toward them.    someone around you is going to know what they are doing  so just watch and see what everyone else is doing. don t try to rip off peoples moves though  as this could get you tackled for being a rook. just try to make sure you re not doing the wrong thing at the wrong time.    this move is performed by taking your right leg and swinging it in front of your left  and then respectively pulling your left leg out from behind your right and throwing it in front 2 steps vary from city to city . if you re doing it right  and many beginners don t   you will have a running in place like effect going for you. you should try to move your arms to the beat as well  maybe by grabbing the air near your feet. since hardcore dancing is done at hardcore shows making a gangsta limp hand or other similar things is not recommended seeing as most of the people there will not like rap or hip hop.    swing your arms around with a closed fist back and forth in front of your body  perhaps balancing yourself on one foot and switching now and then or planting your feet and bending your knees. it helps add to the effect if you appear as though you have no absolutely no concern for the well being or safety of anyone around you. this is usually referred to as  the windmill .    as long as it goes with the flow of the music and is particularly violent in nature  it may be accepted in the circle. you can also try some other trademark moves like  picking up the change   which is performed by standing with your feet shoulder length apart and brutally punching downwards at the ground. this can also be performed instead by punching the sky or air that is directly in front of you.    put your fist up in the air and start walking across the circle  and throw it down just as the music starts again  then proceed with step 4. sometimes this sudden pause is the queue for a wall of death. that is where the crowd parts into two sides and slams into each other like in the movie braveheart  this move is also called such . if you are in the circle  and the crowd appears to be shifting  move to one side or you will be trampled unless you join the fray.  
query	17	give fives give me five play yahtzee  in yahtzee  scores are kept on a sheet of paper containing a column of 13 boxes. on each turn  you must choose which box to fill in based on your best scoring option. if you are unable to enter a score  or choose not to  you must enter a  0  in one of your boxes. each box can be filled in only once.    the upper section boxes are scored differently than the lower section boxes. your goal  in the upper section  is to score at least a 63. if you have 63 points or more in the upper section  you get a 35 point bonus at the end of the game.   the upper section contains six boxes labeled aces  ones   twos  threes  fours  fives  and sixes. you roll 5 dice in yahtzee. to fill in the upper box  you combine the values on the dice with the same number. then  you add the number to the appropriate box. you can only choose one box to fill in with each turn.this can be confusing when discussed in the abstract. let s look at an example. say you roll the dice and you score two fives and three twos. as you have two fives  you could enter a score of 10 in the fives box. you have three twos  so you could also enter a total of six in the twos box. you have to choose which number you want to enter.    you want to get at least a 63 to get the bonus  so choose wisely. in our above example  you might be inclined to score in the fives box  as this is a higher score  but be careful. you can only fill in each box once. if you get four fives on your next roll  you miss out on a much higher score in that box.  the lower section scores are more complicated. instead of simply listing numbers  phrases like  three of a kind  and  full house  are written in the lower section. these are different combinations of dice that are all scored differently. take some time to familiarize yourself with the lower section scores before playing yahtzee.    one value you can score in the lower section is a three of a kind. to score a three of a kind  you have to roll three of the same dice.   with a three of a kind  you add all the values of your dice together. this gives you your total score for the three of a kind box. this can be confusing. let s look at an example to clarify. say you rolled three fives  a two  and a four. this could be scored as a three of a kind. you would multiply five by three to get the value 15. then  you would add two and four. this would give you a total score of 21  which you would write in the three of a kind box.  a four of a kind is similar to a three of a kind. you can score in this box if you get four of the same dice in one roll. then  you would score it by combining the values of all the dice. for example  if you roll four twos and a six  you can score a 14 in the four of a kind box.  a full house is worth 25 points regardless of dice values. a full house is made up of three dice of one number and two dice of another number. for example  say you roll three 6 s and two 5 s. this could be scored for 25 points as a full house.  small or large straights are scored when you roll dice in numerical order. for example  you roll a one  a two  a three  a four  and a five. a large straight is worth more points than a small straight.   a small straight includes four dice in a numerical sequence. for example  say you score a one  a three  a four  a five  and a six. you could score this as a small straight. a small straight is automatically worth 30 points.a large straight includes five dice that move in a numerical sequence. for example  if you score a two  a three  a four  a five  and a six  this would be a large straight. a large straight is worth 40 points.  a yahtzee is one of the highest rolls you can score. a yahtzee occurs when all five dice are the same number. a yahtzee is worth 50 points the first time  regardless of dice value. additional yahtzees are worth 100 points.   if you roll a yahtzee after having already filled in the yahtzee space  you get a 100 point bonus.  in the event you re unable to score in any other box  use the chance box. you can score any combination of dice in the chance box by totaling their numbers.   for example  say you roll two threes and three sixes. two times three is 6. three times six is 18. you would add 18 and 6 to get 24. you could then write 24 in the chance box.  at the end of the game  you calculate your score. whoever scores highest wins.   add the upper section scores together and write the total in the  total score  section. if you score 63 or over  add a bonus of 35 points. total the scores in the lower section as well  adding 100 points if you scored any additional yahtzees in the game. then  add the upper and lower score together to figure out your grand total for the game.  you can play yahtzee in a group of at least 2 players. if you have a big group  you can play in teams. to start the game  you first need to figure out who goes first. to do so  each player or team rolls all 5 dice. you would add all the values of the dice together. the player or team with the highest score goes first.  you can roll your dice up to 3 times in a game of yahtzee. yahtzee comes with a cup or shaker in which you place the dice  shake  and then spill them on the table. as you roll  you can strategize to try to maximize your score. in any roll  you can choose to keep some dice and re roll others. to start  roll all five dice.to help understand the process  let s look at an example. say you roll a one  a three  a four  a five  and a six. you have a small straight with the three  four  five  and six. this would come to 30 points. however  if you re roll the one and get a two  you would have a large straight. this means 40 points.  if you re happy with your initial score  you can add your score to your card and complete your turn. however  you can also try for a higher score. choose which dice you want to keep and which you want to re roll.   in our above example  it would make the most sense to re roll the one. this way  you have a chance at a large straight. say you roll the one and get a three. you still do not have a large straight. however  you can roll the dice for a third time to try again.    if you re still unhappy with your score  you can roll the dice one more time. once again  you can re roll as many dice as you want.   in our above example  say you re roll the three you rolled in your second turn. if you get a 2  you can score it as a large straight. however  if you get another number you can still score it as a small straight. you can also fill in one box in the upper level.    every player rolls the dice 3 times each for 13 rounds. as you go  you need to try to fill in all your boxes. each box can only be filled in once  so make wise choices in terms of how you choose to count your scores.    yahtzee is a game of both strategy and chance. there are steps you can take to maximize your chance at a yahtzee each round. remember  after your first yahtzee  each additional yahtzee earns you 100 points.   early in the game  anytime you have a chance for a yahtzee  take it over settling for a lower score. the earlier you score a yahtzee  the better. this maximizes your chance at the 100 point bonus.if you already have a yahtzee  never settle for lower scores over the chance at getting a second yahtzee. for example  don t score three 4 s and two 2 s as a full house. instead  re roll the 2 s to try for a second yahtzee.  trying to decide where to score your round can sometimes be confusing. however  keeping the 35 point bonus in mind can help you strategize.   higher scores with lower numbers  like the one and two boxes  are rare. it s to your advantage to score in the upper section if you roll a high number of twos or ones. for example  say you roll four twos  a five  and a six. you can score a 6 in either the two or six box. however  you should aim to score in the 2 box. the highest you can score in the two box would be an 8 or 10. the highest you can score in the six box  conversely  is a 30 or a 36. you don t want to fill up the six box with a low score.    you do not want a  0  score in any of the lower boxes. these boxes have the potential for high point values. therefore  aim to get straights early on so you can then concentrating on going for yahtzees. be on the lookout for combinations like  two  three  four  or  four  five  six.  re roll the dice as needed to get a straight early in the game.  a yahtzee is fairly rare  even with good strategy. if the score is tight  it s late in the game  and you have not scored a yahtzee yet  it might be worth it to score high yahtzees in the upper section. this usually guarantees you ll get the bonus  which may mean a higher score. for example  five sixes plus the 35 point bonus leaves you with 65 points. a yahtzee is only worth 50.however  keep in mind if you score another yahtzee you risk getting 50 points as opposed to the 100 point bonus.

query	21	prepare for a shakespeare play shakespeares plays read shakespeare for beginners  if you are able to choose your own play  pick something easy and something you might already be familiar with to start. most editions will have a brief synopsis printed on the back cover. if the play sounds intriguing  it might make for a good selection.   romeo and juliet is often a good starting point because many of us are familiar with the  star crossed lovers  plot. consider a comedy  like taming of the shrew  a play which has been adapted to film for modern audiences. macbeth is another popular shakespearean tragedy  and if you are interested in political intrigue  this might be the play for you.    there are two major choices to make. the first choice is between texts that have been modernized to smooth over the differences in language use from shakespeare s time to our own time  or texts that have not been modernized. the second choice is between texts that are annotated or non annotated. annotated texts may provide definitions  context  and value added information that will help you to form a deeper understanding of what is going on in the play.   the  no fear shakespeare  series is a good option that offers the original text side by side with modernized text. remember that modernized text should support understanding  and not replace the original. popular annotated versions are available by arden and oxford. non annotated texts will provide just the text as it was originally written.    when in doubt  use the context of the sentence to figure out the meaning or reference an online shakespearean glossary. here are some examples     thee  as  you.  for example   when will i see thee next    thou  as  you.  for example   thou art a villain.   thy as  your.  for example   thy name is more hateful than thy face.   hath  as  has.  for example   he hath killed many a man.  or  he hath a horse.  in shakespeare s writing  parts of speech are frequently switched and  normal  sentence order is often varied  often for the sake of rhyme or meter  which is like rhythm . shakespeare often played with standard language  some common features include    nouns or adjectives used as verbs verbs and subjects which don t agree omitted or implied words word endings such as   ly  applied inconsistently tricky sentence construction.  for instance  where we say  john caught the ball   shakespeare might write  john the ball caught   or even  the ball john caught.   in shakespeare s writing  metaphors and similes may make some passages more difficult to understand. shakespeare also heavily used puns  double meanings  and malapropisms for comedic effect.   an example of a shakespearean metaphor compares life to the theatre stage   all the world s a stage  and all the men and women merely players. they have their exits and their entrances  and one man in his time plays many parts.  an example of a shakespearean pun  after hamlet has killed polonius and hidden his body  the king asks him where polonius is. hamlet tells him he is at supper    not where he eats  but where he is eaten   meaning that polonius is the supper   for worms. an example of a shakespearean malapropism  officer dogberry said   our watch  sir  have indeed comprehended two auspicious persons   apprehended two suspicious persons .  gather reference resources that you can refer to if you have a question about something you have just read. here are a few examples of potential resources.   a dictionary a tablet to easily access internet reference material links to websites that will help you understand the language. for example  early english grammar sheets  http   homepages.wmich.edu  cooneys tchg lit adv shak.gram.html   shakespeare s language  http   www.bardweb.net language.html   and pronunciation  http   www.renfaire.com language pronunciation.html .  before you start  set aside some time in a quiet area. move through the text slowly  and don t be afraid to use your dictionary or reference materials if you are lost or confused.    you can make your notes on a separate sheet of paper  where you can write general thoughts  questions  or important ideas or plot points. if you own the text  you might want to consider highlighting key phrases or writing notes in pencil in the book. also  consider the following questions.   what are the important main events  which characters are involved in the sub plot and how does the sub plot relate to the chief plot  what is the relationship of characters to each other  what motivates the characters  what is the central point or lesson of the play   do not be discouraged if you must re read passages several times. even literary scholars often return to key lines. each time you read a passage you will gain a deeper understanding of what is going on in the play.  remember that reading the play you ve chosen should be fun. push on through and keep reading. don t let outdated language or references stop you from enjoying the play.    when you are finished with a section  take out a fresh sheet of paper and take some more notes.   write a summary of each scene or act. record questions or thoughts you may have about the scene. record any new words  phrases  and their definitions that you looked up during reading.   discuss the text or an individual scene with your friends. if you are reading on your own  make use of internet discussion boards for feedback. feel free to ask your friends or people on the discussion board the questions that you wrote down in your notes.    shakespeare s plays were written as dramatic literature and were meant to be performed and heard aloud. as a result  reading the play outloud or performing scenes with friends might give you insight that you would have otherwise missed during a quiet reading.  do this after you ve read the play on your own. if you have finished reading one of shakespeare s more popular plays  there is a very good chance it has been produced into a film. there are also a wide variety of shakespeare s plays on audiobook that you can download to your ipod or another device. but remember  modern plays or film adaptations might give different meaning or be shown in a different context than the original play. think about the below questions when you watch the play or film.   how does the performance compare with your perceptions of the play  was there something the actor provided that you did not consider  was there something you would have done differently   after you are done reading  find a plot summary or synopsis. try to find a synopsis that incorporates passages from the play directly into the discussion. these summaries and synopsis will help correct any misunderstanding that you might have after reading the play. alternately  you can read the synopsis before you ve read the text.

query	29	watch movie with english subtitle the incredible hulk add subtitles to a movie  if you current dvd does not have certain subtitles  found under the  settings  or  language  headers on the dvd menu  you will not be able to add them without advanced software and equipment. dvd s are protected and cannot be re written  and your dvd player will not be able to add new languages. your computer  however  is a different beast entirely  and you can add any new subtitles you can find to a movie watched on your computer.   if you re watching on a dvd players  try the  titles  or  subtitle  button on your dvd player s remote.    find the folder or movie file in finder or windows explorer. more likely than not it will be a .mov  .avi  or .mp4 file. luckily  you do not need to adjust the movie file at all  however  you will need to find it and link it to a new subtitle file. subtitle files will usually end in the extension .srt  and are simply the words and the times that each title needs to play during the movie.   you need the movie in it s own file  with the .srt file  for it to read the subtitles. some older subtitle files might end in the extension .sub.  go on your favorite search engine and search for the subtitles in your language. if  for example  you want indonesian subtitles for x men  first class  you might search for  x men  first class indonesian subtitles.  the first site you find is likely good enough  as these files are small and not likely to contain viruses.  download an srt. file from a website such as subscene  moviesubtitles  or yifisubtitles. make sure you avoid any pop ups and only download .srt or .sub files. if you feel unsafe on a site  leave and find another.    if the movie is bestmovieever.avi  your subtitle needs to be written as bestmovieever.srt. find you newly downloaded file wherever you put it  often in the  downloads  folder  and make sure you rename appropriately. the .srt file name must be the same name as the movie.  make a new  dedicated folder for you movie if there isn t one already. place the .srt file in the same folder as your movie. this will automatically link them in most video players.   the easiest video player to use is the free vlc player  which handles most file formats.    after clicking captions  click on  add a caption track  and find your .srt file. make sure that you have  caption track  enabled and not  transcript track.  click the  cc  button when watching your video to enable captions.    subtitles are translations  and as anyone who has ever used google translate can tell you  translations are as much an art form as a science. if you re subtitling the scene itself  there are several considerations you need to come up with for each line    what is the goal of the dialog  regardless of the words they use  what feeling is the character trying to get across  this is your guiding principle when translating. how can you fit the subtitled words within the time the character is speaking  some writers will display a few lines of dialogue at once  starting a little early and ending late to give viewers a chance to read everything. how do you handle slang and figures of speech  they often do not translate well  so you ll have to substitute slang or figurative language from your native language. this  however  requires you to look up the meaning of foreign expressions and slang.  sites like dotsub  amara  and universal subtitler let you see the movie while you write out the subtitles  eventually spitting out an .srt file that fits with your movie. while all subtitling sites work differently  they all follow a similar format    choose when the title starts. write the title out. choose when the title disappears. repeat across the movie  marking  complete  when finished. download the .srt file and place it in the same folder as your movie.  you can write out subtitles by hand if you want though the process is greatly expedited by a program. to do so  open up a text editor like window s notepad or apple s textedit  both free and pre installed   and make sure you know the proper format for a subtitle. before beginning  click  save as  and title it after  yourmovie.srt.  then set the encoding to  ansi  for english subtitles and  utf 8  for non english.then write out your titles. each of the following parts goes on its own line  so hit  enter  after each one     the number of a subtitle. 1 would be the first title  2 the second  etc.  the duration of the subtitle. this is written in the format hours minutes seconds milliseconds     hours minutes seconds milliseconds  example  00 01 20 003     00 01 27 592     the text of the subtitle  this is simply what the title will say.  a blank line. leave one blank line before the number of the next title.  this method lets you see the titles as you add them and adjust their placement  color  and style by hand. open your movie file in your favorite film editor  such as premier  imovie  or windows movie maker  and pull the film into your timeline  the work section . from here  click on your programs  titles  menu and choose a style you like. write out your title  drag it on top of the appropriate section of the film  and repeat.   you can right click on a title and copy and paste it to keep your same settings on every title  saving you tons of time. the only drawback to this format is that the movie will need to be saved as a separate file. you will not be able to turn the titles off  as they will now be part of the movie.

query	32	see the spirits of people who have died the sixth sense catch ghosts  old houses  like 100 or 200 years old  not from the 1970s  1980s  or 1990s  are good places to look for ghosts.   sometimes when a person dies  their spirit will return to the place where they died or a place they can t bear to leave behind  which is often their family home. these spirits are not usually malevolent  unless their death was violent   so household ghosts are a good place to start for the rookie ghost hunter. just be sure to get permission before you go ghost hunting on private property.    cemeteries are another good location for ghost catching  even if they can be a little creepy at night    sometimes  ghosts cannot bear to leave their physical bodies behind after death  while other spirits  particular those who haven t been able to move on  come to visit the graves of their family and friends.    some of the best locations for ghosts are places where large numbers of tragic deaths occurred  such as old schools  prisons  and asylums.   not all schools are haunted  but you may have an old school building in your area where students or teachers died due to tragic accidents like fires or smoke inhalation  this was more common in the days when classrooms were heated by iron stoves .    old prison buildings are places where many prisoners may have died due to old age  illness  murder or the death sentence.   even if prisoners didn t die there  prison may have been a place of intense loneliness  fear and anger for some people  causing their spirits to return there after death.    insane asylums were notorious for their mistreatment of patients  using inhumane treatments such as shock therapy  water submersion and lobotomies and causing much unnecessary pain and suffering for the unfortunate victims. this makes the sites of old insane asylums a prime location for ghosts.   be warned  however    these spirits may be angry and violent  seeking retribution for their poor treatment in life.    sites where a large number of deaths occurred are a popular location for ghosts  especially if those deaths were violent. this makes the locations of former battles  even if they have since been built over  prime ghost hunting territory.    as mentioned already  people who died tragic or violent deaths are more likely to return to our world as spirits.   therefore  if you are familiar with the location of a murder or a tragic accident  such as a car crash  drowning or fatal fall   this could be a good spot to test your ghost hunting prowess.    the most haunted locations in a specific area will depend on the history of each place and the number of paranormal experiences local people have reported.   therefore  it s a good idea to listen to talk to people and do some research in the local library to find out where to look. many cities and towns will have their very own haunted bridge  road or tunnel where decades worth of unusual activity has been reported.  a manual camera is preferable to a digital one as you will have greater control over the exposure  making you more likely to catch a snap of the ghost. the ghost may appear as a blur or streak of light in the developed photograph.   in addition  paranormal activity tends to interfere with the operation of electrical equipment  making a digital camera unreliable.    a camcorder can also be used to catch a glimpse of any unusual shapes or activity at your chosen ghost catching location.   make sure to start recording at the beginning of the session and leave the camcorder running until the end. it will be easier if you set the camcorder on a tripod for the duration of the session. if your camera has a night vision feature make sure to turn it on  as this will make spotting a ghost that much easier.    sometimes a tape recorder will pick up on sounds that you wouldn t normally be able to hear. these sounds will only reveal themselves when you play the tape back.   keep in mind that you may have to slow down or speed up the playback or use headphones in order to make sense of what you re hearing.    an emf  electromagnetic field  detector measures changes or disruptions to surrounding electrical fields  which may indicate the presence of a ghost.   good emf detectors can pick up on disturbances across a wide range of frequencies. emf detectors can be purchased online  for anywhere between  20 and several hundred dollars.    other specialist equipment that may benefit the serious ghost hunter includes    an infrared thermal scanner  which is used to detect hot or cold spots caused by energy sucking ghosts. an air ion counter  which measures the number of positive and negative ions in the air. ghosts are believed to emit a high quantity of positive ions. however  these items are expensive and will require a certain amount of specialist knowledge in order to interpret the results.    in recent years  many ghost hunting phone apps have become available  which claim to do the work of expensive  specialist ghost hunting equipment.   the more advanced apps include emf detectors  audio detectors and evp  electronic voice phenomena  instruments and other ghost detecting capabilities. the reliability of these apps is the subject of heated debate  and many people consider them just scams or jokes. however  if you re not willing to invest in more expensive equipment  you might want to try them out.  aside from relying on electrical equipment  you ll need to be alert to any physical indications that a ghost may be present.   watch out for items falling or moving location  seemingly of their own accord. keep an ear out for unusual and unexplained noises  such as bangs or thumps. pay attention to any sudden changes in temperature  or for general feelings of unease or feeling  spooked .    if you want to lay a troubled spirit to rest  you should use this method.   take a metal container with a tight fitting lid and cover the bottom with a layer of soil taken from hallowed ground  such as a church or cemetery. leave the container open at the location where you found the ghost. the sanctified soil will draw the spirit in. once you have used your ghost detection apparatus to confirm that the spirit has entered the container  slowly and gently replace the lid  then sprinkle a pinch of salt on top. bury the container in hallowed ground.    the candle method is good for trapping pesky spirits who are causing trouble around the home.   take a large glass jar  open the lid and place a candle inside. at midnight  light the candle and place the jar in a central point at the haunted location. the ghost will be attracted by the energy emitted by the burning candle  but this energy will also trap the ghost inside the jar. once you have confirmed the ghost s presence inside the jar  tightly replace the lip. the candle will burn out on its own. keep the jar tightly sealed as long as you wish to hold the ghost captive. if the jar is opened or broken  the spirit will be released and might come to exact revenge on its captor

beat. the  one and two  and  three and four  steps should take about as much time to complete as the  five six.  get some good shag dance music going  while you re at it. here are some favorites    the flame  by fine young cannibals  do you believe  by cher  never make a move too soon  by b.b. king  your heart s in good hands  by al green  mojo boogie  by henry gray      know that the idea of counting is to give your feet a beat to move to. your feet will move with every count  which includes any number you say as well as the word  and.    before you try incorporating the shag dance moves  just step in place. alternate between your left and right foot. repeat until you re comfortable counting the rhythm and alternating feet. in the shag dance  you ll never step with the same foot twice in a row. this is a fluid  not a jerky dance move. think of your forward and backward movement as the movement of a swinging pendulum. avoid having any bounce in your steps and smoothly transition from one step to the other.    this is an important thing to know before you begin to shag dance. think of it as the partners creating a mirror image of each other s steps. if you re at a loss for what to do and have a knowledgeable partner who is facing you  just mirror his or her footsteps.   women should always do the same step as the men but with the opposite foot. women  therefore  should lead with the right foot. as you start to move your feet  remember that your lower body should do most of the work for this particular dance. keep your upper body upright and tall and avoid swaying. both men and women should wear leather bottomed shoes  with the women wearing flats  to prevent them from shuffling across the floor.    the man and woman should stand facing each other. men and women should keep their feet lose and relaxed  standing so that they are facing each other  with their feet opposite each other with about an arm s length of space in between them.the man should hold the woman s right hand with his left hand. he should hold her hand fairly firmly  without gripping her too tightly  to lead the woman. the forearm of the hands that are holding each other should be level with the floor  and should not sway from side to side or move up or down  either. the pair should keep the non holding arm in a relaxed  but slightly forward hanging position.    the step should be no longer than the length of his foot. as he does this  the woman should step forward with her right foot.   this step occurs on the  one  beat.    as he does this  the woman should step forward with her left foot. think of it as stepping up to a line  having your feet meet in the same place  so that they are evenly positioned on the ground.   this step occurs on the  and  beat. from your original starting position  it is as if you simply stepped up one  space.     this foot should now be in its original starting position. as the man steps back his left foot  the woman should step back her right foot to its starting position.   this step occurs on the  two  beat.    think of it as moving the right foot the length of two feet  so that it is positioned one  foot  behind the left foot. the woman should step her left foot back one foot length behind her right foot.   the step occurs on the  three  beat.    he can also take a small step in place  but he should make sure not to move his foot forwards or backwards. the woman should shift her weight onto her right foot  making sure not to move forward or backwards  either.   this steps occurs on the second  and  beat.    the man should do the same thing he did with his left foot  taking care not to move forward or backwards as he shifts the weight. as he does this  the woman should shift her weight on her left foot.   this steps occurs on the  four  beat.    his left foot and right should now be parallel  as if he had stepped up to meet a line  stepping one full  space  back from his original starting position. as he does this  the woman should step her right foot back to meet her left foot.   this step occurs on the  five  beat.    the foot will now be one foot s length in front of the left foot. as he does this  the woman should step forward with her left foot.   this steps occurs on the  six  beat.    as he does this  the woman should step her right foot forward  repeating her first step.   this occurs during the new  one  beat.    keep counting and moving your feet in the same way to the beat. as you get more experienced  you can get a bit more creative with your body movements by moving in a circle as you face your partner  having the man spin the female partner  taking more exaggerated steps  or by putting some more arm movements into the mix.the female partner can also spin on her own to add some flair to the dance. though the traditional hand position is for the pair to hold opposite hands with the other hands free  the man can place his hand on the small of the woman s back during the dance  or just during part of the dance  too. one partner can even dance behind the other  still holding hands while facing that partner s back.

there are 4 stages of change according to the transtheoretical model of behavior change.identifying which stage you are in can help you determine whether you are ready to make a change or if you need more motivation.    pre contemplation stage  this stage is when there is a problem but you are not aware of it or you are denying it. nobody is perfect  everyone has flaws and needs to constantly work on them. if you don t admit your flaws courageously  you would block any possibility of improvement   contemplation  you are aware of a problem and are contemplating changing it. people can become stuck on this step for a long time until they move on.you may be in this stage if you are still deciding what to change about yourself. or maybe you are afraid of change  in that case  understand that changing is an essential part of growth which you should embrace.  preparation  you have committed to change and are making a plan of action. you may be in this stage if you are working on your goals.  action  making the changes. you are in this stage if you are working on your plan on a daily basis. you have a plan and are currently moving toward your goal.  maintenance  you have completed your goal and are maintaining your progress.    self coaching or checking in with yourself on a daily basis has been linked to increases in self improvement  especially in terms of leadership qualities.daily check ins facilitate awareness of your current performance and your ability to achieve goals.   ask yourself questions like   did i focus on or work toward my goals today  did i have a positive attitude today  was i kind to myself today  did i accept my challenges today  did i change something for the better today      if you find that self coaching is not helping and you need some outside support  life coaching has been associated with positive change  and goal realization.additionally  therapists and psychologists are typically trained in interventions to assist you in

the changed you .   remind yourself about your specific goals on a daily basis.    if change moved vertically  we d all have an easier time making personal modifications. the truth is  change does not typically follow a distinct path and there may be rocks in the road.   for example  in weight loss it is not common for someone to continue to lose weight every single day. some days you may not lose any weight  and some days you may gain some weight. the key is not letting these inevitable fluctuations cause you to give up on your goal. what is important is that overall  you lose weight over time. know that you can do anything you put your mind to  that is reasonable of course   make a list of possible setbacks that may occur during your journey toward self improvement. identify ways to deal with each setback.    dwelling on what you did wrong does not help you achieve goals. however  focusing on what you can do now and in the future helps you to. instead of letting the rock in your path stop your journey  focus on moving forward and learning how to better deal with rocks in the future. you can go around or jump over the rocks.   for example  if you wanted to lose weight and ending up gaining a pound over the weekend  instead of thinking negatively and giving up on your goal  think something like   it s okay to have a little fluctuation in weight. i m going to continue to feed my body healthy foods   unlike what most people think  failure is not evil per se. it is a bad thing in the short run  but it is actually helpful in the long run  that depends on you. so don t fear failure and simply consider them as a potential foundation of a new understanding and strength. there is a reason great people failed a lot.    research indicates that individuals who accept their challenges can actually be more motivated toward positive change.additionally  individuals who affirm or validate themselves often are more able to think about and understand their challenges.recognize your strengths and your challenges  even if you have to list all of them down. understand yourself as an outside observer.try to objectively look at yourself by observing your behaviors such as how you act  speak  and think around other people. assess yourself and what you do regularly. allocate a time for this at the weekends. some do that before going to bed every night. see what areas need improvement  and find out how to improve that  then write it down and read that everyday you wake up in the coming week until it is fixed.

online  but the one at hindibhasha.com is widely recommended by university language departments.    nouns are words for objects  places  emotions  animals  and people. in hindi  all nouns have a gender  masculine  m  or feminine  f . the gender of hindi nouns is essential for proper grammar and communication  so when learning hindi nouns  you must also learn their genders so you can use the nouns correctly.a very general rule to determine the gender for a noun is words that end with the vowel   aa are usually masculine and words that end with the vowel   ee are usually feminine. however  there are many exceptions to this rule  so it s important to still learn the gender of every noun through memorization and practice.for example  the noun for boy is        larkaa  m  and the noun for girl is        larkee  f . so in the case of these nouns  the general rule of gender applies. on the other hand  nouns like      kelaa   banana  m  and      mez   desk  f  or    ghar   house  m  are all exceptions to the general rule of gender.    simple pronouns like  he  she  i  we  they  are key to communicating in any language  including hindi. the pronouns in hindi are first person singular      main   i first person plural     ham   we second person singular     too   you  intimate  second person plural      tum   you  informal      aap   you  formal   a note on informal and formal pronouns  each pronoun is used based on the level of politeness in a conversation. use the formal    aap when meeting someone for the first time  talking to someone older than you or simply to show respect to the person you are addressing. use the informal     tum when chatting with your friends or close relatives. use    too when you are in a very informal or intimate conversation  such as talking to your partner or to young children. it would be considered extremely rude in hindi to use    too when talking to a stranger or someone you barely know.   third person singular     yah   he   she  it   this third person plural     vah   he   she  it   that  in spoken hindi these words are pronounced slightly differently     is pronounced yeh and    is pronounced voh. use    yeh when talking about someone or something close to you  so if someone is standing right next to you  use    yeh. use    voh when talking about someone or something further away  so if someone is standing on the other side of the street  use    voh. when in doubt  use    voh.   third person plural     ye   these   they third person plural     ve  those   they  you will often hear    ve being pronounced as the singular  voh . the third person plural pronouns follow the same rules     ye for people   things close to you  in the distance sense  and    vo for people   things further away. note that both    yeh or    voh could mean either  he  or  she   so there is no difference based on the gender of how you are talking to. you must rely on the context of the sentence to determine if a person is talking to a  he  or  she .      verbs describe an action  occurrence  or state of being. learn hindi verbs in the infinitive form  in english   to        as verbs are conjugated by dropping the infinitive ending and adding other suffixes. hindi infinitives end in    naa.examples of hindi infinitives include       honaa   to be        pahrnaa   to read or to study        bolnaa   to speak        seekhnaa   to learn       jaanaa   to go.  like nouns  verbs in hindi must be conjugated to reflect grammatical categories such as number  gender  tense  and mood.for example  the infinitive verb      honaa  to be  conjugated for number becomes           main hoon   i am        ham hain   we are       too hai   you are  intimate         tum ho    you are  informal         aap hain   you are  formal        yah hai   he she this is       voh hai   he she that is        ye hain   these they are        ve hain   those they are   there are three conjugations for gender in the present verb tense   for masculine singular subjects  drop the infinitive ending    naa and add    taa. for masculine plural subjects  drop the infinitive ending    naa and add    te. for feminine singular or feminine plural subjects  drop the infinitive ending    naa and add    tee.   because hindi verbs have many tenses  you ll want to use a textbook or other reference materials to learn verb conjugations beyond the basic present tense. a good reference dictionary will also help you conjugate new verbs.    once you become more comfortable with hindi nouns  pronouns  and verbs  you can move on to studying other

query	40	win emmy law & order: special victims unit evict a tenant in illinois  under illinois law a tenant s failure to pay rent within five days of the payment due date is sufficient grounds for eviction. the violation of any specific conditions of the lease can also give rise to grounds for eviction. for example  if the lease agreement has a no pet clause  the tenant s decision to keep a dog at the rented property would constitute proper grounds for eviction.   a tenant s refusal to vacate the premises following the expiration of the lease is also a lawful ground for eviction.    before commencing the eviction process you should attempt to talk with your tenant in order to hopefully resolve the issue without resorting to the courts system. ask the tenant whether they just need a little extra time to get caught up on rent past due. it may even be a good idea to explain the reason why their acts constitute a violation of the lease agreement  in order to remedy the grounds for eviction. this way you can avoid the costs associated with commencing the eviction process  while also avoiding having to exert the time and costs associated with locating a new tenant.   if you reach any agreements during this informal discussion  you should make sure to get the details of the resulting agreement in writing.    send a letter to the tenant reminding them of the different conditions of their lease agreement  and explain how specific violations could give rise to eviction proceedings. state clearly that you expect all of the conditions of the lease agreement to be strictly followed  and should this not occur  you have the right to commence eviction proceeding.    there is a very specific process that you must follow in order to properly evict a tenant under illinois law. your first step is to send a notice that describes the premises  ie.the address of the property and the unit number   and requests that the tenant immediately pays the amount of rent past due at the time that notice is given. there are 3 types of notice of eviction that are allowed under illinois law a 5 day notice of eviction is only allowed for failure to pay rent. the tenant will then have 5 days to pay his or her rent or vacate the property. a 10 day notice of eviction is issued to tenants who violate the terms of the lease through actions such as having unauthorized pets or committing illegal activities in the rental unit. in most  but not all areas of illinois  the tenant does not have the right to remedy the situation and must leave after 10 days. a 30 day notice of eviction may be used by a landlord to terminate a month to month or oral lease for any or no reason.    lawfully evicting a tenant under illinois law requires delivering proper service of process to the tenant. you have a couple of options for properly delivering the notice  you can either hand deliver the notice to the tenant or someone who is at the rental unit that is at least 13 years old. leave the notice on the ground in front of the tenant in cases where the tenant refuses to accept it. send the notice via certified mail with a return receipt requested. post the notice on the door of the rental unit if nobody appears to be living there.    the affidavit of service is an official document stating that you have delivered the notice of eviction to the tenant. check with your local eviction court for specific affidavit of service procedures that must be followed.    complaints can be filed with the county clerk s office in the county that the rental unit is located in. visit the county clerk s office in order to access the proper complaint documentation. there will be a filing fee. check with the county clerk s office for the amount to be paid. after paying the filing fee you will be given a copy of the complaint and a summons  which will include a court date that you and the tenant must attend. you then must take the summons to the relevant sheriff s office. upon receipt of the summons  the sheriff will deliver the summons to appear in court to the tenant.    bring a copy of the notice of eviction  an affidavit of service  a copy of the complaint  a copy of the summons  and any witnesses or evidence that you have. explain to the judge why the tenant should be evicted. the judge will issue a decision after you and the tenant have each presented your case.   if you win the case  the tenant will typically be required to vacate the rental unit within 14 to 21 days. if the tenant wins  he or she may use the rental unit until the end of his or her lease term.

before graduating  then is switched to the left side during tassel change. your ceremony s organizers will give you more information on details like tassel change at your graduation rehearsal.    give yourself plenty of time to get ready on the big day  and be on time or early for all graduation related ceremonies. if graduation is being held somewhere other than your school  familiarize yourself with the ceremony s location and parking situation.showing up late is a sign of disrespect to your peers  your school  and yourself. even more important than showing respect  being late will just stress you out and make you even more anxious.    set yourself up for success so you ll be nice and relaxed when you receive your diploma. make sure you have your outfit and shoes picked out at least a day or two before graduation day. keep any tassels  cords  or medallions with your cap and gown.   make sure the clothes and shoes you choose match the graduation ceremony s dress code. hang up your

the actual presenter  and practice walking up and shaking hands.   if you ve received your gown in advance  try practicing with your gown and with whatever shoes you re wearing to become more comfortable walking.    some graduates pump their fists while they re on stage or grab the diploma without shaking the presenter s hand.being on stage is certainly a proud moment  and it s the conclusion to years of hard work. however  this type of celebrating is disrespectful  distracts from other graduates  and takes away from the prestige of the graduation ceremony. there will be plenty of time to jump for joy later.   remember  the title of the song played at many graduations is  pomp and circumstance   which implies that the ceremony involves dignity  formality  and tradition.  before and after receiving your diploma  allow your friends and fellow students to have their own proud moments. don t be a distraction  and don t applaud or shout out to your friends when they cross the stage. the person who announces the names of the graduates will most likely direct the audience to withhold applause until the end  so you should respectfully follow suit.    some graduation ceremonies include hat throwing or drop confetti. that s when you can scream  shout  and jump for joy. be proud of yourself and your accomplishments  and breathe a big sigh of relief.   if you don t want to have to search for your cap after tossing it  you can always just wave your cap in the air. keep your diploma on hand after the ceremony to take photos with your friends and family. while you re celebrating  make sure to keep your diploma in good condition  especially if you receive the actual copy at the ceremony. don t lose it  and keep it safe so you can proudly display it in a prominent place when you get home.

weaponry used. this confrontation involved the european axis powers  mainly germany and italy  against the soviet union and other allied powers.the eastern front was where the majority of concentration camps were located and  thus  played a major role in the holocaust. the major battles fought on the eastern front include stalingrad and the battles that led to the recapture of kharkov by the soviets.    the western front was the site of many conflicts between germany and other western european countries like denmark  norway  luxembourg  belgium  france  the united kingdom  and the netherlands.the first phase of the war in the western front involved many of these western countries fighting germany in attempts that culminated with the battle of britain. the second phase saw a lot of ground combat between the two sides that began with the landing in normandy and lasted until the german defeat in 1945. the major battles fought on the western front include the normandy d day landing  the battle of the bulge  the battle of britain  and the battle of arnhem.  after the japanese attack on american s military bases at pearl harbor  the us launched a counterstrike against the

query	54	create an anti gravity propulsion system anti-gravity calculate tension in physics  the tension in a given strand of string or rope is a result of the forces pulling on the rope from either end. as a reminder  force   mass   acceleration. assuming the rope is stretched tightly  any change in acceleration or mass in objects the rope is supporting will cause a change in tension in the rope. don t forget the constant acceleration due to gravity   even if a system is at rest  its components are subject to this force. we can think of a tension in a given rope as t    m   g     m   a   where  g  is the acceleration due to gravity of any objects the rope is supporting and  a  is any other acceleration on any objects the rope is supporting.   for the purposes of most physics problems  we assume ideal strings   in other words  that our rope  cable  etc. is thin  massless  and can t be stretched or broken. as an example  let s consider a system where a weight hangs from a wooden beam via a single rope  see picture . neither the weight nor the rope are moving   the entire system is at rest. because of this  we know that  for the weight to be held in equilibrium  the tension force must equal the force of gravity on the weight. in other words  tension  ft    force of gravity  fg    m   g.  assuming a 10 kg weight  then  the tension force is 10 kg   9.8 m s2   98 newtons.       gravity isn t the only force that can affect the tension in a rope   so can any force related to acceleration of an object the rope is attached to. if  for instance  a suspended object is being accelerated by a force on the rope or cable  the acceleration force  mass   acceleration  is added to the tension caused by the weight of the object.   let s say that  in our example of the 10 kg weight suspended by a rope  that  instead of being fixed to a wooden beam  the rope is actually being used to pull the weight upwards at an acceleration of 1 m s2. in this case  we must account for the acceleration on the weight as well as the force of gravity by solving as follows   ft   fg   m   a ft   98   10 kg   1 m s2  ft   108 newtons.       an object being rotated around a central point via a rope  like a pendulum  exerts strain on the rope caused by centripetal force. centripetal force is the added tension force the rope exerts by  pulling  inward to keep an object moving in its arc and not in a straight line. the faster the object is moving  the greater the centripetal force. centripetal force  fc  is equal to m   v2 r where  m  is mass   v  is velocity  and  r  is the radius of the circle that contains the arc of the object s motion.   since the direction and magnitude of centripetal force changes as the object on the rope moves and changes speeds  so does the total tension in the rope  which always pulls parallel to the rope towards the central point. remember also that the force of gravity is constantly acting on the object in a downward direction. so  if an object is being spun or swung vertically  total tension is greatest at the bottom of the arc  for a pendulum  this is called the equilibrium point  when the object is moving fastest and least at the top of the arc when it is moving slowest. let s say in our example problem that our object is no longer accelerating upwards but instead is swinging like a pendulum. we ll say that our rope is 1.5 meters  4.9 ft  long and that our weight is moving at 2 m s when it passes through the bottom of its swing. if we want to calculate tension at the bottom of the arc when it s highest  we would first recognize that the tension due to gravity at this point is the same as when the weight was held motionless   98 newtons.to find the additional centripetal force  we would solve as follows   fc   m   v2 r fc   10   22 1.5 fc  10   2.67   26.7 newtons. so  our the total tension would be 98   26.7   124.7 newtons.       as noted above  both the direction and magnitude of centripetal force change as an object swings. however  though the force of gravity remains constant  the tension resulting from gravity also changes. when a swinging object isn t at the bottom of its arc  its equilibrium point   gravity is pulling directly downward  but tension is pulling up at an angle. because of this  tension only has to counteract part of the force due to gravity  rather than its entirety.   breaking gravitational force up into two vectors can help you visualize this concept. at any given point in the arc of a vertically swinging object  the rope forms an angle     with the line through the equilibrium point and the central point of rotation. as the pendulum swings  gravitational force  m   g  can be broken up into two vectors   mgsin    acting tangent to the arc in the direction of the equilibrium point and mgcos    acting parallel to the tension force in the opposite direction. tension only has to counter mgcos      the force pulling against it   not the entire gravitational force  except at the equilibrium point  when these are equal . let s say that when our pendulum forms an angle of 15 degrees with the vertical  it s moving 1.5 m s. we would find tension by solving as follows   tension due to gravity  tg    98cos 15    98 0.96    94.08 newtons centripetal force  fc    10   1.52 1.5   10   1.5   15 newtons total tension   tg   fc   94.08   15   109.08 newtons.       any object being pulled by a rope that experiences a  drag  force from friction against another object  or fluid  transfers this force to the tension in the rope. force from friction between two objects is calculated as it would be in any other situation   via the following equation  force due to friction  usually written fr     mu n  where mu is the friction coefficient between the two objects and n is the normal force between the two objects  or the force with which they are pressing into each other. note that static friction   the friction that results when trying to put a stationary object into motion   is different than kinetic friction   the friction that results when trying to keep a moving object in motion.   let s say that our 10 kg weight is no longer being swung but is now being dragged horizontally along the ground by our rope. let s say that the ground has a kinetic friction coefficient of 0.5 and that our weight is moving at a constant velocity but that we want to accelerate it at 1 m s2. this new problem presents two important changes   first  we no longer have to calculate tension due to gravity because our rope isn t supporting the weight against its force. second  we have to account for tension caused by friction  as well as that caused by accelerating the weight s mass. we would solve as follows   normal force  n    10 kg   9.8  acceleration from gravity    98 n force from kinetic friction  fr    0.5   98 n   49 newtons force from acceleration  fa    10 kg   1 m s2   10 newtons total tension   fr   fa   49   10   59 newtons.       pulleys are simple machines consisting of a suspended disk that allows the tension force in a rope to change direction. in a simple pulley configuration  the rope or cable runs from a suspended weight up to the pulley  then down to another  creating 2 lengths of rope or cable strands. however  the tension in both sections of rope is equal  even if both ends of the rope are being pulled by forces of different magnitudes. for a system of two masses hanging from a vertical pulley  tension equals 2g m1  m2   m2 m1   where  g  is the acceleration of gravity   m1  is the mass of object 1  and  m2  is the mass of object 2.   note that  usually  physics problems assume ideal pulleys   massless  frictionless pulleys that can t break  deform  or become separated from the ceiling  rope  etc. that supports them. let s say we have two weights hanging vertically from a pulley in parallel strands. weight 1 has a mass of 10 kg  while weight 2 has a mass of 5 kg. in this case  we would find tension as follows   t   2g m1  m2   m2 m1  t   2 9.8  10  5   5   10  t   19.6 50   15  t   980 15 t   65.33 newtons.    note that  because one weight is heavier than the other  all other things being equal  this system will begin to accelerate  with the 10 kg moving downward and the 5 kg weight moving upward.    pulleys are often used to direct tension in a direction other than up or down. if  for instance  a weight is suspended vertically from one end of the rope while the other end is attached to a second weight on a diagonal slope  the non parallel pulley system takes the shape of a triangle with points at the first weight  the second weight  and the pulley. in this case  the tension in the rope is affected both by the force of gravity on the weight and by the component of the pulling force that s parallel to the diagonal section of rope.  let s say we have a system with a 10 kg weight  m1  hanging vertically connected by a pulley to a 5 kg weight  m2  on a 60 degree ramp  assume the ramp is frictionless .to find the tension in the rope  it s easiest to find equations for the forces accelerating the weights first. proceed as follows   the hanging weight is heavier and we re not dealing with friction  so we know it will accelerate downward. the tension in the rope is pulling up on it  though  so it s accelerating due to the net force f   m1 g    t  or 10 9.8    t   98   t. we know the weight on the ramp will accelerate up the ramp. since the ramp is frictionless  we know that the tension is pulling it up the ramp and only its own weight is pulling it down. the component of the force pulling it down the ramp is given by sin     so  in our case  we can say that it s accelerating up the ramp due to the net force f   t   m2 g sin 60    t   5 9.8  .87    t   42.63. acceleration of the two weights are the same  thus we have  98   t  m1    t   42.63   m2. after a little trivial work to solve this equation  finally we have t   60.96 newton.      finally  let s consider an object hanging from a  y shaped  system of ropes   two ropes are attached to the ceiling  which meet at a central point from which a weight hangs by a third rope. the tension in the third rope is obvious   it s simply tension resulting from the gravitational force  or m g . the tensions in the other two ropes are different and must add up to equal the gravitational force in the upward vertical direction and to equal zero in either horizontal direction  assuming the system is at rest. the tension in the ropes is affected both by the mass of the hanging weight and by the angle at which each rope meets the ceiling.   let s say in our y shaped system that the bottom weight has a mass of 10 kg and that the two upper ropes meet the ceiling at 30 degrees and 60 degrees respectively. if we want to find the tension in each of the upper ropes  we ll need to consider each tension s vertical and horizontal components. nonetheless  in this example  the two ropes happens to be perpendicular to each other  making it easy for us to calculate according to the definitions of trigonometric functions as follows   the ratio between t1 or t2 and t   m g  is equal to the sine of the angle between each supporting rope and the ceiling. for t1  sin 30    0.5  while for t2  sin 60    0.87 multiply the tension in the lower rope  t   mg  by the sine of each angle to find t1 and t2. t1   .5   m g    .5   10 9.8    49 newtons.  t2   .87   m g    .87   10 9.8    85.26 newtons.

query	60	say belief develop your own beliefs  it can take time to become aware of the beliefs that drive your life. you can more effectively do this by backing off from others for a time. if you want to develop your own beliefs  you will need some distance from others so that you can more adequately tune into your own mind.   take a weekend getaway to a quiet place where you can think. or  if you can t afford a vacation right now  simply isolate yourself at home or in your room for a day or so.    the development of beliefs doesn t happen consciously. therefore  if you wish to form your own  you will need to bring consciousness to those that already guide your life. you can audit your current belief system by training yourself to pay close attention to the relationship between your thoughts and actions. use the abc model.a stands for the activating event. example  your professor scolds you for submitting an assignment late. b stands for the belief. example  you think   i can t do anything right.  c stands for the consequence  or subsequent actions . example  you don t try as hard to get things turned in on time.    tuning into your thoughts and their underlying beliefs is like a muscle the more you use it  the more it grows. journaling is a great way to recognize your thought patterns. begin a free writing practice each day in which you simply write down whatever is on your mind. once you have dumped out all those thoughts  review what you wrote.train yourself to find the thoughts and core beliefs that drive your behaviors.    previously  when you had no awareness of your thoughts  many negative beliefs went unchallenged. take the time to challenge your interpretation of various belief systems. ask yourself whether your core beliefs are helpful and rational. discard the beliefs that do not positively influence your life.for instance  you believe   i can t do anything right.  such a belief certainly does not serve your life. you can search for other possible explanations behind it  like  i need to work harder  or  i need to develop better time management skills.  by challenging and reframing beliefs like this  you can ensure that your current belief system is positive and growth oriented.    one of the most powerful ways to expand your worldview and develop your own beliefs is by seeing new places. oftentimes  your pre existing belief system is built around your own narrow experience. when you see the world beyond your own community  your experience broadens  and so do your beliefs.plan to explore as much as you can. depending on your budget  this might include visiting new states  countries  or continents. however  you don t have to travel far to get a new perspective. consider taking a foreign culture course at your local college or visiting a museum in your area.    when you engage with people who are different than you  you can learn more about their belief system. in turn  you may better inform yourself on what beliefs suit you best. strike up a conversation with someone whose background is different than your own.they could have an alternative political perspective  be from a different culture  or have been raised with a unique lifestyle. if you are too nervous to chat with others  you might start out reading books about people who lead different lifestyles.    exploring new activities and ways of being can push you out of your comfort zone. as a result  you may develop new beliefs about yourself and the world around you.   challenge yourself to learn a new skill like salsa dancing. learn another language. eat in a foreign restaurant. include different colors or prints in your wardrobe than usual.  many people s belief systems are grounded in moral decisions of right and wrong. you can empower your own belief system by experimenting with different spiritual practices or religious beliefs.visit a different church or place of worship. start a meditation practice. or  spend more time in nature. this might be challenging if the ideas are drastically different from what you were raised to believe. take your exploration slowly by finding small ways to explore  e.g. reading a book versus attending a worship service  until you feel more comfortable.    after you have reviewed your pre existing beliefs and explored alternatives  it can help to try to define your personal values. an important part of developing a belief system is figuring out what you stand for  and your values are basically the causes you consider important.   you can pinpoint your personal values by reflecting on times when you felt the happiest  most proud or satisfied. what was happening during these times  try to label the factors that contributed to these feelings.in addition to reflection exercises  you can also complete a values inventory like the personal values assessment.  a big part of establishing your own belief system is making your ideas known to others. each time you share your beliefs with someone else  you affirm them. also  you can make your position clear with others who try to influence your beliefs.for instance  if your belief system has changed from that of family or friends  you might inform them. say something like   well  actually my views on that have changed   then  briefly share your new position. when you share your beliefs with others  avoid doing so defensively. simply speak with polite confidence.    if your new belief system is drastically different than that of your family members or friends  your disclosure may be met unfavorably. prepare yourself for negative reactions  but don t allow their disapproval to make you doubt your decisions. remember that everyone is entitled to their own beliefs  even if those closest to you don t agree.a good way to respond is with open mindedness and honesty. you might say   i know this may come as a shock to you. but i m happy to answer any questions you have.  give them  and yourself  time to come to terms with a change in beliefs. over time  your loved ones may come to support your beliefs  or at least not actively oppose them.    once you have confirmed your new belief system  regularly audit your everyday actions to be sure they are in line with your beliefs. you are happiest when your daily actions and choices support your core values and beliefs. plus  when you live by your beliefs  you are able to be your most authentic self.  even after you have developed your own belief system  expect it to morph over time. as you travel  learn new things  meet new people  and have new life experiences  your perspective on various beliefs will likely change. this is completely normal  and okay.

query	70	watch history of television watch less tv  at some point in recent history  it became popular to put televisions in every room of the house. but having access to tv everywhere you turn only leads to unnecessary viewing. limit your tv watching to one room of your house to reduce temptation and ultimately watch less tv.  using a television recording device  like tivo or dvr  can allow you to save the tv shows that you like. having your favorite tv shows saved will reduce the time you spend aimlessly browsing and flipping channels  causing you to watch less tv.  keeping your tv in a cabinet  with a door that closes  or simply placing a tapestry over it when it is not in use can lead to a reduction in your tv time. when you can t see the tv  you are much less likely to turn it on.  many people today are ditching their cable in favor of internet television services  like netflix or hulu. once again  this practice eliminates the ability to mindlessly flip channels and leads to less time in front of the tv.  if you make it more difficult for yourself to watch tv  it gives you a better opportunity to exercise some willpower. one way to achieve this is to unplug your tv when it s not in use. keeping your tv plugged in actually wastes quite a bit of energy  so pulling the plug is also a great choice for your pocketbook and the earth.  you have probably heard that the first step to tackling a problem is to admit that you have one. if you suspect that you might be watching too much television  take a week to prove it. for one week  watch as much television as you normally do  but keep a log. at the end of the week add it up  and astonish yourself with how much time you ve been wasting in front of the screen.once you have your weekly amount  think about all the other things you could have done with that time. it could have been 10 hours studying  15 hours at the gym  or 20 hours practicing guitar.    one popular tactic is to allow yourself only a certain number of hours  or minutes  of tv time per day. start by limiting yourself to one hour per day. then  once you are comfortable with that amount  maybe try to do half an hour per day  or one hour every other day.  rather than simply giving yourself tv time each day  for free   you may want to use tv as a reward. for example  if you work out for 45 minutes  maybe this earns you 45 minutes of tv time. if you finish that letter you ve been meaning to write  maybe this earns you another 15. this way  you re still getting your hour to unwind in front of the tv  but you ve also completed some important tasks in the process.you may want to create a list that details the number of tv minutes certain tasks are worth. you may still want to enforce a daily cap  such as 1 2 hours .    eating in front of the television is an addicting habit. not only has this been shown to have negative effects on your waistline  but it encourages longer and more frequent tv watching. break the habit  focus on eating your food when its time to eat  and pay close attention to the tv when it is time for tv.  you can use any trick in the book  but ultimately your choice to watch less tv is going to come down to willpower. willpower is like a muscle  the more you exercise it  the stronger it becomes. watching less television is an important lifestyle adjustment that can have very positive benefits for you. try to be strong and follow the goals you have set for yourself.  exercise seems to be the answer to everything  right  well studies have actually shown that people who exercise regularly have a lowered desire to watch tv  so not only will getting active distract you and give you something else to do  but if you commit to do doing it regularly  it will lessen your tv addiction.  it is common for people to flip on the television anytime that they feel lonely. if you find yourself in this position  turn off the tv and phone a friend instead. that conversation will definitely be more uplifting and better at countering feelings of loneliness than another episode of mad men.    if you and the people you live with are huddled up around the tv every night  try changing the scene and pull out some board games. board games can be a lot of fun for people of all ages. depending on the game  they encourage interaction  cooperation  strategy  critical thinking  and having a sense of humor. start up a game and then look around  you are sure to see a room full of smiles.  if you really craving some form of passive entertainment  try listening to a podcast. podcasts exist on almost any subject and in a variety of genres  comedy  storytelling  non fiction  etc.  but listening to podcasts still helps you reduce your screen time. best of all  podcasts are totally portable  you can tune in from your car  the bus  or walking down the street.find podcasts through a podcast app  the itunes store  or through a basic internet search.    if you really have the itch to take in some audio visual entertainment  take yourself to the movies instead of lounging on the couch. going to the movies is a great way to get out of the house  it s a fun activity to do on a date or with a friend  and it creates a much more immersive experience than watching tv at home. plus  a movie is presented in a limited quantity  you ll only watch those 90  or so  minutes  and then you ll be done.

query	71	work acupuncture find a licensed acupuncturist  most individual u.s. states regulate acupuncture licensing  but these states typically work with the national certification commission for acupuncture and oriental medicine  nccaom  to determine eligibility for licensure.   nccaom is the only nationally recognized certification granted to acupuncturists  but having the certification does not necessarily mean someone is a licensed acupuncturist. acupuncturists are usually required to pass nccaom exams to be licensed  but in addition to this exam  the specific state the acupuncturist will be practicing in might have additional licensure requirements.currently  43 u.s. states as well as the district of columbia work with the nccaom to assess and regulate acupuncture licensure.california administers its own exam  the california licensing examination  to grant licensure to acupuncturists.    licensed acupuncturists attend and graduate from nationally accredited colleges of acupuncture. this education is usually at a master s level  takes 3 to 4 years to complete  and is supervised by experienced and qualified acupuncturists. acupuncturists to become licensed  the national certification commission for acupuncture and oriental medicine requires that applicants attend a program accredited by the accreditation commission for acupuncture and oriental medicine  acaom . there are about 60 of these accredited programs in the u.s.to maintain their license  acupuncturists must also complete continuing education courses. even after completing coursework and graduating from a program  most states also require that applicants for licensure pass nccaom certification exams on topics such as acupuncture with point location  chinese herbology  and oriental medicine. state requirements vary as to which nccaom exams or how many different nccaom exams a person must pass before being granted licensure.    in addition to taking courses at an accredited college of acupuncture  acupuncturists must complete extensive hands on training before they are granted licenses to practice.licensed acupuncturists complete at least 1500 to 2000 hours of training as part of their educational program. before being granted licensure  acupuncturists are required to have seen and treated at least 250 actual patients.    when trying to locate a licensed acupuncturist  you might encounter medical professionals who perform acupuncture or claim they are certified in acupuncture. this designation is often used by physicians  chiropractors  physical therapists  and dentists who employ acupuncture techniques in their fields  but this does not necessarily mean they have the level of training and experience as licensed acupuncturists.in comparison to licensed acupuncturists  individuals claiming they are certified in acupuncture usually complete 100 to 300 hours of training. the certification is typically granted by a professional organization in the individual s field such as the american academy of medical acupuncture  the national acupuncture detoxification association  or the international veterinary acupuncture society.certified acupuncturists are not required to pass nccaom exams. certified acupuncturists often do not have as much hands on experience with patients before being granted certification. certified acupuncturists are not required to complete continuing education courses.    regulations on acupuncture licensing vary among states. before you start looking for a licensed acupuncturist  familiarize yourself with the specific requirements in your area.   the nccaom maintains a database of these requirements  which is available through their website.  one of the easiest ways to locate a licensed acupuncturist in your area is to use the search engine or registry provided on the national certification commission for acupuncture   oriental medicine  nccaom  website.keep in mind that the nccaom registry only includes practitioners who elect to make their information available through the registry. this means that it is possible for an acupuncturist to be licensed but not appear in the registry. if someone you know recommended a specific acupuncturist  you can use the nccaom website to verify their licensure or contact the organization by phone or email to confirm they are licensed.    your physician has likely referred patients to a licensed acupuncturists in the past  and should be able to recommend one.even if you receive a recommendation from your physician or another medical professional  it s a good idea to use the other steps in this article to verify the individual is a licensed acupuncturist and make sure their licensing is up to date.    an acupuncturist may be certified through the national certification commission for acupuncture and oriental medicine  but not licensed through the state they are located in. as a result  it s a good idea to contact your state s acupuncture board to verify whether an acupuncturist is licensed to practice in your area.  another helpful way to find a licensed acupuncturist is to research patient ratings and reviews online. these will often provide insight into whether an acupuncturist is licensed  but also provide you with invaluable information about their bedside manner and skills.   contact an organization like the better business bureau  either online or by phone  to see how other patients rate this acupuncturist. while patient reviews can be helpful  don t rely on them exclusively. instead  use them in conjunction with the other methods discussed in the article so you can be confident that someone is a licensed acupuncturist.    to get a more detailed review of a licensed acupuncturist  ask the office for a current or past patient referral.   many offices are prepared for these requests and will try to provide the contact information of a patient with a condition similar to yours that the acupuncturist treated. if the office declines the request because of privacy concerns  don t be alarmed. you want to work with an acupuncturist who is professional and will respect patient privacy.    before you schedule an appointment or procedure with a specific acupuncturist  verify again that the acupuncturist is board certified by the nccaom and that their certification and license are up to date.   your state s acupuncture board or the acupuncturists  office should have no problem confirming this information.    not all insurance providers cover acupuncture treatments and not all acupuncturists accept insurance  so talk with your insurance provider and the acupuncturists  office staff before setting up an appointment. these details might influence which licensed acupuncturist you ultimately decide to work with  so here are a few questions to ask in advance how many treatments will the insurance carrier provide  what will your copay for a visit to a licensed acupuncturist be  does the insurance company require a referral from a physician  what conditions are covered for acupuncture  some insurance companies only cover acupuncture for pain relief. does the insurance provider have specific requirements about who can provide the acupuncture  how will the acupuncturist deal with insurance  for example  they might want to be paid in full up front  and recommend that you file a claim for reimbursement with your insurance provider on your own.    it s important to meet with the acupuncture practitioner you are thinking of working with before proceeding with any treatment. this will provide you with another opportunity to verify that they have appropriate credentials  but also give you a chance to assess whether you feel comfortable working with this individual.   if you don t want to schedule a formal appointment at this stage  contact the office and see if there is a time you might be available to meet with the acupuncturist for a few minutes. if you schedule a more formal initial visit  ask the acupuncturist about the steps involved in treatment  how much relief you might expect it to provide  and how much it would cost.    though all licensed acupuncturists are required to understand general practice  some specialize in certain fields such as fertility or dermatology. if you would like to work with an acupuncturist who specializes in a specific field  take this into consideration when researching licensed acupuncturists.   if the acupuncturist has a website or is featured on one  their online profile might describe his or her areas of interest or specialty. if you re uncertain whether you need a specialist  you can always see a general acupuncturist first and discuss whether your treatment requires a specialist.    like with any medical professional  it can take time to find the right acupuncturist for you and your needs. if you are not comfortable with the practitioner you selected or have concerns that the treatment is not working  you can reconsider your options and get a second opinion from a different licensed acupuncturist or other medical professional.  
query	72	improve apgar score read an apgar score  even though apgar refers to the designer s name  it can also be used as an acronym   apgar  can stand for appearance  skin color   pulse  grimace response  reflexes   activity  muscle tone   and respiration. this test is used to measure the overall well being of the baby by looking at the major indicators of wellness.  the first category is appearance. in this part of the test  the medical staff will look at the baby s skin color. the skin color can indicate whether the baby is receiving enough oxygen or not.a zero in this category means the baby is blue all over. a one means the baby is mostly a healthy color but may be bluish at the hands and feet. a two means the baby is a healthy color all over  including pink at the hands and feet.    the next category on the apgar test is heart rate. a nurse  doctor  or midwife will check for the baby s heartbeat. the medical staff will also determine the pulse rate to see how the baby is thriving.if the baby doesn t have a heart rate  the score is zero. a score of one indicates a heart rate under 100 beats per minute  which is not quite as fast as it should be. a score of two indicates the baby s heart rate is over 100  which means the baby is thriving in this particular category.    the grimace response is how the baby reacts to mild stimulus. for instance  the baby may be lightly pinched to see if the baby responds a lot or if it doesn t respond at all to the stimulus.a zero indicates no response. a one means the baby pulls a face  grimaces  but doesn t sneeze or cough. a two means the baby pulls a face and either cries  pulls away  sneezes  or coughs in response.    next comes a check of muscle tone. muscle tone just measures the baby s activity to see if it is moving around on its own. an active baby indicates that they are doing well.a zero indicates the baby is limp or not moving much at all. if the baby is given a one  it means they are moving with smaller or less active motions  but they are not as vigorous as the doctor would prefer. a two means the baby is actively moving around.    the last category on the apgar test is breathing. a person on the medical staff examines the baby to see how they re breathing  then assigns a number to the breathing effort from zero to two based on what they observe.a zero means the baby is not breathing  while a one means the baby has irregular breathing. a two means is the baby is breathing just fine  which usually means the baby is both breathing and crying with normal effort and at a normal rate.    the score from the apgar is generally taken as a whole rather than in individual categories. in other words  all the scores from each category are added together to get one number. the best possible score is ten  which means the baby is doing as well as they can be. however  most babies don t score a ten at birth.a score from seven to ten means the baby will just need standard care. if the score is under seven  the baby will need more monitoring and possibly interventions  such as help breathing.  while a low score may seem scary  it usually doesn t mean the baby will have long term health effect. rather  it just means the baby needs a little extra care right after birth to help stabilize their health.certain factors can cause the apgar score to be lower. often  it s caused by a c section  premature birth  or a birth that s a bit more difficult than other births. a low score can also be caused by fluid in the airway.    if the baby has a low score  generally one of two things will happen. with the first intervention  the baby s airway will be cleared out if it has fluid  and the baby will be given oxygen. a second option is the baby may be given stimulation to get the heart beating more rapidly.keep in mind that if these basic interventions do not work  the medical team will do whatever is necessary to improve the baby s condition. this can vary based on the causes of the score.    generally  the baby will be placed somewhere warm while the test is performed. that can either be on a parent s belly or under a warmer. keeping the baby warm is important.  as the name implies  the one minute test is performed a minute after the baby leaves the mother s body. it tells the medical staff how well the baby did during the birthing process and accesses the baby s need for assistance.  the five minute test  as it sounds  is given five minutes after birth. this test is the same as the one minute test  but it s given to measure how the baby is doing out in the world  out of the womb .this test also helps evaluate whether any interventions are working.  while the test is usually just performed twice  it may be given a third time if the baby has a low score. usually  it s given at the ten minute mark to see if the baby has improved any from the five minute test.
query	73	relieve asthma treat asthma  you and your doctor should work together to create a plan that describes the use of your asthma medications  your triggers and how to avoid them  as well as what to do when your asthma is flaring.everyone will have a different action plan as everyone experiences asthma differently.for instance  if the person suffering from asthma is a student  his action plan would include permission to take his medicine at school.the action plan should include emergency phone numbers  a list of triggers to avoid  flare up symptoms and what to do when they appear  plus how to prepare before exercise so you don t have an attack.    medication is usually the foundation of asthma treatment. medication prescribed by your doctor can help keep the disease under control and prevent asthma attacks.there are two types of oral and inhaled asthma medication your doctor may prescribe  and most people take both at the same time    anti inflammatories that reduce swelling and mucus in your airways. this can make breathing easier. bronchodilators that relax the muscles around your airways to improve breathing rate and the amount of oxygen in your lungs.  oral or inhaled medications that control inflammation can be the most important for a person with asthma. they reduce swelling and mucus in your airways and can help control or prevent asthma symptoms if taken daily.your doctor might prescribe an inhaled corticosteroid such as fluticasone  budesonide  ciclesonide  or mometasone.it may take daily use over a longer period of time for these medications to have their full effect and they come with few side effects.your doctor may prescribe leukotriene modifier such as montelukast  zafirlukast  or zileuton to help prevent and relieve symptoms for up to 24 hours.use these drugs carefully  however  as they are linked to psychological reactions including agitation and aggression.fortunately  these reactions are rare. your doctor may also give you a mast cell stabilizer such as cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium.for severe symptoms not controlled by other methods  your doctor may prescribe short or long courses of oral steroids. these have more possible side effects  so are only used when other treatments aren t effective or when acute symptoms are severe.    bronchodilators come as short  or long term medications. short term bronchodilators  which are often called rescue inhalers  relieve or stop symptoms and can help during attacks.long term bronchodilators help control symptoms and prevent attacks.for some people  pre treating with medication before exercise can reduce asthma symptoms caused by exercise. your doctor might prescribe a long acting beta agonist such as salmeterol or formoterol.these can open your airways  but may also increase your risk of a severe asthma attack. you will usually take them with a corticosteroid.you may also use a combination inhaler such as fluticasone salmeterol  or mometasone formoterol.ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic drug that can help control acute or new asthma symptoms. theophylline is a long acting bronchodilator which is rarely used for asthma anymore except in certain situations.    studies have shown that allergy medications can alleviate asthma symptoms  especially if they are a result of allergies.talk to your doctor about taking allergy meds for asthma.allergy shots may decrease your body s reaction to allergens over the long term.nasal steroids such as fluticasone may reduce allergy symptoms and thus reduce asthma triggers. oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine  cetirizine  loratadine  and fexofenadine may reduce or relieve your asthma symptoms. your doctor can prescribe or recommend an antihistamine for you.    this treatment  which uses heat to limit the ability of airways to tighten  is not widely available. speak to your doctor about bronchial thermoplasty if you have severe asthma that doesn t improve with other treatments.bronchial therapy requires that you undergo three outpatient hospital visits.the treatment heats the insides of your airways  which reduces the amount of smooth muscle that can contract and limit your air intake.the results of bronchial thermoplasty last for up to a year  which means you may need repeat treatments in subsequent years.  asthma is often worse following exposure to environmental factors that trigger symptoms. limiting or avoiding triggers can minimize your symptoms or prevent attacks.add avoid exposure to very hot or cold weather. cover your face if you are out in the cold or wind. keep your immunizations up to date  especially a yearly flu shot  to reduce infections that can trigger an asthma attack. avoid smoking and secondhand smoke if you have asthma  as smoke is a significant trigger of asthma symptoms. use an air conditioner to reduce airborne pollen circulating indoors. reduce the dust in your home through daily vacuuming or removing carpeting. cover mattress  pillows  and box springs in a dust proof cover if you are allergic to pets  keep them out of the house  or at least out of your room. clean regularly to remove dust  pet dander  mold spores and pollen.avoid exposure to pollens or air pollution by limiting the time you spend outside.reduce psychological stress.  keep yourself healthy with diet  exercise  and regular doctor s visit to help relieve symptoms of asthma. conditions like obesity and heart disease may exacerbate or cause asthma.exercise regularly to strengthen your heart and lungs. this may also help manage your weight.eat a healthy  balanced  and regular diet. consuming recommended daily amounts of fruits and vegetables may even help lung function and reduce asthma symptoms.  there is some evidence that heartburn and gerd  or gastroesophageal reflux disease  may damage airways and make asthma worse. speak to your doctor and treat both conditions  which may help any symptoms of asthma you experience.  there is some evidence that using deep breathing exercises in conjunction with medication can help control symptoms and reduce how much medication you need.it can also relax you  which may relieve psychological stress that exacerbates asthma.   deep breathing helps distribute oxygen in your body. this can reduce your heart rate  normalize your pulse  and relax you  all of which may help control asthma.inhale and exhale completely through your nose. you may want to breathe to a specific count. for example  you can inhale to a count of four and then exhale for the same number.to optimize your deep breathing  sit upright with your shoulders back. breathe slowly and evenly  pulling in your belly to expand your lungs and rib cage.  some studies have shown that herbal and natural remedies may help control asthma. speak to your doctor before using these remedies.look for products containing black seed  caffeine  choline  and pycnogenol  as these may help relieve asthma symptoms.mix three parts tincture of lobelia with one part tincture of capsicum. take twenty drops of this mixture in water to help a severe asthma attack.eat ginger and turmeric  which may help decrease inflammation.  doctors don t know what causes asthma  but they are aware that certain factors increase your risk for the disease.learning whether you are at risk for asthma can help you identify symptoms and get treatment.risk factors include having a blood relative with asthma having allergic conditions like atopic dermatitis or allergic rhinitis being overweight being a smoker or exposing someone else or yourself to secondhand smoke working with or being exposed to exhaust fumes or other pollutants    asthma has a variety of signs and symptoms ranging from mild to severe. recognizing potential symptoms have can help you get proper treatment.some of the symptoms of asthma include shortness of breath tightness or pain in the chest sleeping difficulties coughing  especially with exercise  acute attacks  or during the night whistling or wheezing sounds when breathing    if your think you might have asthma  see your doctor. if she thinks you may have asthma  she may order tests after examining you. the following kinds of tests may be the only way to confirm asthma spirometry  which examines how much your bronchial tubes narrow and how much air you can exhale after a deep breath. peak flow meter tracking  to determine your ability to exhale.methacholine challenge  which uses an asthma trigger to see if you have asthma. nitric oxide testing to measure the amount of nitric oxide in your breath  which can confirm asthma.scans like x ray  ct  or and mri to look at the tissues of your lungs and nose cavities that can make asthma worse. allergy tests sputum eosinophils  to look for the presence of certain types of white blood cell called eosinophils.  depending on the results of your tests  your doctor may confirm a diagnosis of asthma. speak to her about the best treatment for your specific case.  
query	74	treat back pain treat spondylosis  cold therapy reduces swelling by causing a decrease in the diameter of blood vessels  vasoconstriction . it can also numb deep pain. cold therapy can be applied using cold packs  bags of ice  cold rags  or bags of frozen vegetables or fruit.do not use ice packs or other cold therapy methods on the area for more than 15 to 20 minutes at a time. always place a towel between the skin and the cold source. refrain from using topical pain relievers at the same time you are applying cold. do not use cold therapy if you have poor circulation.    heat therapy increases the diameter of blood vessels  vasodilation   which increases circulation. it also reduces muscle spasms and alters the sensation of pain. heat therapy can be applied using heat packs  heating pads  or hot water bottles  or soaking a washcloth in warm water and applying to affected area.you can also soak in a hot bath or shower. do not use heat therapy for more than 15 to 20 minutes. put a cloth between the skin and the heat source. do not use topical pain relievers at the same time you are applying heat. test the temperature to avoid burns. avoid hot tubs or spas if you have high blood pressure or heart disease.    taking it easy and getting bed rest for a few days can be helpful in some cases of severe pain due to spondylosis  however  any bed rest should be restricted to no more than one to three days  because any longer may prolong recovery.long term bed rest also increases an individual s risk for deep vein thrombosis  dvt   or a blood clot in the lower extremities. a dvt can lead to a pulmonary embolus  pe   or a blood clot in the lungs  which can be life threatening.    regular exercise  even if modified during a painful episode of spondylosis  can help speed recovery. it is recommended to continue normal or near normal activities. low impact exercises  such as walking or swimming  are good choices. yoga is a good form of exercise too. it s been noted that individuals who walk daily are less likely to experience neck or low back pain.in addition to thirty minutes of cardio exercise three times a week  you should do core exercises  such as pelvic lifts. this helps strengthen the core to support the spine. you should always talk to your physiotherapist before starting a new exercise. you and your physiotherapist can come up with an exercise routine that will be right for your specific condition.    temporary bracing may help relieve the pain of spondylosis. make sure not to wear it any longer than one week. bracing allows muscles to rest. long term bracing is discouraged since it can weaken muscles and lead to more pain in the neck or low back.you can obtain a soft neck brace from a pharmacy or doctor.    sleeping with a firm pillow below the neck or between the legs may help relieve the pain of spondylosis  especially if your pain is in the mid to lower back. special pillows have been developed for the cervical spine or neck  which offer additional support that may help relieve pain. the pillow changes the direction of your spine  giving it added support and keeping it straighter while you rest.there are special pillows designed for this function  but if you cannot locate one of these pillows  simply use the fullest pillow on your bed.    lifestyle modification may be helpful for the spine at any age. consider less strenuous work if your work entails an overabundance of bending or heavy lifting. if you are overweight or obese  losing weight can reduce stress on the spine. quitting smoking can improve bone health  especially in the spine.you should also consider your posture. if you slouch while sitting or standing  put more effort into correcting your posture and keeping your back and neck straight.    the pain and other symptoms of spondylosis  whether acute or chronic  can be treated with home methods. generally  the pain caused by spondylosis frequently improves after a few days. one good way to treat the pain is to use over the counter pain relievers.examples of otc meds that help with this condition include non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  nsaids   such as aspirin  bayer  ecotrin   ibuprofen  motrin  advil   and naproxen  aleve . acetaminophen  tylenol  is another medicine that may also be helpful as a pain reliever. acetaminophen is a safer option for individuals with a history of asthma  high blood pressure  liver disease  heart disease  or stomach ulcers.    topical pain relievers can complement or be used an alternative to oral pain relievers. they can be administered in multiple ways  such as in creams  foams  gels  roll ons  sprays  and sticks. the most common ingredients found in this class of medication are counterirritants. examples of counterirritants include camphor  menthol  and methyl salicylate  oil of wintergreen . they work by creating a cooling or burning sensation that distracts an individual s mind away from the pain. popular brands include bengay  icyhot  and tiger balm. capsaicin. capsaicin is obtained from chili peppers and has been found to be very effective for topical pain relief. it causes a tingling or burning sensation upon the skin and may take several days before it actually relieves pain. popular brands include capzasin and zostrix. salicylates. salicylates give aspirin its pain relieving qualities. they may be absorbed into the skin for local pain relief. a popular brand of topical salicylate is aspercreme.    there are several varieties of prescription strength pain medications that your doctor may give you to treat the pain associated with this condition when non prescription drugs are no longer sufficient. your doctor may prescribe prescription strength nsaids that will reduce any inflammation associated with spondylosis.popular prescription nsaids include diclofenac  voltaren   meloxicam  mobic   nabumetone  relafen   etodolac  lodine   and oxaprozin  daypro . common side effects of nsaids may include dizziness  headache  nausea  diarrhea  and excess gas. caution should be used if taking nsaids for longer than one week  as prolonged use increases the risk of stomach ulcers  kidney damage  and heart attacks.  muscle relaxants may be prescribed to treat muscle spasm associated with spondylosis. popular muscle relaxants include carisoprodol  soma   cyclobenzaprine  flexeril   methocarbamol  robaxin   and metaxalone  skelaxin .common side effects of muscle relaxants may include drowsiness  dizziness  dry mouth  and difficulty urinating. the use of muscle relaxants should be restricted to short term due to their high risk for dependence or addiction.    depending on your level of pain  your doctor may choose to prescribe a narcotic pain medicine. commonly prescribed narcotic pain medications include codeine  hydrocodone  and oxycodone.   common side effects of this class of medication may include drowsiness  constipation  dry mouth  and difficulty urinating. narcotic pain medications should not be mixed with alcohol or other medications containing acetaminophen  tylenol   as the combination can greatly increase the risk of liver damage. use of narcotic pain medications should be curtailed to less than two weeks  because of the increased risks of tolerance  dependence  and addiction.  medications originally used to treat seizures  or epilepsy  have been found to be helpful in the treatment of chronic pain. low doses of antidepressants have been used for years to treat chronic neck and back pain. spondylosis can in a minority of cases lead to chronic neck or back pain.the most commonly prescribed anti seizure medications used to treat chronic pain are gabapentin  neurontin  and pregabalin  lyrica . it remains unclear how these medications control pain. drowsiness and weight gain are common side effects of gabapentin. common side effects of pregabalin may include drowsiness  dizziness  dry mouth  and constipation. commonly prescribed tricyclic antidepressants  tcas  helpful in the treatment of chronic pain include amitriptyline  elavil   imipramine  tofranil   and nortriptyline  pamelor . duloxetine  cymbalta  is a novel antidepressant used in the treatment of chronic pain. both tcas and duloxetine work by increasing levels of the brain neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin  which are instrumental in blocking the transmission of pain signals in the brain. common side effects of these antidepressants may include drowsiness  weight gain  dry mouth  constipation  and difficulty urinating.    an epidural steroid injection  esi  is a minimally invasive procedure that may be used to treat pain caused by spondylosis. the injection is a combination of a long acting steroid  triamcinolone  betamethasone  and an anesthetic agent  lidocaine  bupivacaine . the medications are injected into the epidural space of the spine  which is the area between the protective covering of the spinal cord  dura  and the backbone  vertebra . the duration of pain relief from an esi varies and can last weeks  months  and sometimes even years.it is recommended no more than three esis be performed in a 12 month period because exceeding this limit could weaken the spine. potential complications of esis include infection  bleeding  and nerve damage. types of physicians qualified to administer esis include physiatrists  anesthesiologists  radiologists  neurologists  and surgeons.    the majority of patients suffering from spondylosis do not require spinal surgery. nonsurgical treatment is successful in at least 75 percent of spondylosis cases  but in some instances  surgery does become a necessity. if you begin to experience neurologic deficits  like a loss of bowel or bladder control  surgery will likely be considered your best option. loss of feeling or function in your arms  legs  feet  and fingers can be another sign of such deficits.under these circumstances  a nerve is being pinched or your spinal is being compressed. the underlying damage to your nervous system could worsen if these conditions are not fixed.    spinal decompression surgery is a general term used to describe different surgical procedures that can relieve pressure on the spine. you will need to work with your doctor to determine the best technique for your circumstances.during a laminectomy  bony arches of the spinal canal called lamina are removed  thereby increasing the size of the spinal canal. during a laminoplasty  the lamina are left in place but cut free along one side of your spinal cord. a discectomy is a technique that removes a portion of an intervertebral disc that has previously put pressure on a nerve root or on the spinal canal. with both the foraminotomy and the foraminectomy  the openings where the nerve roots exit the spinal canal are enlarged by the removal of tissue. you may undergo osteophyte removal  during which bone spurs are physically removed from areas in which they cause pinched nerves. during a corpectomy  a surgeon will remove an entire vertebral body and its discs.    physical therapy  pt  may be prescribed by a physician for long standing neck and back pain secondary to spondylosis. pt may combine passive treatments  such as ice and heat  ultrasound  and electrical stimulation  with therapeutic exercises to stretch and strengthen neck  abdominal  and back muscles.physical therapy is usually prescribed for chronic pain that has lasted for several weeks without responding to other treatments. massage therapy may also be introduced into your physical therapy routine. a professional massage therapist will work on the muscles in your back to soothe and relax them after you have exerted them. the goal of pt is to prevent recurring pain.    spinal manipulation performed by a chiropractor may also help relieve the pain of spondylosis  especially with the first month of pain. it works by realigning vertebrae  which have been misaligned due to weakness in the spine brought on by spondylosis. overall  it is a safe procedure.the most common side effects are generally minor and include fatigue and temporary muscle soreness. extremely rare complications of spinal manipulation may include weakness  loss of feeling in legs or arms  and bowel or bladder problems.    acupuncture is a popular treatment for long standing neck and back pain. acupuncture for spondylosis involves inserting very thin needles  about the size of a human hair  into the neck or back. the needles can be twirled  electrically stimulated  or warmed to augment the results of treatment.it is thought that acupuncture balances the chi of the body  which flows in meridians. an alternative explanation may be that acupuncture causes the release of chemicals that reduce pain and inflammation.  
query	75	develop brain prevent brain cancer  doctors do not know what causes brain in most cases  but there are certain factors that can increase your risk. knowing these factors can help you identify your risk and potential symptoms  and get regular checkups.the main risk factors for brain cancer include age  exposure to radiation  a family history of brain tumors  and currently having cancer that could metastasize  spread  to your brain from another area of your body.the brain  like the liver and lungs  has a lot of blood vessels. if a  seed  of cancer travels from elsewhere in the body  the chances of it settling in these areas with many blood vessels is higher. this is why having cancer elsewhere in your body puts you at elevated risk.    any person  from children to the elderly  can develop brain cancer  however  your risk for the disease increases the older you get.recognizing this and being aware of your body may help you to seek a medical opinion if you notice any symptoms of brain cancer.some brain tumors and cancer  such as brainstem gliomas and astrocytomas  are almost exclusively present in children.  keep a detailed record of your family s medical history  including cases of cancer and tumors. if you have a family history of brain tumors or certain genetic syndromes that increase risk for brain cancer  you are at a higher risk of developing cancer of the brain or surrounding areas.understanding your family medical history of brain cancer can identify potential symptoms and treatment options.   it s always wise to keep a personal record of your family s medical history and to have one at your doctor s office. only 5   10  of all cancers are hereditary.a family history of li fraumeni syndrome  neurofibromatosis  tuberous sclerosis and turcot syndrome may make you more susceptible to brain cancer.  different types of radiation can increase your risk of developing brain cancer. limiting your exposure to radiation may help you prevent developing the disease.ionizing radiation  which is present in some radiation therapies for cancer or atomic bombs  increases your risk of brain cancer. you may not be able to limit your exposure to ionizing radiation if you are undergoing treatment for another cancer. the likelihood of being exposed through an atomic bomb or nuclear meltdown is low.ultraviolet radiation  which the sun emits  can also increase your risk for brain cancer. wearing sunscreen and a head cover and limiting sun exposure may decrease your risk.  people are often exposed to more common forms of radiation including electromagnetic fields or radiofrequency radiation.although some people believe that these types of radiation cause brain cancer  there is no evidence linking them to brain tumors.studies have not linked radiation from power lines  cell phones  smartphones  or microwaves to brain cancer.stay abreast of research on radiation exposure  which may help identify your risk factors.    there is some evidence that nutritional habits during fetal development  childhood and into adulthood may decrease your risk of developing brain cancer. eating plenty of fruits and vegetables and lowering cholesterol may help you prevent brain cancer.if your mother ate fruits and vegetables during her pregnancy and or gave them to you as a part of your diet during childhood  you may be at a lower risk of developing brain cancer.continuing to eat a diet rich in different fruits and vegetables may keep your risk for brain cancer lower.lowering your cholesterol and limiting how much fatty food you eat may minimize your risk for brain cancer.  aim to exercise most days of the week. doing cardiovascular exercise can help you stay healthy and may minimize your risk of developing brain cancer.aim to walk 10 000 steps a day  which translates to walking about 5 miles  or 8 km  per day.wearing a pedometer can help you make sure you re taking enough steps per day. you can do any type of cardio training to maintain your health. beyond walking  consider running  swimming  rowing  or biking.    there are many different symptoms of brain cancer that you may have. the signs and symptoms of a brain tumor can vary significantly. they depend on where in your brain the cancer is and the rate at which it is growing. there are several general signs of brain tumors that may alert you to seek medical treatment.changes in a person s memory  personality  coordination  sensations  motor functions  etc. can be important clues to help locate the tumor. the following are possible signs of brain cancer new headaches or a change in the pattern of your headaches. unexplained nausea or vomiting. vision problems  including blurred vision  double vision or loss of peripheral vision. gradual loss of sensation or movement in your arm or leg. difficulty with balance  speech  or general confusion in everyday matters.    if you have any symptoms of brain cancer  see your doctor as soon as possible. they will confirm a diagnosis and develop a treatment plan  which is the only way to treat brain cancer.your doctor will conduct a neurological exam that looks at your vision  hearing  balance  coordination  strength and reflexes. this may give them clues about whether you have a brain tumor and  if so  what kind.your doctor may order imaging tests such as an mri  ct scan  pet test to look more closely at your brain. this may help identify tumors or cancer.your doctor may take a biopsy of your brain tissue for analysis to assess whether you have brain cancer.there may be other reasons for your symptoms  such as stroke  multiple sclerosis  an infection  or more. this is why it is essential you see a doctor for an evaluation.    if your doctor confirms a diagnosis of brain cancer  they will develop a treatment plan for and with you. the type of treatment depends on what kind of brain cancer you have an how severe it is.your doctor may perform surgery if the cancer is in a spot accessible to remove the tumor.your doctor may prescribe radiation therapy to combat a brain tumor or cancer.you may need chemotherapy to treat brain cancer.your doctor may prescribe targeted

query	76	suffer carpal tunnel syndrome treat carpal tunnel syndrome  the carpal tunnel within your wrist is a narrow passageway made up of small carpal bones and ligaments. the tunnel protects nerves  blood vessels and tendons that go into your hand. the main nerve that innervates your hand is called the median nerve.avoid activities that compress and irritate the median nerve such as repetitively flexing your wrist  lifting heavy weights with your hands  sleeping with bent wrists and punching solid objects.   wearing tight bracelets and watches may be a risk factor also  so make sure to leave ample space. in many cases of carpal tunnel syndrome  a single cause is difficult to identify. often it involves a combination of factors  such as arthritis or diabetes combined with repetitive strain in the wrist. the wrist anatomy of people can make a difference   some have naturally smaller passageways in their wrists or have carpal bones that are positioned oddly.    stretching your wrists on a regular basis can be effective at reducing or minimizing carpal tunnel symptoms.in particular  wrist extensions can help make more room for the median nerve in the carpal tunnel by stretching the ligaments that attach to the carpal bones. the easiest way to extend and stretch both wrists at the same time is the  prayer pose  with your palms together. put your palms together in front of your chest and raise your elbows until you feel a nice stretch in your wrists. hold for 30 seconds and repeat 3 5x daily.   you can also grab the fingers of the affected hand and pull backwards until you feel a stretch at the front of your wrist. you may feel more temporary tingling in your hand with this stretch  but don t stop unless you feel pain. in addition to hand tingling  other symptoms commonly associated with carpal tunnel syndrome are  numbness  throbbing pain  muscle weakness and color changes  too pale or too red . the only part of the wrist   hand typically spared symptoms is the little finger   it s not innervated by the median nerve.    the symptoms of carpal tunnel are often related to having inflammation   swelling in the wrist  which either directly irritates the median nerve or crowds  pinches  it. as such  taking otc non steroidal anti inflammatories  nsaids   such as ibuprofen  motrin  advil  or naproxen  aleve   can be very helpful to reduce symptoms short term.painkillers such as acetaminophen  tylenol  paracetamol  can be used for carpal tunnel also  but they don t impact swelling  only the pain.   anti inflammatories and analgesics should be considered short term strategies for pain control. there isn t any evidence that these drugs improve carpal tunnel syndrome in the long term.taking too many nsaids or taking them for too long significantly increases your risk of stomach irritation  ulcers and kidney failure. taking too much acetaminophen or taking it for too can cause liver damage. as an alternative  rub an ointment that contains a natural pain reliever into your sore wrist   hand. menthol  camphor  arnica and capsaicin are all helpful for relieving mild to moderate pain.    if your wrist is sore and looks or feels swollen  then apply a small bag of crushed ice  or something cold  to it in order to reduce inflammation and numb the pain. doing so may also reduce hand symptoms. cold therapy is most effective for soft tissue injuries that involve some sort of swelling because it reduces blood flow.apply the crushed ice to your wrist for about 5 10 minutes 3 5x daily until the symptoms subside.   compressing the ice against your wrist with a stretchy tensor or ace bandage is even more effective for fighting inflammation. always wrap ice in a thin cloth before applying it skin   it prevents skin irritation or frostbite. if crushed ice isn t available  use a large ice cube  frozen gel pack or small bag of frozen veggies instead. in some cases  cold therapy may aggravate the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. avoid ice if that s the case with you.    wearing a rigid brace or splint that holds your wrist in a neutral position during the day may reduce the compression or irritation of the median nerve and help with carpal tunnel symptoms.splints or wrist braces can also be worn during activities that aggravate symptoms  such as working at the computer  bowling or carrying groceries. wearing splints while you sleep can help relieve nighttime symptoms of tingling and numbness in your hands  especially if you have a habit of curling your wrists.you may need to wear a splint for several weeks  day and night  to get significant relief from carpal tunnel symptoms. for some sufferers  splints and braces provide negligible benefit. splinting at night can be a good idea if you re pregnant and have carpal tunnel syndrome because pregnancy tends to increase swelling  edema  in the hands and feet. wrist splints and braces can be purchased at most pharmacies and medical supply stores.    some sleeping postures can aggravate the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.sleeping with your fists clenched and wrists tucked in  flexed  is the worst position  but having your arms extended above your head is not great either. instead  sleep on your back or side with your arms at your sides  and try to keep your hands open and your wrists in a neutral position. wearing a wrist splint or brace is very helpful in this regard  although it takes a little getting used to.   don t sleep on your stomach with your hands   wrists compressed under your pillow. people who do this frequently wake up with numb and tingly hands. most wrist splints and braces are made of nylon and fasten with velcro  which can irritate other parts of your body. consider covering your splint with a sock or thin cloth to reduce irritating other body parts.    your carpal tunnel problem may be caused or aggravated by a poorly designed work station. if your computer keyboard  mouse  desk and or chair isn t positioned properly for your height and body proportions  it can put strain on your wrists  shoulders  neck and mid back. make sure your keyboard is low enough so that your wrists are not constantly bent upwards while typing.consider getting an ergonomic keyboard and mouse  designed to take the stress off your wrists and hands.   putting cushioned pads underneath your keyboard and mouse can lessen the impact on your hands and wrists. have an occupational therapist review your body positions while performing your job. people who work on computers for many hours each day are at higher risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.  if you are feeling any carpal tunnel symptoms in your wrist and hand that persist for more than a few weeks  then see your doctor for an examination. your doctor may take x rays and blood tests to rule out other causes of wrist   hand pain  such as rheumatoid arthritis  osteoarthritis  advanced diabetes  hairline fractures or vascular problems.   electrodiagnostic studies  emg and nerve conduction  are usually done to confirm the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome.your doctor will see if you can perform certain tasks that are difficult with carpal tunnel syndrome  such as  making a tight fist  pinching your thumb and forefinger together and manipulating small objects with precision.your doctor may ask about your profession  as certain jobs are at high risk  carpenters  cashiers  assembly line workers  musicians  auto mechanics and people who work on computers for long hours.    your doctor may recommend injecting the carpal tunnel area of your wrist with corticosteroid medication  such as cortisone  to relieve the pain  inflammation and other symptoms.corticosteroids are strong and fast acting anti inflammatories that can quickly decrease swelling in your wrist  which relieves pressure on the median nerve. taking oral corticosteroids  by mouth  is another option  but these drugs are not considered as effective as injections and they come with significant side effects.   other common corticosteroid medications used for carpal tunnel syndrome are prednisolone  dexamethasone and triamcinolone. potential complications of corticosteroid injections include local infection  bleeding  tendon weakening  local muscle atrophy and nerve irritation   damage. as such  injections are limited to 2 per year. if corticosteroid injections fail to significantly reduce the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome  then surgery should be considered.    if all other remedies and treatments fail to give you relief  then your doctor will likely recommend carpal tunnel surgery. surgery should be considered as a last resort  although it can completely relieve your symptoms for good with minimal risk  so it should not be considered as a long shot. the goal of surgery is to relieve pressure on the median nerve by cutting the ligament pressing on it.however  carpal tunnel surgery can be performed in two different ways  endoscopic or open surgery.   endoscopic surgery involves uses a telescope like device with a tiny camera on the end  endoscope   which is inserted through a small incision in your wrist or hand. the endoscope can see inside the carpal tunnel and cut the problematic ligament. endoscopic surgery typically results in the least amount of pain and the quickest recovery. open surgery involves making a larger incision in the palm of your hand and over your wrist in order to cut through the problematic ligament  which frees the nerve. surgery risks include  nerve damage  infection and scar tissue formation.    following the surgery  it s done on an outpatient basis   you ll be asked to often elevate your hand above your heart and move your fingers  which reduces swelling and prevents stiffness.mild pain  swelling and stiffness in the palm and wrist can be expected post surgery for up to 6 months  and complete recovery may take a year. for the first 2 4 weeks  you may be required to wear a splint or brace  although using your hand is encouraged.   most people s symptoms get much better after surgery  but recovery is often slow and gradual. on average  hand strength returns to normal 2 months after surgery.carpal tunnel syndrome can occasionally recur  about 10  of the time  and may require additional surgery.  
query	77	identify dna identify a dalmatian  the best way to identify a dalmatian is by looking at the dog s markings. dalmatians are white dogs that have round black or reddish brown spots. ideally the spots should be distributed across the entire body and there should be no large patches.spots are usually smaller on the head  legs  and tail.when dalmatians are born they are completely white in colour and develop spots as they age.    some dalmatians may have dark blue or tricoloured spots. these colour variations are not accepted as the breed standard for dog shows  but they can still be found on some dalmatians. typically tricoloured dalmatians will be white with dark spots  as well as a few brown patches located on the head  legs  chest  and tail.some dalmatians may have large black patches on their coat.    the dalmatian has a short  smooth  and silky coat. when you pet a dalmatian  the top of their head feels velvety.  dalmatians shed considerably throughout the year. brush the dog s hair frequently in order to manage the shedding.  dalmatians are considered a large dog breed with a strong muscular build. the average dalmatian is about 20 24 inches  50 60cm  tall at the shoulders and weighs 48 55 pounds  22 25kg . dalmatians have a deep chest and thin tail. their feet are round with arched toes and the toe nails can be either black or white.in order to measure the height of a dalmatian  use a tape measure and record the distance from the ground to the top of the dog s shoulders.    the head of a dalmatian has a similar width and length and the top is flat. their nose can be black  dark brown  blue or grey and their eyes are brown  blue  or a combination of both.  dalmatians can vary in size based on the individual dog. it is for example  possible to have larger or smaller dalmatians. this is typically a result of environmental and care factors. for instance  a dalmatian that is overfed may appear much larger than the breed standard.    there are a variety of applications available that can identify different dog breeds. in order to use these apps  upload a photo of a dog and the app will identify the breed.for example  try the microsoft application called fetch  these apps are not always 100  accurate  but the dalmatian is fairly easy to identify because of the unique spots.    if you see a dog that you think might be a dalmatian and are curious about the breed  approach the owner and ask. for example  you could say something like  that is a beautiful dog. is it a dalmatian by any chance   alternatively you could say  what kind of dog is that  i really like its colouring.    most dog owners will be happy to tell you about their dog and the breed.    if you are unsure of your dog s breed or lineage  ask your veterinarian to help you identify the breed. veterinarians will be familiar with most dog breeds and will be able to examine the physical characteristics of the dog to help with identifying the breed.    if you are purchasing a dalmatian from a breeder  you should talk with the breeder about the puppy s parentage and lineage to make sure that you are getting a purebred dalmatian. a licensed breeder will be able to provide you with paperwork that proves both parents are recognized as dalmatians by the american kennel club.    search google for a  dog dna test kit.  these kits cost approximately  80 to  100 and can be ordered online.  once you receive the dna test kit in the mail  open the package and carefully read all of the instructions. the instructions will provide you with steps on how to take a dna swab and then how to return the results to the lab for testing.each kit is only designed to test the dna of one dog.    the kit will likely come with two swabs. they are both to be used on the same dog. open your dog s mouth and rub the swab across the inside of the dog s cheek. do the same thing with each of the swabs.  place the swabs into the plastic baggies provided. then place them in the pre paid return envelope or box and mail the results to the lab for testing.  approximately three weeks after you completed the test  you will receive detailed dna results. your dog s dna will be compared to approximately 200 different breeds. if you have a dalmatian  a dna test will easily be able to identify this breed.the results can even test to see if your dog is a mixed breed that is part dalmatian.  
query	78	diagnose hepatitis c diagnose viral hepatitis  the symptoms of acute hepatitis typically begin suddenly and get progressively worse over the course of several days. if you have the following symptoms  see your doctor right away anorexia fatigue fever nausea and or vomiting hives or itchy skin abdominal pain dark urine pale colored stool joint pain jaundice pruritus  itchiness     people with chronic hepatitis b and c often experience no symptoms at all  which makes these conditions much harder to diagnose. if you believe you have been exposed to viral hepatitis  you should see your doctor for testing  even if you feel fine.  for patients who do experience symptoms from chronic hepatitis  fatigue is the most common. if you have chronic fatigue  do not ignore this symptom. see your doctor for blood tests to find out if viral hepatitis is the cause.because chronic fatigue can be caused by many other conditions and is sometimes a side effect of a busy lifestyle  people do not always recognize it as a symptom of hepatitis. this can lead to delayed diagnosis  and ultimately more liver damage. chronic liver disease can lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma  liver cancer . you may need a liver transplantation or medication to control these pathologies.    viral hepatitis is sometimes caught when patients have routine lab work that reveals abnormal liver functioning. if you have lab work done  check with your doctor to find out if your liver tests are normal.if your routine lab work is abnormal  you will most likely be sent for more blood work in order to determine if you have viral hepatitis. the first test to be completed is the measurement of the ast and alt  if these enzymes are elevated then you may possibly have hepatitis. however  there are other possible causes like alcoholism and gall bladder disease.    one test that is commonly used to diagnose hepatitis is a liver enzyme test  also known as the ast and alt test. this is a simple blood test that detects elevated levels of certain liver enzymes in the blood. elevated levels suggest liver damage  which is often caused by viral hepatitis.liver damage may have other causes as well  so elevated liver enzymes do not always indicate a diagnosis of viral hepatitis. people with acute hepatitis are more likely to have extremely high enzyme levels that will subside to normal within a short amount of time  while people with chronic hepatitis are more likely to have slightly elevated enzyme levels that will remain elevated for an extended period of time.    a viral antibody test is another blood test that is commonly used to diagnose viral hepatitis. it detects the antibodies that the body s white blood cells has produced to fight the virus.in patients with acute hepatitis  viral antibodies will still be detectable even after the body has eliminated the virus. patients who have been vaccinated against hepatitis a or b will have antibodies in their blood  but this does not mean the virus is present.for the rest of a patient s life  if they get tested for viral antibodies  and have had hepatitis vaccination  then the test will show surface antigen positivity  especially with the hepatitis b vaccination.    if your blood tests are positive for viral hepatitis antibodies  your doctor may also want to look for evidence of viral proteins and or genetic material in your blood. when these are present along with antibodies  it indicates that the patient s body has not been able to fight off the virus  which may indicate a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis.if your antibody test was positive  but there is no evidence of viral proteins or genetic material  this means your body has successfully eradicated the virus.    viral hepatitis can sometimes be confused with conditions that block the bile ducts  such as gallstones or cancer of the gallbladder. even alcoholics can have unusual levels of enzymes that may need to be ruled out. your doctor may want to do an ultrasound to rule out bile duct blockage as the cause of your symptoms.  if you have tested positive for hepatitis  your doctor may want to do further tests to understand how severe the condition is and what specific type of hepatitis you have. this will help your doctor recommend the best treatment plan for you.   one of these tests is a liver biopsy  which is performed by inserting a long  thin needle through the skin and into the liver. this test measures the amount of liver damage caused by viral hepatitis.if you have been diagnosed with hepatitis c  you may need to have additional tests to identify the virus s genotype. certain genotypes are more responsive to treatment than others  so knowing which type you have will help your doctor develop an appropriate treatment plan.  the following individuals are at a higher risk for contracting hepatitis c people who have had organ transplants or blood transfusions people who have used intravenous drugs people who have had kidney dialysis people who have hiv people who have been incarcerated people who have had tattoos or piercings with dirty needles people who were treated for clotting issues with blood products before 1987 people who were born to mothers with hepatitis c people who have been exposed to the blood of an individual with hepatitis c    like hepatitis c  hepatitis b is transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids of an individual who has the virus. the following people are at a higher risk for getting hepatitis b people who had a blood transfusion or received another blood product prior to 1972 people who have had a tattoo or piercing  if an infected needle was used  people who have used intravenous drugs people who live with people who have hepatitis b people who have had multiple sex partners men who have sex with other men people who have been to areas where hepatitis b is endemic people who were born to a mother with hepatitis b people who work in the healthcare field    unlike hepatitis b and c  hepatitis a is transmitted through feces. people who do any of the following are at an increased risk of contracting hepatitis a drink contaminated water eat raw shellfish that came from contaminated water eat food that has been handled in an unhygienic way by an infected person come into contact with the feces of an infected person

participating in a paired exchange donation  which means you will donate your kidney to a stranger on the condition that a compatible stranger also donates a kidney to your loved one.some kidney transplant centers allow you to be a good samaritan donor  which means you can initiate a chain of donations by donating your kidney to a stranger. when you donate your kidney  the recipient s loved one will donate hers  and so on and so forth. this will probably not directly impact anyone you know personally  but it will help a lot of people. if you don t want to donate your kidney while you are still alive  but you want to help someone after you die  you can register to donate all of your organs or specific organs by signing up on your specific state s registry or indicating your preferences on your driver s license.    once you have decided that you would like to donate a kidney  you must contact a transplant center in order to initiate your application. the transplant center should have a nurse available to answer all of your questions and help you decide if donation is really right for you.if you are donating to a specific person  you must contact the transplant center that has approved them for a transplant. if the person has not yet been approved  you will not be able to proceed with donating your kidney until that happens.if you are not doing a direct donation  you have a choice regarding which facility you work with. contact multiple facilities and ask questions regarding their success rates  their policies for matching donors and recipients  and the financial assistance they offer in order to choose the right one for you. consult the u.s. department of health and human services  organ procurement and transplantation network for a complete list of transplant centers in the united states.  if you want to donate to a specific person  you will need to undergo blood testing to determine if you are a match. the initial screening involves a simple blood test.you must have a compatible blood type in order to donate your kidney to a specific individual. people who have type a blood can accept blood from donors with type a or type o. people with type b blood can receive blood from people with type b or type o. people with type ab blood can receive blood from someone with any blood type. people with type o blood can only receive blood from a donor with type o blood. the antibodies in your blood must also be compatible with those in the recipient s blood. in general  the more antibodies that recipient has  the more difficult it will be to find a match. doctors also consider antigen matching. you do not need to be an exact match in order to donate  but research has found that an exact match does increase the success rate of the transplant. if you have passed all of the other tests  doctors will then perform a cross matching test  which may actually be a series of several tests. doctors will collect cells and serum  blood without the cells in it  from both the donor and the recipient and mix them together to see if the recipient s body is likely to reject the donor s organ. if these tests come back negative  you will be considered a match. keep in mind that if you are not a match for your loved one  you still have the option of participating in a paired exchange donation program  which will greatly increase the chances that your loved one will receive a kidney in a timely fashion.  in order to donate a kidney  you must be healthy enough to undergo surgery and to do well afterward with only one kidney. you also must have a sufficiently low risk of developing kidney problems in the future.your doctor will likely perform blood tests  urine tests  x rays  an ekg  and a ct angiogram to check your overall health and look for any abnormalities of your kidneys.certain chronic conditions  such as diabetes and liver disease  may disqualify you from donating your kidney. if you are a smoker  you will be required to quit at least one month before undergoing surgery to have your kidney removed.you may also be disqualified from donating a kidney if you have certain diseases that could be passed on to the recipient  such as hiv or hepatitis. you will also be required to undergo a psychological examination in order to confirm that you are aware of the risks of donating your kidney and are choosing to do it of your own free will. if you have any health conditions  you might require a pre surgical clearance from your treating doctor in order to be approved for surgery.    donating a kidney requires that you undergo major surgery  and this is not without risks. make sure to talk to your doctor about the risks before you agree to undergo surgery  and always ask if you have an increased risk of complications for any reason. although rare  some risks of surgery include the following bleeding infection blood clots in the lung  pulmonary embolism  death    kidney donors do not usually have shorter lifespans or a diminished quality of life as a result of the surgery.there are  however  some long term risks to keep in mind.   while your body is perfectly capable of functioning normally with only one kidney  you will be at a disadvantage should your remaining kidney fail. if you end up needing a kidney transplant  you will be given preference as a prior donor.kidney donors may have a somewhat higher chance of developing high blood pressure.having only one kidney may prevent you from being eligible for certain military  police  and fire fighting jobs.  most of the time  your medical expenses will be covered by either the recipient s insurance or by the transplant center if you choose to donate a kidney. make sure to find out if you will be responsible for any costs.

nonprofit agency expenses for travel to and from the transplant center childcare lost wages during your recovery period medical expenses related to long term surgical complications    there are two different surgeries your doctor may perform to remove your kidney  an open incision removal and a laparoscopic procedure. the laparoscopic procedure is much less invasive  which means there are fewer risks involved and the recovery time is shorter.a laparoscopic procedure means that instead of making a large incision and the surgeon using their hands to do the surgery inside your body  a very small set of incisions are made and instruments with long handles are inserted into the holes. the surgeon uses the instruments to do the surgery without ever opening up the abdomen. the laparoscopic procedure may not be an option for all patients  depending on their surgical histories and the anatomy of the individual s kidney and whether it can be accessed and removed with the laparoscopic instruments alone.    your doctor will give you specific instructions that you must follow prior to surgery. most commonly  you will be restricted from eating and drinking in the hours leading up to your surgery  usually beginning the night before. this is to prevent aspiration of food into your lungs when you are under anesthesia. it is very important to follow these and all other instructions  as they are meant to reduce your risk of surgical complications.make sure your doctor knows about all of the medications you are taking. you may be required to stop some medications prior to surgery.    depending on the type of surgery and a host of personal factors  recovery typically takes anywhere between one and six weeks. you should expect to experience pain  discomfort  and fatigue while you recover.it s a good idea to have a caretaker available to help you with daily activities  like preparing meals and you may have to spend a few days recovering in the hospital before you are sent home. people who are in good shape tend to recover from surgery faster than people who are out of shape  so you might want to begin an exercise regimen before your surgery.moving around in the days following your surgery will help you avoid complications  such as blood clots.  your doctor will probably have you come in for at least one post surgical check up. the purpose of this is to make sure you are healing properly  so be sure to go to all scheduled appointments.it is also important to continue getting regular medical checkups throughout your life. your doctor may want to monitor your kidney function to make sure your remaining kidney is functioning properly.    when you are released from the hospital  your doctor will give you a list of activities that you should avoid for certain periods of time. these restrictions are meant to help you heal and to protect you from injury  so it is very important that you follow them.you should not do any heavy lifting in the weeks following your surgery. your doctor will provide you with specific guidelines. depending on the type of work you do  you may not be medically cleared to return to work for several weeks. the more strenuous your

query	82	break pubis measure fundal height  though measuring your fundal height doesn t take long  it does typically require an office visit.   being at the doctor s office also gives you the added benefit of being able to immediately discuss the results of your fundal height test with your doctor  should anything out of the ordinary be found.    depending on how far along you are in your pregnancy  your doctor may ask you to empty your bladder.   the reason for this is that starting at around the 17 week mark  a full bladder can cause the fundal height measurement to off by a matter of centimeters.  fundal height measurements are fairly precise   a discrepancy of only a centimeter or two can make the difference between a  normal  measurement and an  abnormal one .   clothes  belts  and so on can cause small differences in your fundal height  so they are typically removed before measuring. changing into a hospital gown minimizes the possibility of an inaccurate result and additionally offers your doctor the ability to easily access all areas needed for a good fundal height measurement.    your doctor will ask you to lay in a semi recumbent position  this is simply laying on your back with your head slightly elevated . the semi recumbent position makes it easy for the doctor to feel for your uterus by palpating the skin near your belly button.    before the actual measurement takes place  your doctor or his nurse or midwife will palpate your pregnant uterus to determine the baby s size  the baby s positioning and the baby s presentation.   the doctor  nurse  and or midwife will also check the volume of amniotic fluid and also attempt to identify the uterine fundus   the point on your stomach where the  top  of the uterus can be felt.    after the palpation  the doctor will hold a metric based measurement tape at the top of the uterus  or fundus  and stretch it along the top of your pregnant uterus  measuring along the longitudinal axis.   this means that the doctor will measure from the highest point of your uterus to the top of your symphysis pubis  the area located below your belly button where your pubic bone begins . the doctor will record your fundal height measurement in centimeters and enter it on your chart. as a very general rule  a woman s fundal height should be within 1 to 3 centimeters of the baby s gestational age in weeks. for example  for a woman who s been pregnant for 20 weeks  a fundal height of about 17 23 cm is expected.  after giving you a chance to dress  your doctor will come back and talk to you. at this point  if your fundal height measurement was abnormal  you ll probably discuss the possibility of additional tests.    if your measurements do not fall within the normal parameters for your projected due date  this is not always a reason to worry. however  your doctor will probably want you to follow up with a sonogram in order to find out why your measurement was outside of the normal range of values.   this can be for a variety of reasons   some completely harmless  others that are cause for concern  but by no means catastrophic . below are many of the causes for an abnormal fundal height being especially tall and thin or short and heavy having a full bladder having twins  triplets  etc. abnormally slow or rapid fetal growth too little or too much amniotic fluid uterine fibroids having a child that has settled into breech or another unusual uterine position    it s not difficult at all to measure your fundal height on your own. to begin  empty your bladder and shed your clothing as you would in preparation for a fundal height measurement at the doctor s office. if you d like  you may choose to put on a loose gown or similar garment  like an over sized tee shirt  to simulate a hospital gown.   because most laypeople aren t medically trained in the procedure of measuring fundal heights and because  as noted above  an abnormal fundal height can have a wide variety of causes  it s important to remember not to make any medical decisions based on the results of a self performed fundal height test. if you obtain an abnormal result  follow up with a trained doctor  nurse  or midwife for confirmation.    soft  flexible sewing style measuring tools work best  as they can conform to the curve of your stomach for a more accurate measurement. however  in a pinch  a ruler or even your fingers can work as a measuring tool. typically  fundal heights are measured in centimeters  but if all you have are tools that measure in inches  use the conversion factor 1 inch   2.54 cm.    hard surfaces  like the floor  work best   soft surfaces  like some mattresses  can allow your posture to  sink  into the surface somewhat. if desired  feel free to place a pillow under your head.    the symphysis pubis  pubic bone  is a small  ridge like bone on the front of the body just above the pubic area. feel for the top of the pubic bone just below the bottom of your stomach   usually  this is near the top of where your pubic hair naturally extends. the pubic bone is often covered by a layer of subcutaneous fat which can make it somewhat tricky to find   you may need to press gently into your skin with your fingers to feel it.    next  find your fundus  the  top  of your uterus  by feeling near your belly button. relax your stomach muscles as you gently massage the area above and below your belly button. feel for a vague  ridge  beneath the skin   this is your fundus.   generally  before the 20th week of pregnancy  the fundus will be below the belly button  while after the 20th week  it will be above it.  when you ve found both your pubic bone and your fundus  it s time to measure. hold the  0  end of your tape measure against the top of your pubic bone and carefully stretch it across your pubis  up and over the curve of your stomach  and to your fundus. record this measurement  in cm . generally  fundal heights should be within 1 4 cm of the baby s gestational age in weeks. for example  a 20 week old pregnancy should have a fundal height of about 16 24 cm.   if you don t have measuring tape or a ruler handy  use the old  traditional method of using your fingers. the width of one finger in the fundal height is roughly equivalent to one week of gestation time. thus  for a 15 week old pregnancy  you should expect roughly 15 finger widths of fundal height.    as noted above  there are many  many reasons why a woman s fundal height may not be within the expected 1 4 cm range of the baby s gestational age in weeks. some of these reasons are harmless  while others are causes for mild concern. if you seem to be obtaining fundal height measurements that are outside of your expected range  contact a doctor for a definitive fundal height measurement and  if necessary  follow up tests.  
query	83	evaluate respiratory system test for botulism  difficulty coordinating movements  such as walking  is a common sign of botulism. muscle tone is lost when the body is affected by botulism.   usually  muscle tone loss spreads from your shoulders to your arms and down to the legs. the toxin acts on the nervous system impacting both voluntary and involuntary nervous system functions. it causes a descending paralysis  meaning it acts from head to toe  in that order. the paralysis is symmetric  meaning it affects both sides of the body the same  in contrast to the neurologic symptoms one may see in a stroke  which affect only one side of the body. muscle weakness is one of the first symptoms and can manifest as difficulties with speech  vision  and breathing. these symptoms are all caused by the toxin affecting the nerves and their receptors that control organs and muscles.    speech is affected because the neurotoxin produced by c. botulinum can affect the speech centers in your brain. when these cranial nerves are affected  it causes problems with speech and mouth movement.   the neurotoxin affects the cranial nerves 11 and 12  the nerves responsible for speech.    ptosis  drooping of eyelids  happens because of the neurotoxin affecting cranial nerve 3  which is responsible for the eye s movement  pupil size and eyelid motion. an affected person s pupils will be dilated and vision will be blurry  too.   eyelid drooping can occur in one eye or both eyes at the same time.    problems with breathing can occur due to the effect of botulism on your respiratory system. the botulism neurotoxin can cause reduced respiratory muscle activity and impaired gas exchange.   this damage can cause respiratory failure and breathing problems.    blurry and double vision can occur when botulism damages cranial nerve number 2. this nerve is responsible for your sense of sight  carrying images to the brain.    in infants progressive decreased muscle tone can present as a  floppy  infant that feels similar to a  rag doll.  symptoms can also present as decreased or poor feeding due to decreased muscular ability to nurse or take the bottle.other symptoms in infants include  a weak cry  dehydration  and decreased tear production. the immature immune system is unable to mount an immune response to this spore  which then germinates in the digestive tract and excretes its toxin.  botulism is a serious disease  and it is important that you see a doctor immediately if you suspect you may have contracted botulism.   these symptoms usually manifest 18 to 36 hours after exposure to botulinus. once symptoms are felt  immediate medical intervention is required.    after you have noticed botulism symptoms  immediately go to a hospital and have yourself checked by a doctor.    there may also be decreased or absent bowel sounds on examination of the abdomen  which may be distended.   an infant may present with generalized hypotonia  decreased muscle tone . in severe cases  the infected person may have respiratory failure or hypoxemia  low oxygen level . your doctor will also ask you if you had an open wound or have ingested contaminated food within 24   48 hours.    there are several diagnostic tests used to confirm botulism that can be ordered by your physician. your doctor may order one  or all  of them to confirm the infection.   lab  positive culture of vomit  saliva  nasogastric secretions  stool  or blood or suspicious food for the bacteria  c botulinum.electromyography  an electromyelogram will demonstrate neuromuscular findings and assist in confirming the diagnosis. the emg usually has two parts  a nerve conduction study  which uses electrodes taped to your skin to evaluate your motor neurons and a needle electrode exam  which uses a small needle inserted into your muscles to evaluate your muscles  electrical activity.radiography  abdominal radiographs will show a  paralytic ileus   or lack of normal gastric motility  which results in the distention of the small bowel. a spinal tap may also be needed to rule out other causes of a patient s symptoms.    if the patient has low oxygen levels for any reason  airway management is essential. a breathing tube and ventilation will be used in extreme cases.   in some cases it is necessary to insert a nasogastric tube to drain stomach contents and oral secretions. assisted feeding may also be required.    if patient is awake and  still importantly  has bowel sounds  the doctor may consider the cautious use of enemas or antiemetics to decrease the load of toxin. a bladder catheter may be inserted for drainage of urine  as toxins can cause urinary retention.   an antitoxin is available for children older than one year and adults  if the diagnosis of botulism is confirmed. antibiotics are only given for wound botulism.    the doctor or surgeon should decontaminate wound causes of botulism via irrigation and debridement. in addition  your doctor should prescribe antibiotics  high dose penicillin  and antitoxin.    throw away any canned products that appear dented or bulging. this is especially important with home canning products  such as preserves.  these products can harbor the botulism bacteria. this does not affect most adults but can infect infants  because of small children s weaker immune systems.there are about 115 cases of infant botulism each year. there is a caution about giving children under the age of one raw honey  however this was found to be the culprit in only 15  of cases. in 85  of cases  the causes were unknown but included possible contaminated formula  corn syrup  or some form of cross contamination from a caregiver who had contact with spores.  keep bandaged if outdoors.if you suspect wound botulism  see a medical professional immediately.   launder soiled clothing appropriately with hot water and detergent if worn by an agriculture worker or laborer. wound botulism can also infect people who use intravenous needles on a regular basis. use safer needle handling practices or avoid the use of intravenous needles altogether.

query	85	cause shock spot distributive shock symptoms  you can take someone s pulse  or listen to their heart with a stethoscope  to determine their heart rate.   in distributive shock  when you feel the pulse at the person s extremities  wrists and or ankles   you are likely to feel a  bounding pulse.  a bounding pulse is a stronger  more forceful pulse than normal. it is due to the increased total blood volume in distributive shock  from the vasodilatory effects that occur in sepsis or anaphylaxis  among other things . the bounding pulse may be felt early  but as the shock progresses  the pulse will become weak or absent in the extremities.    this is because the fundamental problem in shock is lack of oxygen delivery to the body s vital organs. therefore  the body tries to compensate for the lack of oxygen by breathing more rapidly.   greater than 20 breaths per minute is considered an elevated respiratory rate.    this is because distributive shock  perhaps counter intuitively  presents with more blood than normal in the circulatory system  however  the blood is  distributed  inappropriately throughout the body  leading to inadequate circulation to the vital organs and excess blood flow to the extremities and to areas of the body that do not need it.    as a result  urine output will decrease  leading to infrequent urination.    a temperature greater than 38 degrees celsius  100.4 degrees fahrenheit  may be indicative of an infection.   a temperature less than 36 degrees celsius  96.8 degrees fahrenheit  is also of concern  as sometimes the body can present with a reduced temperature rather than with a fever.    this is due to the decreased effectiveness of blood flow and oxygenation throughout the body. in more severe cases  the person may even be unconscious.    it is typically below 90 mm hg systolic  and it may even be undetectable. in distributive shock  even though more blood than normal is shunted to the extremities  the arms and legs   the blood vessels have dilated and  as such  the blood pressure reading still tends to be low.    therefore  if you are trying to recognize distributive shock  ask about and assess for any recent or current infections.   the most common infections that can lead to shock include pneumonias  genitourinary infections  and abdominal infections.    people often carry an  epipen   epinephrine pen  if they have been diagnosed with allergies that may lead to anaphylaxis and or distributive shock. inquire if there was exposure to a triggering allergen before the onset of shock.   nan  lactic acidosis is an indication that the body s vital organs are not getting enough blood flow and oxygen  which  if not resolved  could lead to multi organ failure.   the degree of lactic acidosis  therefore  is a way to measure the severity of shock symptoms.    white blood cells can also be elevated in other inflammatory conditions that may underlie distributive shock.   if an infection   septic shock   is suspected as the cause of distributive shock  blood cultures can also be taken. a blood culture can grow the bacteria or other microbe that is causing the infection  allowing doctors to choose an appropriate antibiotic  or other antimicrobial agent  depending upon the cause of the infection  for treatment.    because the consequence of shock that is trying to be avoided is vital organ failure  it is key to assess the function of vital organs. organs to test include    kidney function liver function heart function pancreas function  as pancreatitis can actually be a cause of distributive shock    if distributive shock  or any other form of shock  is suspected or diagnosed clinically  it is key to identify the underlying cause so that it can be resolved. additional diagnostic tests that may be of use include a chest x ray and or a ct scan  among other things.   further tests will be ordered depending on the suspected etiology  for example  if pneumonia is suspected  a sputum culture and gram stain may be ordered as well.  if shock is confirmed  the patient must be treated in the intensive care unit  icu  of a hospital. the underlying cause must be treated as the patient is stabilized with oxygen. vital signs and fluid intake and outtake should be measure hourly.
query	86	care skin choose a skin care line  knowing your skin type is essential to finding the right products to care for it. the basic types are normal  oily  dry  and combination. your type is determined by the size of your pores  the degree of oil and moisture in your skin  and its sensitivity to environmental irritants.you have normal skin if you have few imperfections  no significant sensitivities  and small pores that are barely visible. oily skin generally comes from large pores. it leads to dull or shiny skin that is prone to blackheads  acne  and other blemishes that arise from clogged pores. you have dry skin if your skin is rough  scaly  or dull. it also may be spotted with red or itchy patches. your pores will be so small as to be practically invisible. combination skin that combines areas of oily  normal  and or dry skin is common. for instance  many people have larger pores that produce more oil on their foreheads  noses  and chins.    besides knowing your skin type  you should also note if you have any significant sensitivities to environmental irritants. if your skin sometimes itches  stings  burns  and or breaks out in a rash when you use beauty or hygienic products  then you have sensitive skin.if you do  you should go for beauty products that are for sensitive skin  hypoallergenic  and free from dyes and fragrances.    besides catering to a particular skin type  many skin care lines are aimed at improving specific  treatable conditions that affect your skin. ask yourself what problems you are trying to correct or prevent so that you can pick products to address them.for instance  do you want to get rid of acne  acne scars  rosacea  dark spots or pigmentation  are there wrinkles or other signs of aging that you d like to address  would you like to minimize large pores or treat blackheads  is the skin under your eyes puffy or discolored     is your skin fair  light  medium  or dark  while this won t make a difference for many products  it s useful to keep in mind when you re buying products that are tinted to match your skin  such as tinted moisturizers . it s also helpful to think about when considering the degree of sun protection that you d like your skin care products to provide.if you have fair skin  it s likely that you burn easily and should go for a skin care line that offers a high spf of 30 . if you re light or medium in complexion  pick products that offer some protection in the 15 30 spf range. if you have darker skin and only rarely burn  you can choose a line with minimal to no sun protection.    make sure that you keep notes about your skin assessments for your reference. many skin care products are made to address specific skin care needs and issues. you want to have your skin type  condition  and tone on hand as you select beauty products to help you make the best choices.   for example  your skin may be dry but also sensitive  so you need products designed for both dry and sensitive skin  as opposed to something heavy that may be hydrating but also irritating. perhaps your skin is combination and patchy in its coloring. you may want products that balance the skin s moisture and tone.    besides knowing your skin needs  it s important to know your budget when it comes to skin care. prices for skin care products can vary greatly  ranging anywhere from a few dollars to a few hundred or more. figuring out your minimum and maximum expenditure is very useful for limiting your skin care options.for example  facial moisturizers alone can run you anywhere from less than  10  like purpose dual treatment moisture lotion  to around  50  like lancome bienfait multi vital sunscreen cream  to more than  100  such as tracie martyn re sculpting cream .as a general rule  product lines carried at salons  boutiques  high end department stores  and spas tend to cost more than those on the shelves of your local pharmacy or discount retailer.    organic products must use all natural materials that have not been genetically modified  synthetically produced  or grown with pesticides or chemical fertilizers. while there is no evidence that they are more effective than other types of skin care products  some people prefer organic lines because of their lack of potentially toxic chemical ingredients and ethical  environmentally sound production standards.the use of the word  organic  on product labels is highly regulated by the usda  so you can be confident that the product that advertises itself as such meets a strict code. however  words like  natural    non toxic   or  hypoallergenic  are not regulated. since they have no set legal definition  it s important to treat them as marketing terms rather than specific factual claims.    when you re looking for a skin care line  you should pick those products that have active ingredients that have been clinically proven to be effective. be sure to check the labels to ensure that the lines you are considering have at least 5 15  concentrations of safe and effective active ingredients.the most important active ingredients are vitamins a  b  c  and e  but they will most likely take on different names on product labels. for vitamin a  which helps with moisturizing  acne  rosacea  and dermatitis  look for retinoic acid  retinol  or retinyl propionate. for vitamins b   b5  which moisturize while addressing acne  itchiness  eczema  and sunburn  look for niacin  nicotinamide  pantothenic acid  or panthenol. for vitamin c  which enhances skin texture while decreasing wrinkles and sun damage  look for l ascorbic acid. for vitamin e  which moisturizes and helps prevent wrinkles  look for di alpha tocopherol. do not use products that include tocopherol acetate  since this form of vitamin e is especially susceptible to degradation from sunlight and can therefore actually cause damage to your skin.    the most basic  line  will pair a cleanser with a moisturizer. if you re looking for a more complete regime that can address more specific issues  you can consider adding on toners  exfoliators  serums  and or specific treatments  for instance  for nights  wrinkles  under eye puffing and discoloration  or acne .the amount of product you get should correspond with both your skin care needs and lifestyle. more comprehensive lines will be more costly to purchase and time consuming to administer.    now that you ve done your homework  it s time to start finding the right products to match your needs and preferences. the best way to do so is to take all of your requirements with you to a pharmacy  beauty shop  department store  salons  or skin care center where you can consult with an esthetician. tell them your needs and preferences  and ask for their advice about which skin care lines would offer the best fit for you.for instance  when you approach an esthetician for advice  you could say something like   hi  i m looking for an inexpensive line of skin care products. i ve got dry  sensitive skin that s very fair. i m looking for products that can address wrinkles and other signs of aging while providing sun protection. do you have any recommendations and samples i could try   or   hello  can you help me  i ve got dark  combination skin that s prone to acne. could you suggest some appropriate skin care products that are under  100   avoid salespeople who represent a particular line. you want advice from someone who is unbiased and knowledgeable about multiple brands. ask for multiple options with a range of price points that fit in your budget. keep your budget in mind when picking where to go for recommendations. over the counter lines at pharmacies and beauty shops will be less expensive than those offered exclusively by salons or skin care centers. however  the latter will be more likely to have qualified experts to guide you. many skin care centers will offer free consultations if you make an appointment in advance.    one of the nice things about consulting with an esthetician in person is that they will likely be able to give you samples of the skin care options that they recommend to you. while you won t be able to judge the long term effects of particular products  there s nothing like being able to test first hand if you like the general look and feel of a product as well as if the skin care routine associated with the line works for you.if you re sampling more than one line  keep notes about your impressions of each as you test them. list any pros and or cons about how the products make your skin look and feel to help you make your final decision. for example  when you re evaluating a cleanser  you may write something like   pros  nice fragrance  good lather  rinses off cleanly. cons  dries out skin.  if you re taking notes on a moisturizer  you might write   pros  pleasant feel and texture  all day hydration  sun protection. cons  makes skin shiny around t zone.     samples will give you a preliminary first hand impression  but if you want to hear more about customers  long term satisfaction with the line  seek out reviews.most online stores that sell multiple skin care lines  such as amazon or sephora  will enable customer reviews to lend credibility to the products on offer. search for a particular product to see how it rates  and read the written reviews to see the volume of reviewers and hear why they gave the ratings they did. there are also some product reviews available from skin care experts. do an online search for your product s name    review  to see if it has been evaluated by an unbiased expert. only consider those reviews that include the author s skin care credentials and indicate that they have no financial ties to the brand being reviewed.    see if the product packaging lists any potential side effects that you should be aware of. besides looking at customer reviews  research the safety of your line through databases that conduct independent testing of skin care products.some skin care products may alleviate a specific problem quickly but may not be best for long term use. see if this is the case for your line before you commit to it. try consumerlab.com  an independent review site that tests health and nutritional products  for reports on your skin care line. search for a particular product and or active ingredient in it to ensure that your line is safe for consumer use.    once you ve found a skin care line that checks out in terms of the samples and reviews  go ahead a purchase its core products. be sure that you re satisfied with the basic components of a line before investing in the whole shebang. if the cleanser  toner  and moisturizer are working well for your skin  start adding on the extras to address your specific needs  such as exfoliants  masks  serums  and treatments.

the proper standing and sitting posture means that you draw your voice not directly from the larynx  but from the diaphragm. you also relieve pressure on your larynx by relaxing your shoulders  which means that you would talk in your natural pitch. if you keep your feet flat and steady  you also give yourself a very stable vertical base to support your body when you talk.  sometimes  impediments in speech  like stuttering  grow from nerves and anxiety.before you have to speak in front of a group  go through a deep breathing activity to calm your nerves  relax your body  and get you in the right mental state for proper speech.   sit comfortably and with an erect posture. breathe in deeply through your nose. you should use your hand to feel your stomach expanding like a balloon being inflated. hold the breath and then release it slowly  feeling your stomach deflating beneath your hand. repeat this exercise before you have to speak publicly to relieve stress.    another great advantage to proper posture is that you look and feel good whenever you re speaking  whether it s a formal speaking engagement or a chat over lunch. proper posture boosts your confidence  and tells people that you know what you re talking about.    this professional will diagnose your specific speech disorder and discover the causes. then  they will decide which interventions will be most helpful in enabling you to speak correctly. the therapist will determine how much speech therapy you need  and you should regularly attend therapy for the best results. therapists are capable of improving speech impediments in both children and adults.speech therapy is helpful for correcting your impediment. the therapist will point out the part of speech where you re having problems  and will work with you to correct it. private speech therapy sessions do not come cheap  although most insurance policies will fund services needed to treat speech disorders. there s no substitute for learning and practice when it comes to the proper and effective use of language. take every opportunity to speak  to practice and brush up on the correct pronunciation and enunciation provided to you by a professional.    these practitioners can help you overcome your speech impediments if they are caused by emotional distress or learning disabilities. counseling provided by the professional is very useful if you need to break out of your silence and to talk about your problems  your frustrations  or your own personal tragedy. such interventions might help you come to terms with anxiety and learn effective ways of coping that still enable you to speak properly.  if you have misaligned teeth  you may have difficulty pronouncing some words because of a lisp. most malocclusions are corrected through braces. braces pull  push  and adjust individual teeth to correct your bite. the problem with braces is that they often cause a speech impediment  especially when the springs  bands and wires of a set of braces are adjusted every month.every time the dentist adjusts your braces  or even dentures   you need to train yourself to talk and to eat properly. it may be quite painful at first  but remember not to go too far  lest you end up with a mouth injury. most braces are used for orthodontic purposes  although some braces can be used as decorations. braces are rather expensive  and you may need to take out a dental plan or cash in on dental insurance to pay for them. kids and teenagers don t like to wear braces because they re often teased as  metal mouths  or  railroad faces.  the fact is that braces are still the best way to correct a lisp caused by misaligned teeth.    features that present at birth or due to physical injuries may result in medical conditions that limit your ability to speak. many of these physical conditions can be rectified with proper speech and medical treatment.   cleft lips and palates were a major cause of speech impediments until surgery became affordable. now  children born with clefts can have reconstructive surgery and a multidisciplinary team of providers that help with feeding and speech and language development.malocclusion is when the teeth do not have the proper normal bite. malocclusions are usually corrected through braces  although orthodontic surgery is necessary in some cases. individuals with this condition may talk with a lisp  make a whistle sound when certain words are spoken  or mumble.neurological disorders caused by accidents or brain and nerve tumors can cause a speech disorder called dysprosody. dysprosody involves difficulty in expressing the tonal and emotional qualities of speech such as inflection and emphasis.  dyslexia and other learning disabilities can prevent a person from learning how to speak properly. children who suffer from learning disabilities often have speech impediments  although they can be overcome through speech therapy.  people who suffer from traumatic experiences often develop speech problems like stammering and stuttering. a death in the family  a horrible accident  or a crime can often affect the ability of a person to speak clearly.  some speech impediments are permanent  especially when caused by neurological disorders. on the other hand  a speech impediment may be the result of not having been taught how to speak clearly and communicate effectively. if you or your child are not taught proper speech practices at school or at home as a youth  it could lead to a speech impediment. these conditions  however  can generally be overcome.    on the other hand  many people with speech impediments encounter these problems because it runs in their families. in fact  research shows that inherited speech and language impairments are more likely to occur the more individuals in the family are affected. in other words  if both parents and one sibling have a speech disorder  the other sibling has a higher chance of having one as well.
query	88	reduce spinal muscular atrophy build up atrophied muscles  muscle atrophy is the medical term used to denote the condition when a part of the body suffers muscle loss or when muscle tissue wastes away.it s normal for muscle atrophy to occur as we age  but it can also be a sign of a more serious medical condition  illness  or injury. muscle atrophy can negatively impact a person s quality of life because they lose strength and mobility  which can make it difficult to perform basic tasks. people with atrophied muscles are also at an increased risk for falling or injuring themselves. since the heart is also a muscle that can break down  individuals experiencing muscle atrophy face the risk of heart problems.    muscles can atrophy from disuse  or when they are not used regularly at an appreciable level of exertion. this disuse causes the muscle tissue to break down  shorten in length  and waste away. this typically occurs as a result of an injury  sedentary lifestyle  or medical condition that prevents a person from exercising his muscles.disuse muscle atrophy can also result from severe malnourishment. for example  prisoners of war and people suffering from eating disorders such as anorexia may experience muscle loss and the wasting away of muscle tissue. people with jobs that require them to be seated for major portions of each work day or people who are not physically active can also experience this type of muscle atrophy. severe injuries such as those to the spinal cord or brain may leave someone bedridden and result in atrophied muscles. even common injuries such as broken bones or sprains that restrict your ability to move around can also cause disuse muscle atrophy. medical conditions that limit a person s ability to exercise or be physically active include rheumatoid arthritis  which causes joint inflammation  and osteoarthritis  which weakens the bones. these conditions can make it uncomfortable  painful  or even impossible to exercise  leading to atrophied muscles. in many cases of disuse muscle atrophy  the loss of muscle tissue can be reversed by increasing physical exercise.    neurogenic muscle atrophy is caused by a disease or injury to the nerves attached to the muscles. it is less common than disuse muscle atrophy  but harder to treat because nerve regeneration usually requires more than increased exercise. some of the diseases that often lead to neurogenic atrophy include     polio  a viral disease that can cause paralysis. muscular dystrophy  a hereditary disease that weakens the muscles.  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  which is also known as als or lou gehrig s disease  attacks the nerve cells that communicate with and control muscles.guillain barre syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that causes your body s immune system to attack your nerves  resulting in muscle paralysis and weakness.multiple sclerosis  or ms  is another autoimmune disease that can immobilize the whole body.  it s important to recognize the symptoms of muscle atrophy early so you can begin treating your condition. some of the main symptoms include muscle weakness and decrease in muscle size. skin around the affected muscle may seem to sag away from the muscle. difficulty lifting things  moving the atrophied area  or doing exercise that was once easy. pain in the affected area. back pain and difficulty walking. a feeling of stiffness or heaviness in the affected area. the symptoms of neurogenic muscle atrophy can be harder for someone without a medical background to recognize  but some of the more visible symptoms include a stooped posture  a rigid spine  and a limited ability to move the neck.    if you suspect that you are experiencing muscle atrophy  it s a good idea to talk with your doctor or a medical professional as soon as possible. they will be able to properly diagnose your condition and provide treatment for the underlying causes.if the reason for muscle deterioration is an illness  your doctor may be able to prescribe medications that will help you maintain your muscle mass or reverse some damage of muscle atrophy. anti inflammatory medicines such as corticosteroids are sometimes given to patients with muscle atrophy  which helps to reduce inflammation and compression of the affected muscle nerves. this can make exercise and daily activities more comfortable. to diagnose muscle atrophy  doctors often use blood tests  x rays  ct scans  emg scans  mri scans  and muscle or nerve biopsies. they may also measure muscle tone and reflexes.a doctor will also be able to talk with you about whether any kinds of exercise can stop the loss of muscle tissues or if you need to undergo surgeries and other kinds of treatments.    depending on what is causing the muscle atrophy  your doctor might recommend you work with a physical therapist  nutritionist  or a personal trainer who can improve your condition with targeted exercise  diet  and lifestyle changes.    even if the doctor did not find that your muscle atrophy is caused by a specific disease  it s a good idea to talk with your doctor or health provider before attempting to build up atrophied muscles. you don t want to overdo anything or endanger your health  and your doctor may be able to refer you to a qualified trainer or physical therapist.  though you can do some physical activities on your own to reverse muscle atrophy s effects  it is always best to have a qualified instructor or trainer to ensure that you are on the right track.   she will start out by assessing your capabilities and guide you through specific exercises to build muscle in the atrophied areas. she can also gauge your progress and adjust the exercise routine as needed.    since many people with atrophied muscles are beginning exercise again after a long break from physical activity  it s important to start slowly. remember  your body is not as strong as it was prior to atrophy.    swimming and water exercises are often recommended for patients who are trying to recover from muscle atrophy because this form of exercise can dull muscle pain  quickly tone atrophied muscles  rebuild muscle memory  and relax sore muscles. while it s best to work with an expert  here are a few basic steps to get you started   with water at hip  to waist height  try walking around the pool for 10 minutes. this workout is low risk and helps develop the muscles in the lower part of your body.   as you progress  increase the time interval and the depth of the water. you can also use paddles or water barbells for more resistance. these tools will help work your core and upper body.    try a knee lift by positioning your back against the pool wall  and placing both feet flat on the bottom of the pool. then  lift a knee up as if you are marching in place. when your knee is at hip height  extend it outward.   keep doing this for ten repetitions  before switching to the other leg. as you progress  try doing additional sets for each leg.    face the pool wall with your arms resting on the deck of the pool and shoulder width apart. use your hands to raise your body up out of the water so you are about halfway out of the pool. hold the position for a few seconds and then slowly lower yourself back in the pool.   for an easier version  place your hands on the pool deck so they are shoulder width apart. as you bend your elbows  lean your chest toward the wall of the pool.    if you feel proficient doing exercises in the water  add some body weight exercises while on dry land.   a beginner can start with eight to twelve repetitions of the exercise moves mentioned below. these exercises target the major muscle groups. perform this routine three times per week to build up atrophied muscles.    to perform a squat  stand straight and put both hands forward. slowly and carefully bend your knees  as if sitting in an imaginary chair. hold this position for a few seconds before going back to the starting position.keep your weight on your heels and do not allow your knees to go past your toes.    to perform lunges  stand up straight with your hands on your hips. pull your abdominal muscles in.take a large step forward with your right foot. keep your back straight while moving forward. your heel should be raised while the tip of the toe is pressing against the floor. bend both knees at the same time until they both form a 90 degree angle. you can check your position at the mirror to know if you are doing it right. put your heel down and push upwards to stand. return to the starting position and do all of the above with the left leg. remember that your body should not be slouching forward.    to do a triceps dip  prepare a strong bench or a secured chair. sit on the bench or chair and place your hands shoulder width apart along the edge.slowly slide your butt off the seat with your legs extended in front of you. straighten your arms to keep tension on the triceps. bend your elbows carefully while keeping your back close to the bench. upon completing this part  press down on the bench to straighten your arms.    for a basic ab crunch  lie on your back on a mat or a carpeted surface. bend your knees and make sure that your feet are flat on the floor.you can cross your arms in front of your chest or place your hands behind your neck or head. try to pull your shoulders towards the ceiling by making use of the force from your abdominal muscles. hold the  crunched  position for a few seconds  then lie back down and repeat.    make use of resistance tools such as resistance bands or weight machines to help you with your form. you should only move on to these exercises once you can successfully perform the body weight exercises indicated above. it s also a good idea to research specific resistance exercises that target the affected area.bench presses can be done with resistance bands. lay down on a bench and push forward while gripping the bands like you are lifting barbells. start with lighter weight bands. if you feel comfortable with the current weight  fold it lengthwise to increase the resistance. once you feel comfortable  you can move on to heavier weight bands.    in addition to the other exercises described in this article  cardio exercise is a good way to build up atrophied muscles. try establishing a regular walking or cardio routine.start with ten to fifteen minutes of continuous walking per day. gradually increase your speed and try to take a 30 minute walk or jog daily.    after each workout  stretch your muscles to increase their range of motion. do five to ten minutes of stretching after each workout. you can also perform a separate stretching session.make sure to perform stretches that target all of the major muscles  and hold each stretch for 15 to 30 seconds. begin with stretching your back and your upper body. next move on to stretches for your neck  forearms  wrists and triceps. do not forget your chest  buttocks and groin area before moving to your thighs. lastly  perform stretches for instep and hamstrings.    here are some specific stretching exercises for different parts of the body neck stretching  incline your head forward then stretch your neck to the left  right  back and forward. do not roll your head from side to side as this practice is dangerous. shoulder stretching  place your left arm on your chest. grab the forearm with the opposite arm. pull it until you feel that your shoulder is being stretched. push the arm you are stretching in the opposite direction to contract the muscles. do the same steps for the right arm. triceps stretching  start with raising your right arm. bend the right elbow and reach down behind your head and between the shoulder blades. make use of the left arm to reach and grab the right elbow. lastly  pull your elbow toward your head. wrist stretching  simply hold your arm out and slightly pull back your hand with the opposite hand. do this repetitively. hamstrings stretching  start in a cross legged sitting position. put one leg out. attempt to reach and hold the foot for a few seconds. go back to the starting position and do the same thing with the other leg. lower back stretch  lie down on your back. bring one leg up to chest level. do the same with the other leg. leg stretching  lie down on your back and extend both legs in the air. grab the back of your thighs and pull the legs toward your face.    a constant supply of protein is necessary for muscle growth. see the basic guidelines below for daily recommended protein intake based on your age and gender.adult men should eat about 56 grams of protein per day. adult women should eat about 46 grams per day. women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should eat at least 71 grams of protein per day. teenaged boys should eat about 52 grams a day. teenaged girls should eat about 46 grams per day. foods rich in protein include turkey breast  fish  cheese  pork loin  tofu  lean beef  beans  eggs  yogurt  dairy products  and nuts. a nutritionist  personal trainer  or dietician might suggest something other than the recommended dose based on your condition  weight  and activity level.    if you don t eat sufficient carbohydrates to fuel your body  it will start breaking down muscles instead. this can further aggravate the muscle atrophy in the affected area.to build atrophied muscle  your carbohydrate intake should be at least 45 to 65 percent of your total calorie intake.try to select carbohydrates that are also full of fiber and do not have a lot of added sugars. these include fruits and vegetables  whole grains  plain yogurt  and milk.    these good fats stop the breakdown of muscle by interfering with the inflammatory process.foods rich in omega 3 fatty acids include sardines  salmon  soybeans  flax seeds  walnuts  tofu  brussels sprouts  cauliflower  shrimp  and winter squash. the recommended dose for omega 3 fatty acids is 1 to 2 grams daily  when the body experiences stress  it prepares to respond. this preparation is known as the fight or flight response. in this response  many hormone levels shoot up including the stress hormone known as cortisol  which can break down muscle tissue during periods of prolonged stress.since stress cannot be completely eliminated in our lives  take steps to minimize. identifying the source of your stress can help you prevent it from occurring. you can also try stress control techniques such as meditation or yoga. for specific suggestions  talk with a therapist  counselor  or mental health professional about the stressors in your life.    when we sleep  our body builds and repairs muscles  so this is an important step to combat muscle atrophy.try to get seven to nine hours of sleep per day.

female to male transitions  or is not comfortable with prescribing testosterone to you  you may need to find another primary care physician or specialist who does have experience with hormone replacement therapy.    you ll also have your blood tested directly for testosterone levels.   if you have any conditions that could be worsened by taking testosterone  like blood clots or hormone sensitive cancers   you may need additional tests. your doctor might recommend an alternative treatment. you might also simply need to exercise more or change your diet to correct symptoms like increased fat  decreased bone mass  and feelings of fatigue. your doctor might direct you to see an endocrinologist  a doctor who specializes in hormones. it is illegal to buy  sell  or use testosterone without a prescription from a healthcare professional.    be sure to get at least two or three tests to establish your baseline testosterone level before deciding supplements are a good choice.   these tests will probably be performed in the morning  since that is when testosterone levels tend to be lowest. a healthy testosterone range for men ranges from 250   1 100 nanograms per deciliter of blood. taking additional testosterone will not speed up puberty. testosterone treatments are not appropriate for age related declines in testosterone levels.    this might take the form of heart palpitations or arrhythmia  a fluttering or racing heart  or heart valve problems that could produce lightheadedness  chest pain  or general feelings of fatigue. truly dangerous side effects include heart attacks  strokes  and heart failure.these side effects increase in likelihood with age.    common side effects of testosterone supplements include a high red blood cell count  breast

doctor will write you a prescription for appropriate tools  needles  pellets  or syringes .   injections come either as pellets that are inserted beneath the skin  or as a liquid shot. you may need to buy a special container to dispose of your used needles. you may choose to switch from injections to another  slower release method after you have been on testosterone for a few months and have begun to see significant changes. if you chose to use injections  your doctor will likely schedule you for a follow up appointment. you will need to bring your vial of testosterone  needles  and syringes to the appointment. they will teach you or a caregiver how to do the injections. you might also choose to return to the doctor s office to have them do your injections for you  often for the cost of your insurance plan s co payment.    simply place the small dispenser bottle into your nostril and squeeze the pump. repeat on the opposite nostril. squeeze your nostrils together gently and massage them

implants  the delivery methods for testosterone can be taken at home. after you receive your prescription from the pharmacy  follow the instructions on the packaging to administer the first dose. do not take more than the prescribed dose.   patches  injections  and nasal gels are not recommended for correcting age related testosterone level decline.over medicating can cause serious side effects  and it can decrease the effectiveness of the drug because your body converts excess testosterone into estrogen.  
query	90	produce thyroid hormone keep a healthy thyroid  eating fresh vegetables and fruits will help you maintain thyroid and overall health. you should also eat vegetables and fruits high in antioxidants  such bell pepper  cherries  tomatoes  blueberries  and squash. however  when you are working toward thyroid health  you need to know which kind of thyroid issue you suffer from because some vegetables can be more harmful than helpful.   for example  if you suffer from hypothyroidism  you should avoid anything in the cabbage family  such as kale  spinach  brussels sprouts  broccoli  and cabbage. these foods interfere with thyroid function.if you are taking certain medications for thyroid health  you should also avoid soy beans until you talk to your doctor.    processed and refined foods are not good for thyroid health. white breads  pastas  sugar  cookies  cakes  fast foods  and prepackaged foods are all processed and bad for your thyroid health. instead  make meals with fresh ingredients and use as little premade or processed components as possible.   try switching out certain prepackaged things for fresh ingredients. for example  don t eat instant oatmeal in the morning. instead  use steel cut oatmeal and add nuts and spices to it. avoid canned vegetables and make them fresh. these small steps will help you cut down on processed foods and help your thyroid health.  caffeine and alcohol can impact the health of your thyroid. if you have hyperthyroidism  you should ask your doctor before using caffeinated beverages like soft drinks  coffee and tea. however  you should always ask your doctor before you increase your caffeine intake  no matter what kind of thyroid condition you have.  since you need iodine to combat thyroid problems  you need to make sure you get enough of it in your diet. iodine is eaten in dietary forms of iodine by eating foods grown in soil with the appropriate iodine content  such as mushrooms  onions  and garlic. you can also get iodine naturally by eating meat from organic grass fed animals. some animal feed adds in potassium iodate  which also adds iodine to the meat you eat. table salt is also a source of iodine because it has been supplemented with it.   you may suffer from a lack of iodine  or iodine deficiency  when you don t eat enough table salt because this is the primary source of iodine you get on a daily basis. this can occur in diets comprised of foods that are not cooked at home.  the amount of selenium you get through supplementation has an impact on your thyroid health. the link between selenium deficiency was only recently established in the 1990 s in relation to graves disease  an autoimmune thyroid disease. selenium supplementation provided a quicker return to healthy thyroid states than other methods.incorporate more foods that contain high selenium levels  such as brazil nuts  tuna  shrimp  oysters  liver chicken  and turkey.  taking vitamin a as supplements has been found to regulate thyroid metabolism and was associated with decreased thyroid hormone levels in obese and non obese patients studied. a dosage of 25 000 iu a day is recommended to maintain healthy thyroid function.you can also incorporate more vitamin a into your diet with foods such as sweet potatoes  carrots  and squash.  intense aerobic activity has been shown to help with higher levels of circulating thyroid hormones. aerobic exercise is any exercise which increases your target heart rate for a period of 30 minutes. incorporate more exercises  such as jogging  running  dancing  cycling and aerobics. you should work out for 30 minutes a day at least five times a week. your target heart rate is calculated by subtracting your age from 220 and multiplying by 0.7.   for example  if you are 35 years old  your target heart rate is 220 35   185  then 185x0.7   129.5.  if you suspect that you have a thyroid problem  then the first thing you should do is see your primary care physician for a physical exam and tests. your doctor can easily determine if you have a thyroid problem by interviewing you  performing a physical exam  and ordering some simple blood tests.  depending on your symptoms  lab tests may include a thyroid stimulating hormone concentration  tsh test   total thyroxine  t4 test   total triiodothyronine  t3 test   an or a free t4 concentration test. depending on the results of your bloodwork  you may also have to have imaging  such as an ultrasound or ct scan.  there are two common problems that can affect the thyroid. the thyroid can be overactive and overproduce the thyroid hormone  which is called hyperthyroidism. the thyroid can also be underactive and produce insufficient amounts of the thyroid hormone  which is called hypothyroidism. hypothyroidism is second only to diabetes as the most common endocrine disorder.   both conditions can cause a goiter  which is the enlargement of the thyroid in an effort to increase and manufacture thyroid hormone. a goiter presents as a glandular swelling that can be detected as a swelling in the neck. it is only considered a symptom  not a medical disorder in and of itself.  hyperthyroidism causes an increase in metabolic activity. symptoms of hyperthyroidism include    heat intolerance tachycardia or rapid heart rate weight loss sweating goiters  the most common causes of hyperthyroidism are grave s disease  a toxic thyroid adenoma  a toxic multinodular goiter  lymphocytic thyroiditis  heart medications such as amiodarone  or a primary pituitary disorder.   a thyroid storm is a rare cause and at the extreme end of the spectrum of hyperthyroidism. in this condition  the patient exhibits symptoms such as increased heart rate  vomiting  fever  diarrhea  dehydration  and altered mental status.  every cell in the body requires thyroid hormones and without them  signs of decreased metabolism are present. the symptoms of hypothyroidism are    weight gain depression dry skin memory impairment poor concentration constipation hair thinning or loss joint pains goiters cold intolerance  hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by an autoimmune destruction of the gland or by hashimoto s disease  which is a condition where the immune system attacks the thyroid gland. hypothyroidism may also be caused by primary glandular insufficiency for unknown reasons  iodine deficiency  pregnancy  congenital disorders  or issues with the pituitary gland.hypothyroidism can also result from lithium or iodine containing drugs. talk to your doctor about getting regular tests to monitor your thyroid if you take any of these types of drugs.    most often  hypothyroidism is diagnosed by simple blood tests  such as the tsh test and thyroid hormone test. generally  once you go to the doctor with the common symptoms of hypothyroidism  your doctor will run blood tests to check your hormone levels.   you may want to ask for a test if you are at higher risk of hypothyroidism. doctors may also suggest it themselves if you are an older woman or if you are pregnant or want to become pregnant.  in hypothyroidism  the body has a number of compensatory mechanisms which keep it functioning despite decreased hormone levels. in the event of sickness  such as infection  the body can increase its metabolic rate and the levels may overwhelm the body  causing coma. a severely low thyroid can even result in a myxedema coma  which is an extreme manifestation of hypothyroidism.  since the only concern with hypothyroidism is hormone productions  the only medication used for hypothyroidism is synthetic hormones. when the thyroid gland is not producing enough of any hormone  it must be supplemented. this can be supplemented with a synthetic thyroid hormone such as synthroid  in doses ranging from 50 micrograms to 300 micrograms. your doctor will use blood tests to determine your specific dose. your doctor will start you on a lower dose. between 50 to 100 micrograms daily and recheck the blood tests four to six weeks after starting the medication  looking for changes in your hormone levels.   your doctor will also take into account your clinical symptoms  such as weight gain  energy level  fatigue  concentration  depression  or other symptoms of decreased metabolism. if your levels are not to the point of hypothyroidism yet  your doctor may still prescribe a low dose of synthetic hormone to help level out the symptoms.in addition to synthetic hormones  your doctor may prescribe armour thyroid  which is actual bovine desiccated thyroid gland to help regulate yours. starting dose is commonly 60 mg daily  and continued until blood tests indicate a response.  radioactive iodine is used to destroy any active nodules in your thyroid in order to stop their uncontrolled production of the thyroid hormone. radioactive iodine therapy involves injection of radionuclide tagged iodine into a vein. the iodine is taken up by the thyroid gland  which absorbs the radioactive iodine. the radiation destroys the cells that comprise these active nodules that are producing excessive thyroid hormone  which causes the gland to shrink and symptoms to disappear within three to six months.   a single dose of this medication is successful in 80  of cases. pregnant women should not have this procedure.    your doctor may prescribe you anti thyroid medications such as methimazole when radioactive iodine is not permitted  such as with pregnant women or children. these medications prevent your thyroid from producing excess levels of the thyroid hormone and start helping symptoms in six to 12 weeks. methimazole is prescribed at 15 to 30 mg per daily.   treatment of a thyroid storm is treated with beta blockers  as well as hydration and sedatives. beta blockers are also prescribed if you have increased heart rate as a result of your hyperthyroidism.  your doctor may suggest surgery with thyroidectomy as the treatment of choice if you did not respond to medication or cannot take the medication  if you are pregnant  or are a child. this procedure is also done in cases for those with large goiters that are unsightly or compressing the trachea.   this surgery consists of the removal of the gland. if you have this surgery  you will have to have lifelong treatment to replace your thyroid hormone since you no longer have a gland to produce it.another option is a subtotal thyroidectomy. a surgeon will remove up to 90 percent of your thyroid gland under general anaesthetic. the remaining tissue may still produce enough thyroid hormone to mean replacement treatments are never required or not required for many years. you should monitor your general health for signs of change to your hormone health if you have a subtotal thyroidectomy.  
query	91	stop trichinosis grill pork tenderloin  tenderloin is a very lean meat  making it easy to dry out and make tough  regardless of how you cook it  especially if you re worried about cooking it well done because you re concerned about freshness. it s perfectly fine to cook pork to medium if you ve purchased fresh meat from a reputable source  and it ll be much more delicious to buy it and cook it right away  when the meat is at its peak freshness.   discard pork with any grayness or discoloration  and with any strange odor. fresh pork should be bright pink and should have no noticeable odor. trichinosis  a parasite once common in undercooked and raw pork products  has been virtually eradicated in commercially available pork. in the us  there are roughly 11 cases of trichinosis reported each year  most of which are contracted from wild game  not pork you bought at the store. while it s not necessary to char the heck out of pork for fear of this stomach bug  pork is as susceptible to spoilage as any meat.    tenderloin should be mostly pink and clean  with few bits of connective tissue or fat attached. if you get a piece that does have some  trim it off and discard it.   do not rinse raw meat in the sink  which can spread bacteria around your clean kitchen. simply pat it dry with a paper towel  if there are any undesirable bits stuck to it.    because tenderloin is such a lean meat  it s particularly amenable to marinades  rubs  and different seasoning combinations. rub the meat with the marinade of your choice. this might include your own blend of spices or a ready made marinade from the store. store the meat in a covered bowl or in a zip lock bag  then refrigerate overnight  or for at least 4 hours before grilling. some good flavor combinations for pork tenderloin include     for classic sweet sour pork marinade  mix a quarter cup of olive oil  a clove of minced garlic  and a tablespoon each of brown mustard  soy sauce  brown sugar  with a teaspoon of red pepper flakes if desired. vary the amounts to taste. rub into the meat and refrigerate overnight  turning the meat periodically.  for a spicy sweet marinade  mix a cup of orange juice  a tablespoon of tomato paste and dijon mustard  and a teaspoon each of garlic powder  chilli powder  white sugar  paprika  and worcestershire sauce. add a handful of chopped cilantro to the mix.  for a sweet barbecue style marinade  mix 2 3 cup of molasses and a half cup of brown sugar  a half teaspoon each of red pepper flakes  allspice  salt and pepper  then add 2 4 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar.    after marinating your pork in the cool refrigerator all night  you need to let it sit out on the counter for an hour or so before putting it on the heat  to bring the temperature down and ensure a more even cooking. if the meat is cold through before you put it on the grill  it ll cook unevenly  and it ll be difficult to cook it all the way through without over cooking it.   when you go outside to light the grill  make sure that your pork is sitting out on the counter. that should give you enough time to make sure the meat will warm up gently  rather than go onto the grill stone cold.    some tenderloin lovers like to remove the pork from the marinade and add a dry rub just before the meat goes on the grill. depending on what you ve marinaded the meat in  or if you ve marinaded it at all  you might opt for a stronger or simpler rub  depending. a dry rub can help to create a caramelized crust that can add a different layer of flavor to the meat. you can use commercial dry rubs  or make up your own. whatever you use  take a handful of spice and simply rub it into the meat after adding a bit of olive oil to the outside so it sticks.simple seasoning  rub the tenderloin with about a tablespoon or two of olive oil  then sprinkle the outside liberally with kosher salt and fresh black pepper.  dried spice seasoning  rub the tenderloin with a tablespoon or two of olive oil  and a mixture of a teaspoon each of oregano  cumin powder  coriander powder  garlic powder  and thyme.  fresh herb seasoning  rub the tenderloin with a tablespoon or two of olive oil  then toast up a tablespoon each of fennel seeds  mustard seeds  and coriander seeds in a dry skillet. when they get fragrant  remove them from the pan and crush them in a mortar and pestle  or crush them with the flat side of a kitchen knife. mix with a teaspoon of red pepper flakes  two tablespoons of fresh chopped rosemary  and salt and pepper to taste. massage into the pork.    when your meat s ready to go  you should start the grill about an hour before you plan on eating. you want to give the grill about 20 or 30 minutes to heat up to the proper temperature  it ll be quicker with a gas grill  and about 20 minutes total cooking time  with ten minutes for resting. start it about an hour before you want to eat so you won t  have to rush around.    on the gas grill  you can probably get away with starting the grill a few minutes before you put the meat on. you want to have a cooler spot on the grill  though  so heat a section to one side so you can move the meat elsewhere and let it cook slowly over indirect heat.  on the charcoal grill  pile your coals to one side of the grill and let them reduce to a nice charred ashy glow before you put the meat on. this way  you ll be able to sear them over the coals and move them to the other side of the grill to finish them.    place whole tenderloin first on the hottest side of the grill  closing the lid and letting each side sear for about 2 minutes over the direct heat. leave it alone. after the time has elapsed  turn the meat one quarter turn  letting the next side sear. depending on the size of your tenderloin and the shape of the cut  you may do this four times  or fewer. once the meat has developed a nice brownish char on the outside  you can move it to the cooler part of the grill and let it cook longer at a slightly less severe temperature.    on a charcoal grill  move your pork to the side away from the coals  positioning the meat so that it s not in direct heat. on an electric grill  position the meat next to the heated grate. close the lid to trap the heat in the grill  leaving the top vent on your grill about half open  if your grill has one.many grillers get nervous closing the lid  thinking something terrible is going to happen if you can see the meat the whole time. try to let go of this concern. grilling over extremely high heat with the grill open is inefficient and uneven  making it easy to dry out the pork and overcook it. use the grill the way it was meant to be used  close the lid  set a timer  and kick back while the meat cooks.    over the course of the cooking time  you might open the grill once or twice to turn the pork over and make sure it isn t drying out. keep an eye on the coals to make sure the heat stays up and the temperature in the grill remains relatively constant  but try not to fiddle with it too much. leave the meat alone and let it cook. after 20 minutes  it should be close to done.   if you use a meat thermometer  the internal temperature should be somewhere between 140 to 155 degrees f  68 degrees c .  put your meat on a cutting board  or a platter  and cover with tin foil to let the meat rest before carving it up. it ll be much juicer and more tender if you let it sit for a couple of minutes. resist the urge to dig in    meat isn t rested because it s too hot to eat  it s rested to make it more tasty. meat should be rested to give the exterior a chance to cool slightly  so the juices will reabsorb into the cut  making the meat more flavorful. if you cut into the meat right away  the juices will run all over the plate and you ll lose a lot of flavor.  after resting  slice your tenderloin into thick portions  as much as an inch thick  and serve immediately. pork tenderloin is often great paired with    roasted green beans oven potatoes grilled sweet corn homemade applesauce    if you d rather grill up individual portions to account for particular tastes  want to make grilled tenderloin sandwiches  or you just want to experiment with a few different seasonings  you can remove the tenderloin from the marinade and slice into portions before grilling. slice 3 4 to an inch thick.   consider pounding out the steaks to about a half an inch  using a meat tenderizer. place each steak under a clean towel  then use a tenderizing hammer to bang out the steaks and flatten them. in the midwest  pork tenderloins are pounded out to almost comically large sizes  roughly the size of a plate. put together on a bun  the resulting sandwich should resemble nothing so much as the planet saturn. it s a state fair classic. cutting into steaks and pounding out the meat should be done after the meat has been marinaded  just before you re about to grill them. don t try to marinade pounded out tenderloin.    before grilling  sprinkle your desired seasoning on both sides of the steaks  or simply dress them with a brushing of olive oil  salt  and pepper for a simple and perfect start to a tenderloin sandwich.    lots of flavor comes from searing the meat and creating nice grill marks on the outside of the steaks  then moving the steaks away from direct heat and covering the grill to let them cook for a few more minutes to finish the inside of the meat.   cook for approximately 4 to 6 minutes on each side. if you want to check the temperature  it should be about 155 degrees f  68 degrees c  when it s time to remove the steaks from the grill.    after your tenderloins rest for 10 15 minutes  under tin foil  serve them sandwich style on buns topped with dill pickle  brown mustard  and raw white onion. that s eating.    take a sharp knife and cut the pork lengthwise  approximately 3 4 of the way through. open the cut  flattening the meat out as much as possible.   if you want  you can take a meat tenderizer and hammer out the pork slightly  to open up the tenderloin to hold all the stuffing. depending on how much stuffing you make  it might be necessary. you ll end up tying it up anyway  so feel free to flatten it out considerably.    stuffing tenderloin with a mixture of dry bread  cheese  bacon  and vegetables can up the ante considerably. if you want to kick grilled tenderloin up a couple of notches  stuffing it is the way to go. you can experiment with ingredients that you like  or go with a few tried and true standards.    bacon mushroom stuffing  in a skillet  crisp up 3 4 slices of bacon  then add two cups of white button mushrooms  and a pinch of salt. let the mushrooms sit untouched for one minute  then stir to coat them in the mixture and cook until soft. add 2 cloves of minced garlic and cook until soft. to this  add 2 3 tablespoons of dried breadcrumbs  and a handful of fresh chopped parsley to complete the stuffing mixture.  italian spinach stuffing  in a food processor  add a cup of fresh baby spinach leaves  a half cup of fresh basil  two cloves of garlic  and 2 4 tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese. add a pinch of crushed red pepper  italian seasoning  and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar to finish the stuffing.  bacon wrapped stuffed tenderloin  in a bowl  combine a small finely chopped onion  1 2 stalks of celery  1 2 slices of dry toast  torn into small pieces  3 tablespoons of melted butter  and salt  pepper  and oregano. use this to stuff the tenderloin  then roll it up and wrap the whole thing with 6 8 strips of bacon  around the width of the meat. tie it and grill it as normal. it s a delicious combo.    after you ve flattened it out slightly  you can spread an even layer of whatever stuffing you ve mixed up over the inside of the meat  then either roll it up or truss it up  depending on how flat it is and how thick a layer of stuffing you ve added.   if you want to roll up your tenderloin  spread a thin layer of stuffing on the meat  no more than a quarter inch or so. start rolling the meat on the long flat side  tucking the stuffing on the inside  so it spirals. after you ve rolled it up  tie it to keep it together. if you want to keep the tenderloin more whole  don t pound it out  and stuff your stuffing into the butterfly cut as thickly as you want. wrap it tightly in plastic wrap to get the shape to hold  then you can tie it up with twine before grilling.    wrap a piece of cooking twine around the width of the meat to close up the cut. you don t have to get fancy  just take a few short pieces of twine and tie at least three times around the meat  one in the middle  and one at each end.   if you don t have cooking twine  you can use some kebab skewers to pin the 2 sides of the meat together  pinching it closed. after the meat is cooked  remove the skewers and slice normally.    follow the basic instructions for grilling a whole tenderloin  browning on all sides  then cooking at a cooler part of the grill for about 20 minutes. if you ve got a particularly messy stuffing  you might move the tenderloin onto a piece of tinfoil after moving it to the cooler part of the grill  to collect the mess.   take some care when you re testing the temperature of the meat  so you don t stick the reader into the stuffing  getting an inaccurate reading. the internal temperature of the meat  not the stuffing  should be between 140 and 155 degrees f  68 degrees c  according to a meat thermometer.    don t remove the twine right away  or the meat might start to unroll and come apart. let the stuffed tenderloin rest normally and it ll hold it s shape. after 10 or 15 minutes  remove the twine and slice into inch thick portions  and serve.  
query	92	prevent urinary incontinence prevent male incontinence  many of the underlying causes of incontinence unfortunately cannot be controlled. benign prostatic hypertrophy  neurological disorders  stroke  prostate bladder cancer  etc. cannot be prevented. however  you can take steps to minimize your risk of some of these underlying conditions.    one excellent way to reduce your risk of developing incontinence is to stop smoking. the national institutes of health reports that up to 50  of bladder cancer cases are caused by smoking. pressure in the bladder caused by tumors results in incontinence. if you need help quitting  schedule an appointment with your doctor  who can help you quit. there are prescribed medications to help you  and she can also help you find a local support group.  when you are overweight  extra pressure gets placed on your bladder. this extra pressure on your bladder can lead to incontinence. while losing weight may seem like a daunting task  it will be well worth it in the end. start exercising more and make an effort to eat healthy foods. other ways you can lose weight include making sure that you get the right amount of protein  fruits  vegetables  low fat dairy  and healthy carbohydrates each day. your daily intake of each food group will depend on your weight  age  and health. if you should be consuming 2 000 calories a day  you should eat six to eight servings of grains  four to five servings of veggies  four to five servings of fruit  3   6 ounces of protein  two to three servings of low fat dairy  and two to three servings of fats and oils.developing an exercise routine and sticking to it. your exercise routine should include cardiovascular training  like running or swimming   weight training  like doing push ups or lifting weights   and flexibility training  like yoga or stretching . limiting the portions of each meal you have. choosing low calorie snacks like fruits and vegetables.    research has indicated that men with prostate cancer had 62   75  decreased zinc in malignant prostate cells and that zinc plays a role in the progression of prostate cells to malignancy. the recommendation is for zinc supplementation  but amounts are not clear at present. consult your doctor regarding a healthy amount of zinc supplementation based on the present zinc levels in your diet.  lycopenes are powerful phytonutrients and antioxidants shown to fight cancer. five of the foods highest in lycopenes per cup include guava  8587 uq watermelon  6889 uq tomatoes  7298 uq papaya  2651 uq grapefruit  2611uq    some recent findings have suggested that the isoflavones in soy may help prevent prostate cancer.you can increase the amount of soy in your diet with edamame  soy milk  or tofu.    omega 3 fatty acids are present in a wide array of fish and seafood options  including salmon  mackerel  sardines  and bass. studies have shown that omega 3 s protect against cancers of the breast  colon  and prostate.  drink at least eight glasses of water during the day to prevent conditions such as urinary tract infection  constipation  and kidney stones that cause incontinence. you should also consider drinking most of your fluids during the day and limiting the amount of fluids you drink in the evening before going to bed.    if you are afraid that you may develop incontinence  you can train your bladder to some degree. plan particular times during the day to visit the restroom. this is a way to train your bladder  which helps to avoid incontinence.    substances that can lead to incontinence include alcohol  caffeine  acidic foods  spicy foods  and sugar or artificial sweetener.alcohol is a diuretic  an agent that causes your body to lose fluid. it also irritates the bladder  causing incontinence. try to limit your alcohol intake to one glass per night if at all. caffeine is also a diuretic. drink caffeinated beverages early in the day if at all.    kegel exercises are a great way to prevent incontinence because they strengthen the muscles of your pelvic floor. learning how to do them correctly can be a little tricky because you have to isolate your pelvic muscles. your pelvic muscles are the muscles you use when you try to stop urinating midstream. you will see or feel your testicles rising when you squeeze your pelvic muscles.once you ve isolated your pelvic muscles  squeeze them and hold for a count of five and then relax for a count of five. your goal is to do ten repetitions  three times a day.  a diuretic is a medication that gets rid of extra fluid in the body. this is usually prescribed for patients who have heart conditions. sadly  it also has a tendency to cause incontinence. there are several different kinds of diuretics  thiazide  loop  potassium sparing  and quinazoline diuretics. recognizable diuretic medications include    thiazide diuretics  clorpres  tenoretic  thalitone  capozide  dyazide  hyzaar  lopressor hct  maxzide  and prinzide. loop diuretics  lasix and demadex. potassium sparing diuretics  aldactazide  aldactone  dyazide  and maxzide. quinazoline diuretics  zaroxolyn always consult your doctor before taking yourself off a prescribed medication.    a muscle relaxant is a medication prescribed for certain types of injuries to muscles. it may not come as too much of a surprise that the medications that relax your body also cause incontinence. recognizable muscle relaxants include valium  soma  flexeril  skelaxin  and robaxin. sedatives can also cause incontinence.    an antihypertensive drug is a medication used to lower blood pressure. antihypertensive drugs can be a combination of different kinds of diuretics. if you are using an antihypertensive drug  ask your doctor about other medications available that do not list incontinence as a side effect. recognizable antihypertensive drugs include moduretic  minizide  monopril hct  and accuretic.    overflow incontinence occurs due to an outlet obstruction that then  overflows  to cause incontinence. benign prostatic hypertrophy  bph  is a leading cause because the enlarged prostate pushes against and pinches off the urethra as it passes through the prostate. however  other conditions can also cause the symptoms  which include increased urinary frequency urinary hesitancy  trouble urinating despite needing to  nocturia  going to the restroom at night a lot  weakened urinary stream recurrent urinary tract infections  utis  urinary incontinence occasion urinary retention  cannot urinate at all     while bph is one of the most common causes of overflow incontinence  it s not the only cause. see your doctor and describe your symptoms in order to help him or her determine the correct diagnosis for your specific condition.   a tumor in the bladder or prostate can also lead to overflow incontinence  so your doctor will likely perform a screening to rule out these possibilities. tests will include a prostate specific antigen  psa  test of your blood  a digital rectal exam  dte  to feel for prostate abnormalities  and or a cystoscopy  a tube inserted into the bladder via the urethra to check for a tumor . if the doctor finds a tumor in any of these instances  he or she will like perform a biopsy to determine whether it is benign or malignant.    during your appointment  your doctor will also ask about any medications you take since some of them can lead to overflow incontinence as a side effect. diuretics for cardiac problems  sedatives  and muscle relaxants are common medications that can lead to incontinence issues. some antidepressants  sleeping pills  and high blood pressure medications have also been linked to overflow incontinence.since many of these medications are prescriptions to help with much more serious issues than just incontinence  never stop taking a prescribed medication unless under the guidance of your doctor. though not medications  excess consumption of coffee  tea  alcohol  and vitamins b or c can also lead to overflow incontinence. your doctor can run a blood panel to test if your diet is too high in b and or c vitamins.    for mild to moderate bph symptoms  there are several prescription medications that are available for symptom control such as alpha blockers such as hytrin  which does not actually work to shrink the size of the prostate  but will relieve symptoms within a few weeks 5 alpha reductase inhibitors such as avodart work to reduce the size of the prostate but may not improve symptoms for up to six months cialis  which although originally marketed for erectile dysfunction  ed  improves symptoms of bph as well your doctor may prescribe a combination of avodart and hytrin to have both advantages. this is common  safe  and effective approach to control overflow incontinence.    a transurethral resection of the prostate  turp  is the go to procedure for relieving lower urinary tract outlet obstruction due to enlargement of the prostate blocking of the bladder from emptying.this technique uses an endoscope to enter the urethra and clear or ablate the excessive prostate tissue encroaching on the urethra.the procedure can use anything from a laser or microwave to needle ablation or photoselective vaporization. it is minimally invasive and done as an office procedure in many cases.it may require a secondary operation in a decade due to tissue regrowth.  stress incontinence more often relates to leaking urine than some of the more myriad symptoms associated with overflow incontinence. you may notice the leakage when you laugh  cough  sneeze  jog  or lift heavy objects.  increased pressure on the bladder due to obesity or pregnancy is the most common cause of stress incontinence. stress incontinence can also occur due to a lack of bladder sphincter pressure as a result of surgical complications. surgeries commonly associated with this complication include prostate surgery and transurethral resections of the prostate.stress incontinence can results from 10 20  of turp surgeries or higher percentages from prostate cancer surgery.  your doctor will examine your symptoms and run a variety of tests to determine the best course of action for your case. for obese patients  this may include testing for metabolic disorders  such as underlying thyroid conditions  that may have caused the weight gain.  if your doctor concludes that your weight has placed unnecessary pressure on your bladder  he or she will likely suggest that you lose weight as a primary treatment for the condition.   this will include turning to a healthy  well balanced diet in conjunction with a regular exercise routine. you can find more information at how to lose weight and how to eat healthy. you may want to consult a dietician and a personal trainer to develop the best  healthiest plan for you in order to lose weight.    though known primarily for helping women to improve pelvic floor muscles after pregnancy  men can also perform kegels to help with stress incontinence. perform by clenching the muscles that control urination. you may initially have to practice by cutting off your urinary stream midstream to get a good idea of how the clenches should feel when doing them apart from actually urinating.slowly clench while counting to five before using another five count to slowly release. perform kegels in sets of ten up to three times per day.  for morbidly obese patients  their physician may recommend lap band or other weight loss surgery options. in one study  71  of participants who lost 18  bmi  body mass index  points as a result of gastric bypass surgery had regained urinary continence by one year after the procedure.  urination occurs by a complex arc of nerves communicating with the brain and causing muscles within the bladder and surrounding areas to contract and relax. if you have a neuromuscular disorder such as multiple sclerosis  ms   for example you may experience disruptions in these signals  resulting in a neurogenic bladder. people who have had a stroke can also have a resultant neurogenic bladder if the muscles that cause the bladder muscles to contract and relax are affected.    most of those who have a neurogenic bladder will already be familiar with the underlying causes. however  you should still see your doctor for a positive diagnosis. you doctor will also provide you with the best overview of treatment options and weigh in on which is likely best for your specific situation.    also known as timed voiding  physical psychological therapy combines will power and exercise to help treat the incontinence. this combines kegel exercises  outlined in the method on stress incontinence  and a voiding diary to help you avoid incontinence episodes before they occur.   a voiding diary is a daily record of the fluids you ve taken in  the times and amounts you urinated  and the instances of leakage. you can use this record to help determine the best times to stay close to a bathroom  as well as times when you should force yourself to go  to minimize incontinence episodes.    though no drugs currently target the bladder sphincter to help with neurogenic bladder  some drugs do reduce muscle spasms or induce contractions. your doctor will help determine if one of these classes of medications can help with your specific case.    a variety of difference surgical options are available  depending upon the underlying cause for your neurogenic bladder. your doctor may discuss    electrical stimulatory therapy  which involves electrodes and a small stimulator implanted to help deliver the signals disrupted by the damaged nerves an artificial sphincter  which is a cuff that attaches to the neck of the bladder and works in coordination with an implanted pump and regulating balloon to collect the urine.    an overactive bladder  oab  is a syndrome which leads to an immediate and unstoppable need to urinate.common symptoms of the syndrome include urinary urgency  primary symptom  urgency incontinence  not making it to the toilet quickly enough  high urinary frequency and nocturia  getting up at night to go     your doctor will help you officially diagnose oab as the underlying cause. only 2  of men who suffer from oab experience regular symptoms of incontinence  so your doctor will want to exhaust other potential causes.your doctor will likely perform a physical exam  as well as ordering urinalysis to test your urine and potentially even a cystoscopy in complicated cases.findings also suggest the overactivity of the detrusor muscle  which is found in the wall of the bladder.  treatment involves behavioral therapy with a timed voiding regimen. a timed voiding regimen involves going to urinate at set times for example  every four hours whether or not you actually feel the need to empty your bladder.   this is a bladder retraining regimen  and a form of cognitive behavior therapy. trying to train the bladder to empty at certain times to prevent incontinence. a recent report has shown that biofeedback assisted behavioral therapy  timed voiding  was shown to be superior to pharmacologic therapy with oxybutynin or placebo in patients receiving treatment for detrusor instability.biofeedback is when a patient is attached to some electrodes that measure their subjective  unconscious physiologic responses. that way they can see in plain sight when their body is having a physiologic response  such as the urge to urinate  and attend to their needs  versus a  false alarm.  this ability to see factual data rather than guessing increases their accuracy of judging their bodies cues.    there are some pharmacologic interventions  specifically ditropan  which is dosed as 5 mg twice daily or 5 mg extended release tablet once daily. combination therapies  using combination of behavioral  pharmacologic  and biofeedback are common.
query	93	donate blood type donate your kidney  you can choose to donate a kidney directly to someone you know  but only if you are a compatible match. you also have the option of donating to a stranger or participating in a paired exchange donation  which means you will donate your kidney to a stranger on the condition that a compatible stranger also donates a kidney to your loved one.some kidney transplant centers allow you to be a good samaritan donor  which means you can initiate a chain of donations by donating your kidney to a stranger. when you donate your kidney  the recipient s loved one will donate hers  and so on and so forth. this will probably not directly impact anyone you know personally  but it will help a lot of people. if you don t want to donate your kidney while you are still alive  but you want to help someone after you die  you can register to donate all of your organs or specific organs by signing up on your specific state s registry or indicating your preferences on your driver s license.    once you have decided that you would like to donate a kidney  you must contact a transplant center in order to initiate your application. the transplant center should have a nurse available to answer all of your questions and help you decide if donation is really right for you.if you are donating to a specific person  you must contact the transplant center that has approved them for a transplant. if the person has not yet been approved  you will not be able to proceed with donating your kidney until that happens.if you are not doing a direct donation  you have a choice regarding which facility you work with. contact multiple facilities and ask questions regarding their success rates  their policies for matching donors and recipients  and the financial assistance they offer in order to choose the right one for you. consult the u.s. department of health and human services  organ procurement and transplantation network for a complete list of transplant centers in the united states.  if you want to donate to a specific person  you will need to undergo blood testing to determine if you are a match. the initial screening involves a simple blood test.you must have a compatible blood type in order to donate your kidney to a specific individual. people who have type a blood can accept blood from donors with type a or type o. people with type b blood can receive blood from people with type b or type o. people with type ab blood can receive blood from someone with any blood type. people with type o blood can only receive blood from a donor with type o blood. the antibodies in your blood must also be compatible with those in the recipient s blood. in general  the more antibodies that recipient has  the more difficult it will be to find a match. doctors also consider antigen matching. you do not need to be an exact match in order to donate  but research has found that an exact match does increase the success rate of the transplant. if you have passed all of the other tests  doctors will then perform a cross matching test  which may actually be a series of several tests. doctors will collect cells and serum  blood without the cells in it  from both the donor and the recipient and mix them together to see if the recipient s body is likely to reject the donor s organ. if these tests come back negative  you will be considered a match. keep in mind that if you are not a match for your loved one  you still have the option of participating in a paired exchange donation program  which will greatly increase the chances that your loved one will receive a kidney in a timely fashion.  in order to donate a kidney  you must be healthy enough to undergo surgery and to do well afterward with only one kidney. you also must have a sufficiently low risk of developing kidney problems in the future.your doctor will likely perform blood tests  urine tests  x rays  an ekg  and a ct angiogram to check your overall health and look for any abnormalities of your kidneys.certain chronic conditions  such as diabetes and liver disease  may disqualify you from donating your kidney. if you are a smoker  you will be required to quit at least one month before undergoing surgery to have your kidney removed.you may also be disqualified from donating a kidney if you have certain diseases that could be passed on to the recipient  such as hiv or hepatitis. you will also be required to undergo a psychological examination in order to confirm that you are aware of the risks of donating your kidney and are choosing to do it of your own free will. if you have any health conditions  you might require a pre surgical clearance from your treating doctor in order to be approved for surgery.    donating a kidney requires that you undergo major surgery  and this is not without risks. make sure to talk to your doctor about the risks before you agree to undergo surgery  and always ask if you have an increased risk of complications for any reason. although rare  some risks of surgery include the following bleeding infection blood clots in the lung  pulmonary embolism  death    kidney donors do not usually have shorter lifespans or a diminished quality of life as a result of the surgery.there are  however  some long term risks to keep in mind.   while your body is perfectly capable of functioning normally with only one kidney  you will be at a disadvantage should your remaining kidney fail. if you end up needing a kidney transplant  you will be given preference as a prior donor.kidney donors may have a somewhat higher chance of developing high blood pressure.having only one kidney may prevent you from being eligible for certain military  police  and fire fighting jobs.  most of the time  your medical expenses will be covered by either the recipient s insurance or by the transplant center if you choose to donate a kidney. make sure to find out if you will be responsible for any costs. also  keep in mind that the surgery may have many hidden costs that are not covered. the following expenses are typically not covered  although you may be able to get help with them by contacting a nonprofit agency expenses for travel to and from the transplant center childcare lost wages during your recovery period medical expenses related to long term surgical complications    there are two different surgeries your doctor may perform to remove your kidney  an open incision removal and a laparoscopic procedure. the laparoscopic procedure is much less invasive  which means there are fewer risks involved and the recovery time is shorter.a laparoscopic procedure means that instead of making a large incision and the surgeon using their hands to do the surgery inside your body  a very small set of incisions are made and instruments with long handles are inserted into the holes. the surgeon uses the instruments to do the surgery without ever opening up the abdomen. the laparoscopic procedure may not be an option for all patients  depending on their surgical histories and the anatomy of the individual s kidney and whether it can be accessed and removed with the laparoscopic instruments alone.    your doctor will give you specific instructions that you must follow prior to surgery. most commonly  you will be restricted from eating and drinking in the hours leading up to your surgery  usually beginning the night before. this is to prevent aspiration of food into your lungs when you are under anesthesia. it is very important to follow these and all other instructions  as they are meant to reduce your risk of surgical complications.make sure your doctor knows about all of the medications you are taking. you may be required to stop some medications prior to surgery.    depending on the type of surgery and a host of personal factors  recovery typically takes anywhere between one and six weeks. you should expect to experience pain  discomfort  and fatigue while you recover.it s a good idea to have a caretaker available to help you with daily activities  like preparing meals and you may have to spend a few days recovering in the hospital before you are sent home. people who are in good shape tend to recover from surgery faster than people who are out of shape  so you might want to begin an exercise regimen before your surgery.moving around in the days following your surgery will help you avoid complications  such as blood clots.  your doctor will probably have you come in for at least one post surgical check up. the purpose of this is to make sure you are healing properly  so be sure to go to all scheduled appointments.it is also important to continue getting regular medical checkups throughout your life. your doctor may want to monitor your kidney function to make sure your remaining kidney is functioning properly.    when you are released from the hospital  your doctor will give you a list of activities that you should avoid for certain periods of time. these restrictions are meant to help you heal and to protect you from injury  so it is very important that you follow them.you should not do any heavy lifting in the weeks following your surgery. your doctor will provide you with specific guidelines. depending on the type of work you do  you may not be medically cleared to return to work for several weeks. the more strenuous your job  the longer you will be out of work. women are typically advised not to become pregnant for six months after donating a kidney. some doctors recommend that kidney donors avoid contact sports like football and wrestling  due to the potential for injury to your remaining kidney.

political beliefs changed over time    what issues matter to you the most      make a point to learn the history of major political parties to gain a better understanding of what they really stand for. for example  most major european and north american political parties emerged in the 19th century as groups of individuals organized to gain and exert political power.over time  the platforms  or values  of each party have shifted in response to cultural and political issues of the day. understanding how each political party in your nation originated and evolved is key to understanding whether or not you agree with their positions on important issues.  the number of major political parties varies by nation  but as a general rule most parties fall somewhere between liberal and conservative ideologies. learn what these belief structures represent to get a better sense of your own political sensibilities. liberal parties support a belief that government should guarantee equality  provide for its citizens  and alleviate social problems.conservative parties emphasize personal liberty  free markets  strong national defense  and limited government interference.also referred to as  left

beliefs and priorities in this area when determining your political stance. as a general rule  conservatives support private health care  distributed by the market with minimal government interference

education is a topic of great importance that you should think about carefully  whether you have children or simply have strong opinions about the educational system. left wing parties believe in the public school system  and feel that the government should direct more money towards improving these schools. right wing parties tend to support a more privatized education system  where scholarships may be awarded to students for private or charter schools  public schools operating independently  the idea is that competition created by this scholarship or school voucher system will improve the quality of education.  left wing and right wing ideas about taxation and welfare are vastly different  the former supports higher taxes and a larger government to provide for the less fortunate  while

taxpayer  to further evaluate your overall public stance.    liberal and conservative beliefs differ greatly on environmental issues  particularly on the subject of climate change. liberals believe that global warming is the result of excessive burning of fossil fuels and support laws to reduce carbon emissions  along the same lines  they believe that the government should subsidize programs to find alternative energy sources. many conservatives dismiss the notion that humans can have that effect on the climate and oppose laws to reduce emissions.do some research to better understand the

get established.    apply for every sports writing position you can  whether it is baseball specific or not. once you get an entry level position  keep looking  so that you can move up to a baseball writing position that will pay the bills.   be prepared to take a non sports journalism job at first to get some experience. if this happens  look for opportunities to write about something sports

thousands of unique cards that have been printed and could potentially be used against you.regular play will teach you how to best respond to in game developments with your tournament deck s  and common scenarios that occur in the various styles of tournament play.   when practicing  focus on the quality of your play over mere quantity. if you are distracted  it s not likely you ll play your best game or take away as much as you would if you were rested  focused  and in a good mental state. make mental notes of your game as you play. turning points are especially important  as these will help you evaluate things like the timing of your plays  the best instances to use certain strategies  and more. online play has created an invaluable resource to serious magic players. even if you live in an area where local  regional  national  or international tournaments aren t accessible  with an internet connection you can easily practice against other players. speaking of local  regional  national  and international tournaments  these are vital events where you can test your skill as a planeswalker. you ll also be able to watch games between other pros during your free moments  which will give you a chance to scope out their cards and strategies.    each of your tournament decks should have a goal that actively works against your opponent. every play you make should be a step towards achieving that goal. even if you feel out of your depth or hopelessly at a disadvantage  a lucky draw could keep you in the game or poorly timed execution by your opponent could return the advantage to you.   the goal of your deck shouldn t be too narrow or broad. for example  simply removing an opponent s creature from play could blind you to the larger strategic goals of your opponent  while  playing to win  doesn t give you a firm plan with which you can undo your enemy. having a goal for you deck and knowing it well will also make your deck more versatile. there may be slight modifications you can make to your normal play style that throws a wrench into the machinations of the opposition. try to keep an open mind to every way possible you might achieve the goal of your deck.  in the heat of the moment  even veteran players can make poor judgement calls. a minor oversight can lose you in game tempo or allow your adversary the wiggle room he needs to execute his own strategy. mistakes can lead you to being overly hard on yourself  but each of these is an opportunity for you to learn more.   take special note of instances where you notice you could have done something better. analyze these to learn the signs and indicators that might tip you off next time you are in a similar situation. predictive play can undo an opponent before he even gets a chance to make his move. technical errors will also help you learn the most optimal order in which you should execute your strategy. different situations may require you to alter your order of play. by recognizing enemy moves before they happen and adjusting your own strategy to compensate  you ll stand the best chance of winning possible.  consistent losses in the same fashion might indicate a flaw in the build of your deck. an improper distribution of card types could make your chances of drawing the cards you need for victory unlikely. you might also notice that you re always regretting a certain card in your deck  these cards can often be exchanged for ones that are more helpful.   some of your tournament decks might simply be ill equipped to handle certain strategies. if you find your deck has an achilles heel  consider ways you might protect yourself from this disadvantage. if you find this is impossible  you should evaluate whether or not that particular deck is worth taking to tournament. your in game experiences can reveal unexpected flaws in your deck. some cards and strategies work well on paper  but that doesn t always mean these work the best in real life.  there are plenty of online resources  like channel fireball  that analyze strategies  probabilities  techniques  and more. you can also learn variations of your own strategy and the strategies of others by watching how players execute these at tournaments.   you should also be aware of changes in rules and requirements. you may have to rethink your strategy if a previously disallowed card or card type is permitted in the format of tournament play you specialize  like constructed or limited matches.weigh your deck strategy against other dominant strategies that pros advocate. if you find your deck strategy can t hold its own against those of advanced players  you may need to make adjustments or even start from scratch. after spending time  effort  and money building your deck to achieve a certain goal or enact a certain strategy  it can be difficult admitting it isn t good enough to go toe to toe with other pros. the hallmark of a true pro is adaptability  never be too proud to optimize your play style.  even if you diligently analyze every game you play and note technical errors and deck weaknesses  if you are pretentious and look down on other players you may overlook game changing details. even lower tier players may have strategies you need to account for  although these may be inexpertly executed.   many serious player of magic  sharing the same passion for the game you do  can become valuable allies and advisers. never hesitate to ask questions  and always demonstrate good sportsmanship.  now that you ve done your research and gauged your strategy against those of other top tier players  you ll need to hunt for the right cards to neutralize the strategies that might undo your own. this can be an expensive and time intensive challenge. first    use online card catalogs to find your ideal deck. some of these cards may be ultra rare or outside of your price range. however  there might be ways you can accomplish the same effect as these  super cards  with combinations of more accessible cards. rank these from most to least important. then... begin gathering the components of your ideal deck. you may find you need to start with the cheapest  most accessible cards. you might then use these to win money at regional tournaments and reinvest the prize money in the more expensive  less accessible cards. on the other hand  you might find you need to save up and purchase a super card that s a lynch pin of your strategy. in either case  don t forget to... play test changes to your deck. this can be a painful experience. after going to the effort of attaining a super card  finding out in a play test that it simply does not work can be heartbreaking. however  keep in mind the card will still have value to other players. even if this card doesn t work out  you can sell it or trade it to help you get the cards you need.  there are many routes you can take to reach the pro circuit and the pro tour hall of fame  and which of these is right for you will depend on your individual situation. you may be limited by finances  travel restrictions  or the need for a chaperon in the event you are a minor. however  the three main ways you can qualify for pro play include    earning 33 match points  which is equal to winning 11 of 16 rounds  in previous year s pro tour. qualifying for the pro tour through official qualifier tournaments  ptq . this may also require placing in the tournament or making the point requirement for a regional pro tour qualifiers  rptq . winning enough points or entering the single elimination stage in an official grand prix. in the event you are playing in a grand prix with less than 1200 players  you may be required to place in the top four.note  the qualifying rules can change considerably from year to year. be sure to check the official magic  the gathering qualifying conditions on the wizards of the coast homepage.    even the best build deck can be undone by a string of bad draws. luck of the draw is a definite contributing factor in any of your games  and letting bad luck sour your mood can result in poor play in the instances you do have control.   the same is true for good luck. if you are having a phenomenal string of wins  any pro will tell you    you re having a string of good luck. which isn t to say you haven t worked hard to build your deck and plan your strategy  but overconfidence can lead to serious blunders. if you find that you get overly emotional during games  or if you find that high tension games get the better of you  you might try meditation or other self calming techniques. a surge of adrenaline can lead to a hasty mistake  learn to control adrenaline.  although most pros relate the importance of  living  breathing  and eating  magic to quickly improve your game  playing too much without rest can ruin your drive. many successful competitive players relate how they organize their tournament and practice schedules to make time for other hobbies  family  and romance  and you should too.your hard work will be even more meaningful when it pays off if you have someone to share it with    before plunging headlong into the pro circuit  you may want to use a trial run to see how you hold up. you may find the travel and practice schedule too intense  in which case you might decide not to invest as much time and money into magic  instead keeping it as a hobby. the drive to become the very best is an important factor for any top tier player in any professional sport. however  if this gets out of hand  it can have a serious negative impact on your life. be sure you are taking time to relax and unwind in whatever way you find most valuable.  this does not mean that you should give up your practice schedule when the going gets tough or that you ll eventually get bored with magic. this does mean that there will be times  as with any sport  when you feel you are on a plateau or that you are stuck in a boring cycle. many professional athletes experience this  the difference between a pro and a dabbler is that a pro never gives up.
query	118	operate route singapore airlines find a low airfare  don t assume that all online travel agencies have the same fares. they don t. especially on international fares  one of these online travel agencies could have a fare several hundreds dollars less or higher than another. it is not uncommon for one site to have tickets that aren t even available on another site. check all the online agencies  and use multi site search engines.   for example  in one search test  travelocity was selling seats to london on virgin for  400  470 round trip  taxes included  from east and west coast cities  even for peak summer travel. those fares were only available on travelocity  not orbitz or expedia  they weren t even available on virgin s own site .    increasingly  some airlines have  private  sales  reserving their very best fares for their own sites. with the exception of southwest  which sells fares on its own site exclusively  most of the airlines that do this are smaller domestic airlines or large international carriers  but even delta has done it  and not just for last minute weekend fares.   alaska  air new zealand  malaysia  frontier  qantas  singapore  sas  varig and others are using this strategy. low cost carriers like usa3000 and allegiant air usually don t share their fare data with third party sites at all  although jetblue fares are included in travelocity  cheapair.com and kayak searches now  and usa3000 fares in sidestep.    if you re at all flexible  you can sometimes save hundreds by adjusting your travel dates  often by just a day or two.   travelocity has one of the most useful flexible date search options in the industry because it searches 330 days ahead  although it no longer includes international flights  of course  it s limited  as all many online agencies are  by its exclusion of southwest and several small domestic carriers such as usa3000 and allegiant air . to use this feature  simply click on the  flexible dates  button just below the  to  and  from  boxes on the flight search engine  check these step by step instructions if you re unsure how this works . try travelocity s asian affiliate zuji.com . this contains international flexible searches listed in us dollars  they also show business and first class flexible date results . cheapair.com has a flexible search that also goes out 330 days but it charges  10 per booking vs. travelocity s  5. orbitz has a limited flexible date function that searches a span of only 30 days  click on  flexible dates  . expedia does flexible search only between a few dozen major us cities  click on  my travel dates are flexible  . sidestep.com and the other major sites have no flexible search capability. increasingly  individual airline sites are improving their flexible date search functions. american  aerlingus  air new zealand  spirit  and usa3000 all have decent ones and southwest and us airways have good ones.    last minute weekend fares are often great deals  but most people don t realize that they can construct itineraries by combining two of these fares. let s say you want to fly from boston to san antonio next weekend  and you ve signed up for all the weekly newsletters alerting you of these deals but there s no boston san antonio deals listed. however  if there s a boston to atlanta fare for  128 round trip  and an atlanta to san antonio fare for  108 round trip  then there is indeed a boston san antonio fare as well. just buy two separate fares  travelocity and some other sites do a good job of combining weekend fares in this manner . you can even combine such fares on two different airlines  but make sure you leave enough time in between connecting flights in case there s a delay.    southwest offers daily  ding  deals that pop up on your computer  announced by an audible  ding   thus the name  that can save a few bucks off their already low fares at http   www.southwest.com ding. frontier airlines has begun sending out similar fares by email. in both cases  the fares expire the same day they re announced but they re often good for travel far into the future. frontier doesn t list its excellent weekend fares anywhere but on their own site at flyfrontier.com.    it s often cheaper to buy an air hotel package rather than airfare alone. by  cheaper   this means that the total package with hotel is often less than the airfare without the hotel component.   site59.com is the online leader in this field. travelocity owns site59  so you ll often see  totaltrip  options on travelocity just above the airfare only search results. don t ignore these deals  usually  they work best only if there are two of you traveling  since the hotels are based on double occupancy. they re especially useful for last minute travel. tour operators and your local travel agent also sell packages that might save you money  although not necessarily on last minute deals.    some of the best  blooper  fares and other low fares show up on saturday mornings. here are the best theories as to why this is so    airlines can only change fares once a day  around 5 pm  on saturday and sunday. so  if you re an airline fare analyst  and you re trying to sneak one over your competition  you ll do it with the last fare change on friday night  which appears in travelocity  orbitz  etc. around 1 or 2 am on saturday morning. your competition can t match your sale fares until the 5 pm saturday update  those fares appear in travelocity around 8 or 9 pm that night . airfare analysts work under a great deal of pressure  and when they feeling this way  they are they most likely to enter a fare typo into their computer systems. the most likely time for this is probably on friday night  after a long hard week  with the 10 pm fare update  after all  they re human  they ve had a hard week  and mistakes do happen . and these 10 pm fare mistakes stick around until the 5 pm saturday update  so you have all day saturday to snag them.    because airfares fluctuate like the stock market  you need to check them every day  sometimes two or three times a day  if you re serious about saving money. airlines can update domestic fares three times a day during the week  at 10 am  12.30 pm  and 8 pm est   and once on saturday and sunday at 5 pm est  international fares are updated just once a day .   and another little tip  be sure to clear the  cookies  on your internet browser  on explorer you do this under the  tools  menu and  internet options  sub menu . why do this  if a fare changes between two separate searches done over time on the same route  some fare search engines may return the results you viewed earlier rather than the new  lower results.    say you re flying from new york to eleuthera in the bahamas. check on one of the big sites like expedia or orbitz for a single fare  for example  jfk to governor s harbor  bahamas  and then do two separate searches  jfk to nassau and nassau to governor s harbor . since jetblue flies jfk nassau you ll want to check jetblue.com separately . chances are  the two fare strategy will save you a lot of cash. this fare trick also works for flights to europe  fly into london or manchester  uk on one fare and then hop on a discount european airline to reach your final destination  and asia. to search route possibilities on these discounters  check out the airfarewatchdog route maps page.   note  however  that this approach is quite a gamble that only pays off if you manage to make your connecting flight on time. if you don t  it s your problem as opposed to the airlines   to provide hotel accommodation and a new connecting flight. even in a best case scenario  you ll need extra layover time to be able to claim and recheck your luggage.    let s say you ve done your best to find the lowest fare  and then the day after purchase your non refundable fare goes down  100. sure  if you ask for it you can get a refund for the difference  providing of course that you don t change the times or dates of your flights  and the only thing that changed was the price   but it s a little known fact that some airlines will charge you a  service  or  administrative  fee as high as  100 for domestic fares or from  200  300 on international ones  wiping out any savings. united  however  will give you the entire fare difference without extracting a fee  as will jetblue as long as you accept the reimbursement in the form of a voucher good for future travel. northwest charges just  25  for both domestic and international fares. american and delta extract the  100  300 fees  southwest gives you cash back without charging a fee. even on these less generous airlines  however  there have been plenty of instances where a polite entreaty will get you a full fare difference refund without the penalties  so it s worth a try.

business related activities in connection with your employment in your home country.generally speaking  these activities include reviewing and signing a contract  meeting with clients of your employer  or activities related to a sales or manufacturing contract  such as inspecting or overseeing a facility. under no circumstances are you allowed to draw a salary or be directly employed by a u.s. company. this can be a problem if  for example  you are a managerial employee of an international company and are visiting offices in the u.s. in these circumstances  uscis agents may consider you to be employed in the u.s. if you re staying for an extended period of time and an american is your direct supervisor.    if you are in the u.s. on a b1 visa and want to do something that isn t included on the list of eligible activities  you must apply for a change of status first. you cannot begin the prohibited activity until your application is approved.for example  if you are in the u.s. on a b1 visa and want to take some university classes while you are here  you cannot do so until you ve applied for an adjustment of status from business visa to student visa. if you have a b1 visa  you ll use form i 539 for an adjustment of status. you can download this form from the uscis website along with instructions. do not enroll in any courses at an american college or university until your application has been approved. otherwise  your enrollment will be considered a violation of your b1 business visa and your visa will immediately become void.    if you have any questions or concerns about activities you re conducting   or need to conduct   while you re in the u.s.  an experienced immigration attorney can help you evaluate your circumstances.if you re unfamiliar with immigration attorneys  you might ask business associates for a recommendation   particularly those from your home country who have immigrated to the united states. you also might consider talking to anyone who helped you with the process of applying for your b1 visa. this is an especially good option if your employer has an international travel department that worked on getting your visa to travel to the u.s. most immigration attorneys provide a free initial consultation  so you can use that time to figure out your options and decide what your next steps need to be.    generally  h 1b visas are available for temporary workers who want to work in the u.s. for a short period of time but have no intent to become permanent residents.one of the most essential criteria is that you must have a valid employer employee relationship with the person or entity that files a petition on your behalf. if you are a business owner  you may be able to establish this relationship by proving that the employer filing your petition has the right to control your employment. for example  you may own your own business in your home country  but be working with a larger corporation in the u.s. you are required to come into the offices at a certain time each day and be on site certain days of the week. the u.s. employer has control over your employment. most commonly  h 1b visa holders have at least a bachelor s degree and are working in a field related to their course of study.    to be eligible for an h 1b visa  you must have a u.s. employer to sponsor you. that employer must complete an i 129 petition and submit it to the uscis on your behalf.your employer can download the i 129 form from the uscis website. the form is six pages long and includes an additional page for explanations. there are instructions for the form in a separate document  also available on the uscis website. your employer must submit supporting documents along with the petition. these documents will vary depending on the information your employer needs to support. generally your employer must provide documents that prove the employer employee relationship. the petition and supporting documents must be filed as soon as possible. delays in receiving the petition can result in complications and problems with your application.    to change your immigration status to one that allows you to work in the u.s.  you must apply for a change in status with the uscis. for b1 visa holders  this is accomplished using form i 539.you ll have to provide information about you  your current visa status  and the change you are requesting. you also must answer a series of yes no questions. make sure you answer these questions truthfully  and submit supporting documentation where necessary. you may want to make a list of all supporting documentation you need so you can gather those documents together and make copies. don t send originals to the uscis   you won t get them back.    your forms and all supporting documents must be mailed to the uscis at the appropriate lockbox along with any filing fees. check the uscis website to find out which lockbox you should use.get a cashier s check or money order to cover your filing fees    290 for a form i 539 and supporting documents. your check must be drawn on a u.s. bank and payable in u.s. currency. make your check out to  u.s. department of homeland security.  do not abbreviate any part of the name of the department  or use initials. make a copy of the entire packet  including the check  for your records before you mail it. mail your application using u.s. first class mail only.    once your application is received  you ll get a receipt notice from the uscis in the mail. the notice includes an application number along with an estimated processing time.keep in mind that you cannot start working for the u.s. employer who filed a petition on your behalf until your application is approved. once you have this number  you can register on the uscis website to receive automatic notifications when your application status changes in any way. keep in mind that the issuance of h 1b visas is limited to 65 000 per year  and this limit is met quickly. some people  such as those working at universities  are not subject to this cap. if you re applying later in the year  you may have to wait an entire year or longer for your application to be considered. make sure an h 1b visa number is available at the time you apply.    the uscis may require proof of return travel arrangements prior to granting your b1 business visa. if circumstances change and you need to extend your stay  you should make new travel arrangements back to your home country.return travel arrangements help prove that you do not intend to immigrate to the u.s.  and have plans to return home after a short stay. if your initial return travel arrangements don t take place until after your b1 business visa expires  the uscis may interpret that as a sign that you intended to overstay your visa from the outset. keep in mind that if the uscis determines that anything in your original visa application was false  it can rescind your visa. then you must leave the country immediately or be considered in violation of your visa.    your passport must remain valid for the entirety of your stay in the u.s. this means if you need to extend your stay  you need to make sure your passport will be valid for the duration of the extended time you request.keep in mind that if your passport expires while you are in the u.s.  you may not be able to re enter your home country. if you need to extend your b1 business visa and your passport will be expiring soon  you may have to travel back to your home country to renew your visa and then return. keep in mind that a b1 business visa normally becomes void when you leave north america  so you d have to apply for a new one. talk to a uscis agent or an experienced immigration attorney about your ability to travel back to your home country and return with a b1 business visa.    the important deadline is the date your i 94 travel document expires. the date of the expiration of any visa stamps on your passport is irrelevant.your i 94 document was issued by a border patrol agent at the port of entry when you entered the u.s. if you no longer have a copy  you can download one from the u.s. customs and border patrol website. if your original b1 visa allows you to stay in the country for anywhere from four to six months  you should generally avoid filing an application for an extension within the first 90 days you re in the country. when you file an extension soon after you enter the country  the uscis may interpret this as a sign that you were planning on extending it when you made your initial application. processing an extension can take time. if you need to extend your stay without first leaving the u.s.  apply for an extension at least 45 days before the expiration date on your i 94. if your reasons for needing an extension came up at the last minute  contact an experienced immigration attorney as soon as possible   particularly if you re worried your application won t be received before your current visa expires.    your application must be accompanied by proof of the reasons you need to extend your stay in the u.s.  that you can support yourself financially  and that you have plans to return home.you also must include documentation that proves your ties to your home country. this could be the deed to a home or an active lease. the presence of close family and continuing employment in your home country also can prove that you have no intention of immigrating to the u.s. proof could include  for example  a letter from your employer in your home country that explains the reasons that you need to remain in the u.s. for a longer period of time and discusses your continued employment and pay.    to extend the period of time you remain in the u.s. under a b1 business visa  you must file form i 539. this form is used to adjust status  but it also is used to request an extension of an existing temporary visa.you can download a form i 539 from the uscis website. fill it out completely and accurately  and submit it along with the required filing fee  a u.s. check or money order for  290  made out to the u.s. department of homeland security  and supporting documentation. you can find the address to which you should mail your application for an extension on the uscis website. the uscis uses lockboxes located all over the country  and which one you need to use depends on where you are located. make a copy of everything you re submitting to the uscis for your records before you submit it  then mail the entire package using u.s. first class mail.    it will take at least 90 days for the uscis to process your application. if your b1 visa expires in the meantime  you generally will still be considered  in status   that is  you won t be violating your visa  while you wait.you ll get a receipt notice in the mail when the uscis has officially received your application materials. this notice includes a number that you can use to get updated information on the status of your case. you can register for status notifications online  or call the uscis customer service center at 1 800 375 5283. if anything happens while you re waiting for a

query	123	work lawyer abraham lincoln make an abraham lincoln costume  lincoln may have had a lot of folk sense in him  but he never turned down an opportunity to look civilized and classy. his dress of choice was always a black overcoat. so long as the coat doesn t have any visible logos or symbols  you can use any black overcoat for this.look at existing lincoln costumes or pictures of the man himself and decide if any coat you have fits the bill.   a grey vest underneath may help to round off your costume.however  if you can t find one of those  a white dress shirt will do. you may also choose to button up your overcoat.    top hats can be found at costume or consignment stores  or made by rolling black felt and gluing on a rim. provided you re aiming for a traditional lincoln costume  you should keep the hat black. top hats often come with pre fabricated lincoln costumes.if you can t find a top hat  make your own. roll black construction paper into a tube. stand it up on another sheet of black construction paper  and trace the circle around the bottom  use a pencil so the silvery graphite will show up . fold the paper in half so that the circle is exactly in half  cut out the circle  and cut a second circle out around the edge  so that you end up with a brim for your top hat. tape it to the black tube.    although they won t attract as much attention as your coat or top hat  it s nonetheless a good idea to round off your costume with a good set of black shoes. the most important thing is that your shoes are black  this way they won t conflict with the rest of the costume. shoes with a buckle are rarer today than they were then  but they also match the costume if you have them lying around.   lincoln wore size 14 shoes. lincoln s father was a shoemaker.  they are not commonly worn in fashion today but you can usually find them for sale at department stores and costume shops. bowties don t need to be done up perfectly. rather  an imperfect bowtie will give your costume that much more character. lincolns bowties were obviously hand tied  but pre tied bowties are available as well if you don t want to bother with the tying process.to hand tie a bowtie  loop the bowtie around your neck  leaving a few inches more on one side. draw the longer end under the other side of your tie and loop it through the center  tightening it as you go along. bring the longer end of the bowtie over the other end and pinch them in the middle  looping the longer end through a hole at the back. tighten it gently.  lincoln s beard was arguably his most distinctive attribute. his beard was based around the chin and allowed to grow quite bushy  without hiding his shirt collar.look at pictures of lincoln s beard and groom your facial hair to match this. you can also make a fake beard with construction paper or brown felt. use spirit gum to attach it to your face.   although he s remembered for his beard  there were points in his life where abraham lincoln shaved his beard. a woman named grace bedell convinced him to grow it out. this had the effect of making lincoln look more trustworthy and warm.  eyebrows are a distinctive trait of lincoln s.although not quite as iconic as the beard  they should be considered if you want to make a convincing lincoln costume. either purchase some fake eyebrows from a costume store  or make some of your own by gluing pipe cleaner onto thin strips of brown construction paper. from there  you can glue them to your face using spirit gum.    lincoln had a very striking face  with sunken cheeks and protruding cheekbones. one way to replicate this look is by using stage makeup. you should first suck n your cheeks. this way  you ll be able to see where the contours of your face are. next  take a grey or brown stage makeup and apply it to the area that s sucked in. blend the edges with your fingers.   because  gaunt cheek  makeup is usually reserved for horror costumes  it s a good idea to be very moderate with the makeup you use here  provided you re going for a  realistic  lincoln.you can try different variations on makeup to create different looks. a  zombie  abe lincoln can be done by using lots of white with black around the eyes.  lincoln was known for preferring to keep his hair unruly  as opposed to smooth. if your hair length is approximately that of lincoln s  you should tousle it up by rubbing your hands coarsely through it. if your hair is quite long  you can get some of the same untidy impression by trapping all of your hair under your top hat and letting a few strands hang loose.    there are endless creative ways you can spruce up a costume once you have the basics down. because abraham lincoln was a politician  you might consider making a pin that says  vote abraham lincoln  on it and pinning it to your jacket. the real lincoln was also often seen holding pocket watches  so adding one to your costume may be a good idea for the fake of authenticity.   a walking cane is always a good add on to a costume of this nature.    a good costume maker won t be limited to the most obvious costume solutions. in truth  there s a virtually endless amount of ways you can make yourself look like lincoln  without even wearing the proper clothes for it. for instance  you could use paper and black spray painted cardboard cutouts to make the costume s  coat  and  hat   then tie the pieces around your body. this approach can be called the  paper raham lincoln  costume.   don t underestimate the effect of multiple layers in a fake materials based costume. for instance a  dress shirt  underneath the cardboard coat could be made by cutting out some of the cardboard in the middle and gluing white construction paper    this often takes the form of combining the costume with a skirt and heels in order to feminize it. the  babe raham  lincoln costume is a well known example of this. you can exchange the big coat and pants for a black skirt and blouse. the only part of the original costume you should keep is the hat and chin beard.   the baba raham lincoln costume is a spoof of  sexy  versions of halloween costumes. it can be worn by men and women alike.    because there are countless things you can do with a costume  don t be afraid to splice your abe lincoln design with other costumes. for instance  a cute cat costume can be merged with a lincoln costume by taking the whiskers and ears  and throwing them together with the chin beard and top hat. if you have a stockpile of costume materials  you should experiment with different combinations using what you already have.   you get bonus points if you re able to make abraham lincoln pun from the combination you ve created.    lincoln was no pushover  but all of his recorded speeches make him out to be a very down to earth  respectable and noble minded speaker. if you want to be a great abraham lincoln  you should act with nobility no matter where you are. keep your volume levelled  and don t speak out of turn. however  when you do speak  you should do so with force and conviction. this manner of speaking is a good part    if you want to go the extra mile  try to nail his likely accent. compared to modern accents  lincoln might be pegged somewhere between a kentucky and indiana accent.look up examples of these accents and pick up on the ways in which particular sounds are inflected. contrary to what you d think  many accounts state that lincoln had a soft  light voice   like a bird .   actors have tried to replicate lincoln s way of speaking. look at a reading of lincoln s speech and get a hang for the way an actor will inflect his voice.  although no recordings of lincoln s speech exist  historians have done research and concluded that lincoln

query	124	pass a turing test alan turing plant turing sunflowers  tall varieties of sunflowers require lots of sun and a sheltered position. tall flower heads can bend over in moderate winds  which can cause their stems to break.    you can also use fairly deep  large containers and planters but they might need weighing down to prevent the tall plant from tipping them over. heavy based pots are better  such as ones made of stone or terracotta.    birds love sunflower seeds. you may find birds will peck and scatter the seed heads  which can make a big mess underneath the sunflowers.   the scattering of seeds also means that some of your sunflowers may self sow  which means sunflowers might start growing in the general vicinity of the original sunflower.    it s best to wait until the frosts are over if you want to plant your sunflowers outdoors.   alternately  you can start your sunflowers off in a pot indoors in the early spring and then move them outdoors in late spring once all risk of frost is over.    weed the area where you plan to plant your sunflower. you can help improve soil fertility by mixing some compost into the soil.    to plant this tall variety of sunflowers  start planting in the spring. you can easily buy packets of seeds in gardening stores or online and they are some of the cheapest flower seeds to buy.   you may have less luck using seeds you have gathered yourself from previous year s sunflower harvest as these aren t always fertile.    plant the seeds about one inch deep into the compost you have mixed into your soil. leave about 20 inches  50.8 cm  of space between seeds  then water the area well. keep the soil moist until the sunflowers have sprouted.   sprouting can take two to three weeks.    some gardeners like to plant two seeds together as not all of them will sprout. if both seedlings emerge  you can remove and discard the one that looks less strong  or transplant the seedling to another position at least 20 inches  50.8 cm  away.    once the sunflower gets to be about waist height  you might want to give the plant some support using a tall  sturdy garden stake or cane. drive this into the ground fairly deeply and then loosely tie the sunflower stalk to the cane.   you may want to tie the plant in another place further up the stem as it grows.    remember to give your sunflower some water during dry periods. make sure not to over water your plant because sunflowers do not generally like having soggy feet.    slugs and snails may attack the young plants so you might consider covering them with a clear plastic bottle with the funnel end cut off to make a homemade cloche. remember to remove this once the plant starts to outgrow it.   alternately  consider using pellets or traps.    sunflowers are hungry plants. you can really help the plant s growth by giving it a weekly feed with a liquid fertilizer. avoid using slow release or granular fertilizers as these will release nutrients too slowly to benefit the fast growing plant.   you may find that the sunflowers won t grow as well the following year because the nutrients in that area have been depleted. mix in plenty of manure at the end of the growing season to help stimulate regrowth.    you should get a good display of sunflowers by the late summer. after that  the flower heads will fade and the petals wither. if you are a generous wildlife gardener  it s beneficial to birds to leave the plants where they are so the birds can enjoy eating the seeds.   alternately you can cut the flowerheads and put them on a bird table.    sunflowers  especially giant varieties  leave a woody stalk behind. cut this stalk to about knee height with a small hand saw. then either pull it out of the ground or dig it out. you can compost the stems.    sunflowers may self seed. if you don t want volunteer  self sown  sunflowers in your garden the following year  sweep up any seeds you see.   to stop them from scattering  you may like to lay a sheet under the plants to catch any dropped seeds as you remove the flowerheads and the rest of the plant. or you can hoe the area when the young seedlings emerge to kill them off.    alan turing was a brilliant mathematician credited with being a very significant figure in the birth of modern computing and artificial intelligence. he made an enormous contribution to code breaking during world war ii and his work on breaking the code of the german naval  enigma  code machines is generally agreed to have helped shorten the conflict by several years.  to mark the centenary of turing s birth in 2012  a mass participation science project was proposed by the university of manchester  where turing studied. individuals  groups and schools were encouraged to plant sunflowers to help prove turing s theories about the presence of fibonacci numbers in sunflowers. this would also help commemorate this brilliant scientist as well as prove his work in a 2012 experiment examining 3000 sunflower heads.   turing s sunflowers aren t a special variety. for the science experiment it was proposed that taller varieties were used. these include sunflowers varieties such as russian giant  giant single and giant yellow. all these varieties grow to around 8 to 10 feet  2.4 to 3.0 m  in height.    once the sunflowers are mature  you might like to participate in the science project

query	136	visit pope pope benedict xvi address the pope  another acceptable way to address the pope in writing would be  most holy father.    note  however  that on the envelope  you should address the pope as  his holiness            with the pope s name in the blank. for instance  if writing to pope francis  the envelope would read   his holiness  pope francis.     throughout the body of the letter  your tone should be polite and gracious. you do not need to write in flowery language  but your language should be on par with how you would speak or be expected to speak inside a catholic church.   avoid swearing  slang  derogatory language  or any other forms of impolite speech. write out everything you need or want to say  but keep in mind that the pope is a busy man. instead of dragging on and spending extensive space on flattery  it would be better for all parties concerned if you kept the formalities basic and went directly into the purpose of your letter.    as a roman catholic  you should conclude the letter with a sentence along the lines of   i have the honor to profess myself with the most profound respect. your holiness  most obedient and humble servant   before signing your name.if you are not a catholic  you can change the closing to something along the lines of   with every good wish to your holiness  i am  sincerely yours   followed by your signature. something as simple as  with every best wish. sincerely yours   with a signature after it would also work for a non catholic writing to the pope. regardless of the exact wording you choose  the level of respect you demonstrate should correspond to the minimum level of respect you should have for someone in the pope s position  at the very least. someone who does not follow catholic teaching or who disagrees with the pope should still recognize his position of authority and close in a respectful manner. anyone who does follow catholic teaching should demonstrate the respect expected from one addressing the leader of his or her faith on earth.    if you plan to send your letter by traditional mail  you should write the address on the envelop as  his holiness  pope francis   apostolic palace   00120 vatican city.   note that you should separate the address onto separate lines according to the placements of the slashes   . other ways to write the same address include   his holiness  pope francis pp.   00120 via del pellegrino   citta del vaticano his holiness pope francis   apostolic palace   vatican city his holiness pope francis   vatican city state  00120   do not write  italy  on the envelop as the country. the vatican is considered its own independent nation  completely separate from italy.    if you would rather send the letter by e mail or fax  you must go through the vatican press office. the pope does not have a personal  public e mail address or fax number.   the e mail address is  av pccs.vathe fax number is   390669885373 note that neither form of contact goes directly to the pope  but correspondence you have for the pope will get to him eventually when sent through either of these means.     his holiness  and  holy father  both address the pope by his title and position in the church. you should address the pope only by these titles rather than by his name when speaking to him face to face.    the amount of applause will vary depending on the venue  but you should always stand in respect once the pope walks into the room you are in.usually  if the venue is a small room with a small to mid size crowd  the applause is quiet and polite. for large venues  however  like a stadium mass  loud applause and even cheers are appropriate.    if the pope approaches you directly  you should kneel with your right knee bent to the floor.   you do not need to make the sign of the cross  as you would do while genuflecting to the eucharist  but you should still bend at the knee. genuflection is a sign of high respect.    if you are catholic and if the pope offers you his hand  that would be an appropriate time to plant a quick yet respectful kiss on the piscatory ring  also known as the ring of the fisherman  traditionally worn by the pope.   on the other hand  if the pope offers you his hand and you are not catholic  you are not obligated to kiss the ring. you could simply shake his hand  instead. the ring of the fisherman is a symbol and mark of the office. by kissing it  you show both respect and sincere affection for the man who holds that office.    plan what to say beforehand so that you do not stumble too much over your words  and maintain a tone that is both clear and respectful the entire time.   start by introducing yourself. give your name and say something important or fitting about yourself. if you came to the vatican for a specific purpose or desired an audience with the pope for a specific purpose  you should also state that. the pope will guide the conversation  and you should let him do so. keep your answers direct and brief  and speak in a clear  loud voice so that the pope can hear you.    as soon as the pope stands to leave  you should stand  as well. wait until he leaves the room before you sit down again or pay attention to anything else.   applause is not usually necessary at the end of the audience or event  but if you are in a large crowd and the crowd begins to applaud  it is appropriate to join in if you so desire.

query	139	find hidden talent samuel beckett mix names  make a list of all the letters found in the first name  then make a separate list of all the letters found in the second name. put the lists side by side but keep them both separate and distinct from one another.   this method is a good way to mix the names of two parents when choosing a baby name  but you can technically use this method with any two names. you can even use this method when you have more than two names to mix. you can write out the letters in the order they appear within each name  or you can rearrange the letters alphabetically. the latter may help you view the letters as separate letters instead of a name.  example  consider the names  william  and  sarah.   the former name uses the letters  a  i  i  l  l  m  w.  the latter name uses the letters  a  a  h  r  s.       treat your two name lists like an unscramble puzzle or a game of boggle. pull letters from both lists to create a name. continue until you have formed as many different names as possible.you do not need to use all of the letters in both names. in fact  you will be able to create far more combinations if you only use a few letters. it may help to have a book of baby names nearby as you do this. there are many names you may not think of when doing this exercise on your own.  example  using the letters from  william  and  sarah   you could form  alisa  iris  isaiah  larisa  lars  lisa  liam  maria  mariah  miriam  wallis  wilma    you may not spot every name possible the first time you run through your two lists. it is a good idea to return to your lists multiple times to see if you can find any new names hidden inside.   consider asking other people for help  too. someone else might be able to spot a combination you hadn t noticed yet. if you struggle to form names from your lists  you can also search online for  free name mixers.  when you find a result you like  input both names into the mixer and allow the website to generate a list of possible names from those two original names.example  upon further inspection  you could also use  william  and  sarah  to form  silas  shaw  rai  mars  lia  ash    break the first name you wish to use into its separate syllables. repeat with the second name you wish to use. write out the syllable sets side by side  but make sure you know which syllable sets came from which name.   this is another method commonly used to form baby names from the names of both parents  but it can be used with any two names. it works best with names that are two or more syllables long  however.  example  consider the names  christopher  and  elizabeth.    christopher  can be separated into the syllables  chris    to   and  pher.   elizabeth  can be separated into  e    liz    a   and  beth.       grab a syllable set from the first name and a syllable set from the second name. put both sets together to form a new  unique name. repeat with the remaining syllable sets until you have formed every combination you could think of.   note that the names you come up with using this method will be unique  and most probably won t be found in any baby book. you can form combinations using one syllable set from both names  creating a new name that is two syllables long  or you can use multiple syllable sets from both names to create a longer combination.  example  using the syllables found in  christopher  and  elizabeth   some of the possible combinations you might come up with could include  chrisabeth  christobeth  eliztopher  liztopher  elizapher  lizapher  bethtopher  bethapher  eto  toapher    some of the possible names you come up with might be better than others. comb through your list  removing any combinations that don t sound right and retaining the best options for further consideration.   while most of the names you will likely come up with won t be found in any baby books  it can still be a good idea to double check and make sure. if any of the names you do create already exist  they may have a meaning you will or won t like. repeat the name aloud several times to check how it rolls off the tongue. names that sound clunky or hard to pronounce should be eliminated  as should any possible name you simply don t like. consider showing your list of possible names to other people  too. ask them to pronounce each name on the list. if other people routinely struggle with the pronunciation of one name  you may want to consider eliminating that name.  example  if people struggle over the name  toapher   for instance  you might want to strike that one off your list.    you can use any two names  but short names tend to work best for this method.   this method is most commonly used for names other than the given names of both parents. use this method once you narrow down your selection to two names. if you attempt to use more than two names  the result will usually seem unreasonably long and clunky. additionally  this method works best when you narrow it down to names from one gender. it isn t as easy to use when combining names from both genders.  example  if the child will be a girl  the father of the baby might like  sarah  and the mother of the baby might like  elizabeth.   if the child will be a boy  the father might like  samuel  and the mother might like  luke.       put both names side by side  then separate them with a hyphen. doing so should give you a new  mixed name.combine the names in both orders to see which order sounds best.  example  for  sarah  and  elizabeth   the two options would be  sarah elizabeth  and  elizabeth sarah.   for  samuel  and  luke   the two options would be  samuel luke  and  luke samuel.       if one or both names seem too long  consider using the shortened form of the name instead of the full name. after shortening the names  hyphenate them again in the same manner as before.   you can combine a shortened version of one name with the full version of the second name  or you can shorten both names  when applicable  and use both shortened versions instead.  example  for  sarah  and  elizabeth   the name  elizabeth  can be shortened to  beth   giving you the new option of  sarah beth.  in this case  you can even remove the hyphen and the  h  after  sarah   leaving you with  sarabeth.   for  samuel  and  luke   the name  samuel  can be shortened to  sam   giving you the options  sam luke  and  luke sam.

query	143	become warming vin diesel decode a vin  you ll need to find a long serial number  usually 17 digits  marked somewhere on your car or truck. it may be in one of several locations. you can read the wikihow article on how to find your vin  vehicle identification number  or look in the common locations listed below.look on the dash at the base of the windshield on the driver s side for a small plaque. look for a sticker on the driver s door. a vin may also be found in the front of the engine block  easily visible once you open the hood. on most newer vehicles  some body parts such as fenders and hoods also have the vin on them for identification and matching parts to the vehicle. open the driver side door  and look at the where the side view mirror would be located if the door were shut. older cars may have vins found elsewhere  such as on the steering column  radiator support bracket  or the left side inner wheel arch.    you can find websites that can decode the vin of most manufacturers automatically. try vin decoder.net if you re looking for detailed  quickly accessible information.   you can try to find a vin lookup on your car manufacturer s web site  but it s not guaranteed to have one. if your vehicle was manufactured before 1980  it might have a nonstandard vin. if free lookup websites don t work  try a paid service such as carfax  autocheck  or vinaudit. these should give you a little information for free  but a full vin decoding will cost money.    specialized vin websites and vin lookup services exist to see whether your vehicle was involved in an accident  fire  or other damaging situation. you cannot decode this information from a vin yourself  since the vin for a vehicle never changes. these services just take advantage of the fact that police and other organizations use the unique vin to describe a car in accident reports.   first  try the free service at the national insurance crime bureau website. if you cannot get information for free online  you may need to pay for a vehicle history report. this should be included in the vin report services described earlier  such as vinaudit s.    follow the methods below instead if you want to have fun decoding it yourself  or if your vehicle was made by an unusual manufacturer not decodable by a website. finding out where and when your car was made should be easy  while the other methods may take extra effort.   these codes are fully standardized in north america. elsewhere in the world  most major manufacturers follow the same standards  but they may use the 9th and 10th characters for different purposes. in north america  the 9th must be used as  checking code  to confirm the vin is real  and the 10th must be used to indicate the year the car was made.    you can skip straight to the next step to find which country it is made in  but this basic information is easy to check and remember.if the first character is an a  b  c  d  e  f  g  or h  the vehicle was made in africa.  j  k  l  m  n  p  or r as the first character means the vehicle was made in asia. this includes the middle east. note that a vin never begins with a zero or o due to the ease of confusing these two symbols.  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  or z indicate europe.  1  2  3  4  or 5 indicate north america  including usa  mexico  and canada.  6 or 7 indicate australia or new zealand. note that nearby nations such as indonesia or the philippines are considered part of asia for this purpose.  8 or 9 indicate south america.    many vehicles are made in a different country than the one the manufacturing company is located in. compare the first two characters of the vin to an online chart like this one  including the first  continent  code described above  and find out where a vehicle was really made.this will also tell you which company made the car.   some companies use the third digit as well to indicate manufacturer or company division. the first two digits should be enough to identify the country and company  however.    this method will always work for north american cars  and will often work for cars from other regions. note that this might be one year later than the car was actually made. a model year of 2008 means the car was probably made either in 2007 or 2008. see below for decoding instructions a 10th character which is an a  b  c  d  e  f  g  or h indicate the years 1980   1987 in alphabetical order  or the years 2010   2017. j  k  l  m  and n are reserved for model years 1988   1992  or 2018   2022. p means the model year is 1993 or 2023. r  s  and t mean 1994   1996 or 2024   2026. v  w  x  and y mean 1997   2000 or 2027   2030. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  and 9 indicate the years 2001   2009 or 2031   2039. a real vin never contains the letters i  o  or q. the year code has additional restrictions  never using the number 0 or the letters u or z. if you re not sure whether your car is new or old  check the vehicle s 7th character. if this is a number  your vehicle s model year is earlier than 2010. if the 7th character is a letter  the model year is 2010 or later  until 2039 .    for all additional information  such as the make of engine or the exact assembly plant that made the vehicle  you ll need to know the internal system that car manufacturer uses.   if you don t know the car manufacturer  you can look it up based on the second character. look up the most common manufacturer s code online. try to find a vin lookup service or the vin decoding sheets on your car manufacturer s website. failing that  use a search engine to look for  vin decoding sheet      name of company  . this may be difficult or impossible for some manufacturers. contact the company s support service if they have one and ask about vin decoding specific to their cars. ask an auto service shop if you can see their decoding charts. the workers there use the charts to direct the repairs and adjustments they make.  depending on the manufacturer  the third character of your vin is used either to narrow down the location further to a company division  or to describe the vehicle s type. most of the time  this character simply means  car  or  truck   or provides little information that the country code doesn t  for instance  made by honda canada .    these make up the  vehicle description system  or vds. according to specific company codes  they describe the vehicle s engine and transmission types  exact model  and similar information.   technically  the 9th character is also considered part of the  vds  section  but is used to confirm the vin is real  not to describe a component.    if you want to know exactly which factory was used to make your car  the 11th digit will tell you. just like everything else in this section  you ll need to find that company s system to find out more. see the beginning of this section for more details on how to accomplish that.    each manufacturer can decide how to use this space for their own purposes.most commonly  this is a single 6 digit number that tells you the vehicle s serial number.   some manufacturers never repeat serial numbers  while others start again at 000001 each year. the 10th through 17th digits are referred to as the vehicle identification section.    use a search engine to find one and enter your full vin. remember to use capital letters.   follow the instructions below if you want to calculate it yourself instead. shady used car salesmen sometimes replace vin stickers to hide a history of damage. using an online calculator can quickly confirm whether it s a lazy fake  but a smart criminal will use a real sticker from a similar model. this is where you can compare the vin in the door to the vin on the dash or on other body components to see if major components have been replaced with used parts or mismatched parts  indicating wrecks or rebuilds.    the 9th character is a  check character  mandatory in north america but commonly used elsewhere in the world as well. this character can be used in a mathematical calculation to determine whether the vin is fake  and has no other purpose.    note  the check character will always be a number or the letter x. if it is a different letter  either the vin was fake  the car was made before 1980 and uses a different standard  or the car was made outside north america and  unusually  the makers decided not to follow the check digit standard. write down the 9th character now to check at the end of the calculation  or find it again afterward.    the first step involves replacing each letter in your vin with a number that can be used in a calculation. use the following system  and keep the characters in the same order as you replace them.for instance  if your vin begins ak6  you should rewrite it as 126.   a and j become 1 b  k  and s become 2 c  l  and t become 3 d  m  and u become 4 e  n  and v become 5 f and w become 6 g  p  and x become 7 h and y become 8 r and z become 9 if there is an i  o  or a q in your vin  it is fake. real vins never use these letters  due to how easy it is to mistake them for a number. you can skip the rest of this method  as you already know the vin isn t real.    leave plenty of space between each digit as well as below the number. consider turning a sheet of paper sideways so you have the room to write it in one line.    keep the exact order listed. note that  10  is one number  and should only go below a single digit.    each digit in the top row will be multiplied by the number directly beneath it. write the results of each problem separately  do not turn them into one long number. here s an example    a  fake  vin with letters turned into numbers as described above  4 2 3 2 2 6 3 4 2 2 6 3 2 0 0 0 1 the series of numbers to multiply  8 7 6 5 4 3 2 10 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 multiply 4 x 8  the first number in each line  to get 32. multiple 2 x 7  the second number  to get 14. continue until you get the following results  32 14 18 10 8 18 6 40 0 18 48 21 12 0 0 0 2.    add every number you got from the multiplication step together to get one number.   continuing the example above  we get 32 14 18 10 8 18 6 40 0 18 48 21 12 0 0 0 2   247.    don t calculate this division problem out to the decimal point  only to the whole number. you can use a calculator  long division or work it out in your head.    note   if the remainder is  10   write down an  x  instead. using the example above  247   11   22 remainder 5. write down 5. if you re using a calculator that gives you the answers in decimals  and you re not sure how to find the remainder  use an online remainder caculator instead.    if this is the same as the remainder you wrote down  the vin is real. otherwise  the vin is probably fake. the vin is definitely fake in this case if the car it belongs to was made in north america after 1980.   note that  if the remainder is 10  the matching 9th digit of a real vin will be  x   since the manufacturer can t use a two digit number  10  as a checking number. in our example above  the fifth digit of the original vin is 2 but our remainder is 5. these numbers are not the same  so the vin must be fake.

query	148	buy a beginner drum set cincinnati buy a bongo drum  different drums are available for beginner players and for more advanced drummers.   a beginner bongo is smaller and does not weigh as much as drums made for more skilled players. a bongo for an advanced drummer is typically more expensive due to better quality heads and rims and more ornate design.    the difference between the 2 materials is the tone of the sound of the drum. when it is played  a fiberglass drum offers a bright pop  while a wooden drum sends out an earthly  hollow sound.      when deciding on a rawhide skin to purchase  hold it up to the light. look for an evenly colored skin  which indicates a skin of uniform thickness. color variations can suggest the skin is not the same thickness all the way across  which affects the sound quality of the particular skin. since weather affects rawhide heads  expect changes in tone as the weather changes  and plan on spending more time tuning the head. warmer weather tightens the head and produces a higher pitch. synthetic heads are mass produced of man made materials and provide a consistent and smooth playing surface. changes in weather do not affect synthetic heads. synthetic heads offer a convenience above rawhide heads in that they come already stretched and tucked onto a frame and are ready to mount to the drum and play.      synthetic heads are typically pre fitted. pre fitted heads are convenient to replace quickly. they are not affected by humidity  altering the tuning and sound of the head  as rawhide heads are. flat heads give you the decision power of the exact rawhide you want for your drum and the satisfaction of tucking it on your own. if you use flat heads  you will have to learn how to tuck heads  and then each time you tuck one  you will have to wait to play the bongo until the head dries.      the size of the drummer can direct you to the size of bongo you purchase. a smaller drum set better accommodating a person of smaller stature. sound preference can be instrumental in determining the size of your bongos. smaller drums offer a higher pitched sound  while the sound of drums with larger heads is deeper.

query	150	visit egypt learn about ancient egypt  egypt is a truly ancient kingdom  which history dates around 120 000 years bc  and has led a cherished life until it was conquered by the romans and was part of various empires in later years including the ottoman  french and british empires.   it is not clear when egyptian history truly started although by 5500 bc communities were settling around the nile and developing agriculture. this era is typically known as the pre dynastic period. the climate was far less arid then than it is now  with much of the land covered with savannah and grasslands. the early dynastic period started around 3050bce is typically formed by the uniting of two kingdoms  upper egypt  which paradoxically is in the south of egypt and lower egypt which is in the northern nile delta regions. this period developed the powerful institution of the pharaohs  which were critical to its stability  regional influence and survival. in 2868 bc the period known as the old kingdom started  it was within this age that greater developments started  such as a justice system  taxation system and other levels of governance as well as more advanced crop management. the practice of creating pyramids started in this era  creating what would become many  cities of the dead  which are known as necropolis. in this age were the building of the pyramids of giza and the sphinx among many others. in 2181 bc  power struggles as well as over a century of famine conditions weakened the structure of egypt and created what is known as the first intermediate period. this period lasted a relatively short time as egypt had re split into upper and lower egypt and the period ended when the two rival dynasties went to war  with the winners being upper egypt who ruled from thebes. in 2134 bc the pharaohs of the upper kingdom had reunited egypt and set to restore the countries prosperity. this era is known as the middle kingdom and an age when egypt controlled great wealth from agriculture  precious metals and led to a great revival of arts  literature and architecture. this kingdom collapsed yet again due to famine and restive migrants. 1674 bc was the start of the second intermediate period. in this age the pharaohs power was heavily reduced and was expected to pay tribute to what were seen as foreign rulers that are known as  hyksos . however they did absorb egyptian culture as a way to hold power and introduced many new inventions. the pharaoh s court was forced to remain at the old capital  where it was kept busy by an old enemy nubia  sudan   ethiopia  to the south and the hyksos to the north. by 1549bce  the pharaohs had gradually built the military and defeated both nubia and the hyksos  which lead to the new kingdom. in this age the egyptian empire was at its largest and saw a great period of arts  monument building and literature. this age built vast wealth  however as its religious institutions become too powerful  the nation fractured once again. the third intermediate period lasted for quite some time  starting from 1069 bc and was ruled by many dynasties  including many libyan princes. while the empire regained power  wealth and prestige  it also was a period with many wars that led to an eventual decline. by 672bce  the two kingdoms were reunited and this is known as the late period. in this age egypt was threatened by many different kingdoms and was eventually conquered the the greeks in 332bce  by alexander the great. the ptolemaic period was 3 centuries ruled by greek dynasties  however the hellenistic culture did not overthrow the ancient culture and the greek rulers absorbed the local culture and religion to hold power. 30 bce is marked by the famous story of cleopatra  arguably the last true independent pharaoh of egypt  but does not count as the last egyptian pharaoh which was before the invasion by greece. the stories say that cleopatra having failed to fend off a roman invasion during a roman civil war with her roman lover mark antony and committed suicide after which egypt swiftly fell to the romans.    egypt had an enormous variety of different creation myths  legends as well as gods and goddesses. this lasted until 391 when the christian emperors eroded and banned any traditional institutions. eventually  christianity gave way to islam which is the majority religion today.   in ancient egypt  the location of the nile was important. the living lived on the east of the nile  where the sun rose  and in a rite of passage the deceased were taken to the west of the nile  which were the lands of the dead. the tradition of placing pennies in the coffin or on the corpse to pay for the ferryman comes from ancient egypt. deities were not always seen as benevolent and the faithful prayed to them for protection against their wrath. this pattern also created many of the animal gods such as the hippopotamus   a most dangerous creature   as well as other predators. the overall system was complex  and the priests typically made little effort to unify the religion and resolve conflicting myths. this in many ways did not seem to pose a major problem as it would today. egypt was also the place where the worlds first recorded monotheistic religion started long before the current religions of today. this was a short lived period ruled by akhenaten  who worshiped a sun god known as aten. after this king died  his successor  tutankhaten  revived the old ways and changed his name to tutankhamun  cementing his power by invoking the old sun god amun. the later transfer from the old religions to christianity was not a smooth transition  with the mathematician and philosopher hypatia later murdered outside a large church during a time of political rivalry as a scapegoat. this event is sometimes marked as the end of the classical civilization. the pharaohs and the nobles were mummified as a way to ensure their pathway to eternal paradise was safe. to help preserve the body  parts were extracted  including the brain through the nose  and stored in canopic jars. they often took furniture  gold  food and slaves  in early days slaves were entombed alive with the pharaoh  but later sculptural images were made to represent them   as things to enjoy in the next world. egyptian temples were slightly different to greek and roman temples. the god occupied a small sanctum or chamber and the priests dealt directly with the god   the common person usually didn t even get close but used the priest as an intermediary. on very special occasions the image of the god was taken out into the public space for worship. gods served as an important role not only in life  but in death. a person who traveled to the underworld had their heart weighed on a pair of scales against the feather of truth  while they were interrogated by the gods about their life. should their heart be heavy  also if they lie   their heart would be fed to a demon monster and that person would then be damned. visit design and make a canopic jar  embalm   make a mummy for more insights about the methods they used     egypt was quite advanced in its time in medicine. the stone ground flour was gritty and wore down egyptians teeth  the close proximity to the nile bought parasites  malaria and other diseases and a lot of work related injuries. many mummies reveal the wealthy were often overweight from a rich diet. adult life expectancy for egyptians was around 35 and with infant mortality high with 1 3 of infants dying  the egyptians lived fast and died young  and death was a central facet of their philosophy.   egyptian doctors were highly specialized so that there were doctors for specific ailments. egyptians at quite an early age used bandages  set bones  stitched wounds  performed dentistry  amputated limbs  had an understanding of anatomy and even created prosthetic. in medicine  they used honey as an antiseptic  herbal medicines and opium for pain management  many of these are still used today in processed forms   but not all medicines actually worked  some of them have been shown to have no curative properties  relied on sorcery and some even contained animal dung  egyptians were early and very skilled in glass making  creating their own type of glass known as faience. they made many household and decorative objects as well as tiles out of glass. they were also expert shipbuilders  mastering the art as early as 3000 bc  as their location on the nile river as well as access to the mediterranean sea made ships a highly useful tool to trade and transport wares. the ancient egyptians were expert mathematicians and engineers  which was an important skill not only around the nation but for building the great monuments egypt is famous for. while it is still open to debate how the egyptians created vast palaces  temples  pillars  obelisks  pyramids and other structures  it is certain the egyptians were skilled at the architectural sciences. other important early development are paper from papyrus  art and painting  precision tools  mining  irrigation  astronomy  metal smelting  ceramics  pigment making and masonry. visit make papyrus  build a karel drbal pyramid  read egyptian hieroglyphics   multiply like the ancient egyptians for more insight into their language  science and mathematics.    egypt had as principal the pharaoh who enacted most laws. while egypt does not seem to have had a fixed legal code like the modern world  or one that has survived   most cases were resolved by arbitration between local elders in a common sense methodology  preferring mediation or an agreement between the two.   severe crimes tended to be referred to the pharaoh   the vizier to judge. the system was complex for these cases as the judge was also the prosecutor and the plaintiff and defendant in the case had to defend their own cases. punishments were often severe and extended to the family of the criminal. egyptian society was very class conscious and unlike the greeks had little fluidity between the hierarchical classes. after the pharaoh came the scribes  officials and then the priests  doctors  engineers and other scholars  below them came the craftsmen and workers  below them were the farm workers and at the bottom of the ladder were the slave populations. however  ancient egypt like greece did have an equal system for men and women where they were equal under the law and all classes except the slaves could petition to have their case heard and resolved. egyptian women were more free than their descendants in the modern religions. both men and women could also marry  own property  sell and trade  inherit and make contracts equally  which was unlike many of egypt s neighbors the downside is that they tended to have less access to education if their family did not persist in it  did not always occupy high positions in administration and that while many women ruled as pharaoh  they often wore a symbolic and prosthetic beard to represent masculine strength. the military defended the nation and was typically recruited from the populace but in later years  which caused much strife  relied on mercenaries and foreign troops. egypt however had a very centralized and well managed economy  in which the temples played in a key role as many granaries and good pasture was in the temple property. all products bought and wages paid were on a fixed rate  so inflation was heavily controlled. workers were paid in a fixed rate of grain of which they could barter with and administrators were paid in grain and silver or copper. enforced recruitment was known during times of pyramid and monument building  which seeing the short life expectancy was quite often   as well as times of civil war which was also fairly common.    egypt was a world spice center and an important part of the world as the fertile valley around the nile had regular flood and dry periods which allowed new silt rich to improve the soil. this gave egypt regular crop surpluses in good years  but like today  the nile is still the life source of egypt. like many other cultures  the ancient egyptians relied a lot of beer as a beverage as the nile water was unsafe to drink. this beer was often thick  cloudy and nutritious almost to being a watery porridge or gruel. wine was imported or made locally  but beer was the beverage for the common people. vegetables could be grown almost year round and included a lot of onions and garlic  lettuce  pulses and beans   especially lentils and chickpeas  as well as varieties of cucumber  gourd and water plant tubers. fruits included melons  dates  nuts  figs  grapes and pomegranates. coconuts were imported from the tropics at great expense and by the roman period  they had a range of stone fruits such as apple  pear  plums and quince as well as almonds  walnuts and pistachios. the ancient egyptian diet was low in sugar  but the egyptians did like their sweet dishes which were frequently made of honey  sweet carob pods  dates and figs. in the early dynasties when the nile valley was lush and green  meat was a common staple  which included antelope  birds such as duck  geese and quail  as well as ostrich  crocodile and even hippo and porcupine  they also farmed cows  goats  sheep and pigs for consumption and fished often  but fish was more a commoner s diet  where further north in rome   greece  fish was incredibly expensive. other staples include breads  cheese and eggs  but for the poorer people bread  beer and legumes or pulses tended to be the main foundations.    the egyptian home varied according to the wealth of the inhabitant  basic homes were typically mud brick houses  often with white painted walls  reed mat carpets  decorative fabric wall hangings and a semi detached kitchen  which was usually made without a roof to be able to let the heat and smoke of the fires out of the house.   the egyptian bed was usually a solid wooden frame bed  with a reed mat if any for padding  the beds often doubled up as seating during the day. there was no pillow  but a headrest made from wood or metal as the only additional comfort. the egyptians enjoyed theater although as the climate is excessively hot  it was never as big as the greeks and romans who built vast amphitheater and circus arenas. however the abydos passion play is still likely to be the world s oldest existent play. clothing in ancient egypt was very egalitarian  both men and women wore a large folded piece of bleached white linen  while children wore no clothes until they were 12 after which they were given clothing and had their heads shaved. popular past times includes board games such as senet  mehen  unfortunately the rules have long been lost so it is unknown how to play this game  and hounds and jackals. for the youth  ball games  wrestling and games such as marbles made from old knuckle bones were popular. egyptian games didn t have dice  so used a series or color coded sticks or bones to create values. the wealthy classes often enjoyed hunting and fishing  but the poorer classes were typically tied to their farms and so had little time for leisure during the day. hygiene was very important  which in a hot climate is an important consideration as well as for religion. men and women bathed often if not daily and used a soap made from oils and sand or fat and crushed chalk. men often shaved their entire bodies and both genders used scented ointments as a perfume. women often used a mirror made of polished bronze and both genders used kohl  which is an eye makeup with medicinal as well as sun protective qualities. the egyptians loved music and parties  although they were expensive. common instruments included a wide range such as drums  cymbals  bells  flutes  trumpets  pipe instruments  lyres and harps. egyptian palaces were much grander affairs  often featuring great painted murals  polished stone and fine furnishings   often expensive wood such as cedar imported from elsewhere  to be able to express the great wealth of egypt. visit play senet for an idea about the worlds oldest board game     you can learn from online sources  documentaries  visiting museums as well as from history experts to gain an insight into an empire  culture and its people whose effects can still be felt today within the modern world.

query	156	go on a trek himalayas go trekking in the himalayas  you can register with the region s local licensed tour company to make your travel easier. the climate and geography is complex  so when considering your trip you need to plan carefully where to go  when to go and what your budget is.    in the east  the himalaya originates from a knot between myanmar  tibet  now under china  and india. the chain continues to the border of bhutan. beyond that lies sikkim  home to many peaks including the world s third highest  kangchenjunga. the himalayan range west of sikkim forms part of nepal until you reach the border of kumaun and garhwal. from here the indian himalayan chain continues without a break through kinnaur  spiti  ladakh and lastly east karakoram range. knowing the region may help you choose the suitable area for the trekking depending on the type of trekking terrains you want to choose.    consider some short hikes nearby home to develop basic fitness  start by walking slow in the beginning and gradually increasing your pace. consider carrying a backpack  camping for days together  walking on rough trails  the different food. this will help you to select the trek best suited to you. walking alone or with few friends can be wonderful  though it is easier for the young as you need to put more than walking into your day. if you plan to camp out and cook  develop stamina. if you plan to stay in local homes or tea houses  than you must know the language a little  learn the basics like greeting and common phrases used by locals.    a trek is enjoyed more if you are not particularly tired on reaching the camp after a day s march. even if you are only moderately conditioned at the outset  it will not take more than 2 to 3 days to become almost fully conditioned after a week you will either be perfectly tuned or completely fed up  depending upon your mental and physical responses. enjoy your walk keeping in tune with the demands of the land.    the experience is likely to be a cultural surprise cum shock which you must learn to absorb. you need to adjust  at least temporarily  to the ways and responses of the people and sights encountered wherever you happen to travel. only those read few books about the himalayas will not acquaint you with the region from authentic sources. most europeans who have never visited india and nepal before have wrong ideas and notions about the country. the initial experience   the heat  the noise and the street life  the vibrant colors and the multitudes of people   may bewilder and exhaust the first   time visitor  but the country and its people are friendly and hospitable. once you have spent some time here everything will fall into place  and you will be amply rewarded with your first glimpse of the himalayan peaks  one of the most spectacular mountain ranges in the world.          physical conditioning of the cardiovascular system with aerobic exercise. background reading  maps etc. wear warm clothes as climate in such higher altitude areas remain very cold throughout the year. camping and cooking equipment  this depends on the style of trekking  but if you are totally equipping yourself then you could consider the following  sturdy rain proof tent. sleeping bag with liner and foam mattress. backpack  day pack and probably a duffel bag to keep in storage in hotels while on trek. a kerosene stove that can be cleaned easily  a leak proof fuel container  lightweight pots  pans and cutlery. favorite food items.    good food is essential part of the trekking and here good food does not refer to costly delicacies but wholesome and nutritious diet. choice of food is limited once you leave the town and head for wilderness. in many villages there are no food outlets and the trekkers have to be on their own for food. one should drink boiled water or tea mostly to avoid dehydration. however freshly cooked food has no substitute as tinned food losses its taste after some time. trekkers should carry dry fruits  chocolates  sweets  soup packets  coffee powder  a biscuit  butter cheese  noodles etc.    as the himalayan rescue association likes to point out   the himalaya starts where other mountains leave off.  remember it is the sleeping altitude that is critical. if you ascend to an area of high altitude  you are likely to experience some form of altitude sickness. usually  the symptoms are mild and will improve if you descend. what counts as high altitude   high altitude refers to heights that are between 1 500 and 3 500m above sea level. very high altitude is from 3 500 to 5 500m above sea level. extreme altitude is from 5 500 to 7 500m above sea level. the way to prevent altitude sickness is to give the body enough time to get used to the rarefied air. a slow and steady ascent is vital. adequate hydration is also helpful. the body is constantly losing fluid from the lungs and the skin in the high  dry environment. drink enough to maintain a clear and abundant urine output. other measures include eating a high carbohydrate diet  climbing high during the day and coming lower down to sleep  and to mild to moderate activity during the rather than just lie around. almost all altitude problems can be avoided if symptoms are recognized and acted upon. the warning signs are headache  lack of appetite  nausea  feeling of tiredness  and sometimes vomiting. this stage of mild mountain sickness can be treated with aspirin or diamox for headache and something mild for the nausea and vomiting.    always ask your doctor for advice and read the patient information that comes with your medicine.

query	158	locate kansas city win a barbecue cook off  to qualify for winning the cook off  you must follow and adhere to all the contest rules. for example  if the rules prohibit you from using lighter fluid on the coals within your grill  start the grill using newspaper and matches instead.   obtain a copy of the rules by consulting with the panel of judges for the cook off or by visiting the website for the cook off.    this practice may help you determine the flavors of and cooking methods for preparation of your meat. for example  if you are participating in a cook off in the city of memphis  but your judges are from kansas city  they may prefer sweeter kansas city style flavors as opposed to memphis style flavors rich in vinegar.   read the short summaries or biographies about the panel of judges in your cook off rules  brochure  or from the cook off website. introduce yourself to the judges far in advance before the cook off  if possible  to determine the background and experience of each judge.    engaging in forums and discussions about barbecue may give you new  additional tips and ideas for unique and flavorful barbecue dishes.   perform an internet search using keywords such as  barbecue forums  or  barbecue discussions  to locate online barbecue communities.    depending on the competition rules  you may be required to purchase a fire extinguisher or sanitation supplies for your booth at the cook off.    high quality meat is considered to be fresh and either all natural or organic  and in most cases may taste better than pre packaged meat found in many grocery stores.   consult with farmers in your local area or region who can provide you with fresh meat  or order high quality meat from farmers in other regions. visit grocers who specialize in all natural or organic products to purchase your meat for the barbecue.    barbecue cook offs often judge participants on their ability to produce a new  unique barbecue flavor.   try combinations of different sauces  dry spices  and cooking methods to develop a unique flavor based on the rules of your cook off. for example  if the cook off allows you to use either cherry wood or hickory wood in your grill  experiment using both types of wood to determine which produces the better flavor.    most cook off judges prefer barbecue dishes in which the sauce does not retain a watery or runny consistency.   create a glaze that sticks to the meat without dripping or add small amounts of honey  or dehydrated honey  to your flavor in order to decrease your chances of a mess.    judges will rank your food according to how appetizing the dish appears  and may also inspect the area in which you are preparing your barbecue for cleanliness.   use paper towels to wipe up sauce spills from counters and sauce streaks from the edges and sides of boxes or containers. if you place toothpicks in your meat  use neutral  wood colors instead of colored toothpicks. the dye on colored toothpicks may transfer onto the meat when the toothpick is pulled out.    warm or hot barbecue may taste better to the judges and give the impression that the food is fresh  whereas cold food may give the impression that the prepared food is less fresh.   cook the meat shortly before the judges  taste test or use a chafing dish to keep the barbecue warm after cooking.  
query	159	get into a bar in kelowna kelowna make liquid soap  you can make liquid soap from any bar of soap you have around the house. use whatever leftover or half used bars you have  or put some extra thought into your choice to create a liquid soap you can use for a specific purpose.for example    use a bar of facial soap to make a liquid soap you can use on your face. use a bar of antibacterial soap to make a good cleansing hand soap to use in your kitchen or bathroom. use a bar of moisturizing soap to make a liquid soap you can use as body wash. use unscented soap if you want to add your own scent to create customized liquid soap.    use a fine cheese grater to grate the entire bar of soap into a bowl. use the finest grater you have so that when it s time for the soap to melt  the process goes more quickly. you can cut the soap into chunks if that helps you grate it more easily.   you should end up with about 1 cup  229 g  of soap flakes. if you have less  grate a second bar of soap. this recipe can easily be doubled or tripled if you want to make a lot of liquid soap. it makes a great gift  especially when it s stored in pretty jars.    boil 1 cup  235 ml  of water  then pour into a blender along with the grated soap. whip the water and soap until it takes on the consistency of paste.   making soap in your blender may leave a residue that s hard to clean out  so if you d prefer not to use it  you can make your soap on the stove instead. simply add the soap flakes to the water once it has started to boil on your stove. try making soap in the microwave as another alternative. place a cup of water in a microwave safe dish  bring it to a boil in the microwave  add the flakes  and let them sit for a few minutes to melt. place the dish back in the microwave and heat it up in 30 second increments if it needs more heat.    glycerin acts as a moisturizer for the skin  making liquid soap a little gentler on your body than regular bar soap. mix in 1 tsp.  5 g  glycerin  stirring until it is thoroughly combined.    here s where you can get creative with your liquid soap  especially if you started with an unscented bar. consider adding the following ingredients if you want to make your liquid soap special    mix in honey or lotion to add moisture. stir in a few drops of essential oil to scent the soap. add 10 to 20 drops each of tea tree and lavender essential oils to make your soap naturally antibacterial. use some natural food coloring to change the color. avoid using standard chemical based coloring  since it s not good for your skin to absorb.    continue to whip the mixture in the blender once it has thoroughly cooled. gradually pour water into the mixture as it whips until your soap is an ideal consistency. if you re not using a blender  just stir in the water and whisk it vigorously.  once it has completely cooled  you can pour it into jars or pump containers using a funnel. if you have a large amount of soap  put whatever doesn t fit in your containers into a large bottle or jug. keep the remaining soap on hand to use when refilling your smaller bottles.    in order to get liquid soap to transform and form bubbles  you need the right mix of oils and a chemical called potassium hydroxide  also known as lye. this recipe yields six quarts of soap.you can get these ingredients at health stores  craft stores or online    11 oz. potassium hydroxide flakes 33 oz. distilled water 24 oz. coconut oil 10 oz. olive oil 10 oz. castor oil 3 oz. jojoba oil    when you work with lye  you need to wear safety gear and set up your work area properly. plan to work in a well ventilated room with good lighting so you can see what you re doing. you ll need the following supplies    a crock pot plastic or glass measuring bowls kitchen scale stick blender gloves and protective goggles    weigh the oils and place them in the crock pot on low heat. make sure you add the exact amount specified for each oil  adding more or less will throw off the recipe.    put on your protective gear and make sure the window is open. weigh the distilled water in a large bowl. weigh the lye in a separate bowl  then add it to the water. stir it constantly as you pour it in.make sure you add the lye to the water  and not the other way around  adding water to lye causes a dangerous reaction.    pour the solution into the crockpot slowly  making sure none splashes back onto your skin. use the stick blender to blend the lye with the oils to make sure they get thoroughly combined.   as you blend the liquids  the mixture will begin to thicken. continue stirring until it reaches trace  which happens when the mixture gets thick enough that you can run a spoon through it and see the line in its wake. the mixture will continue to thicken into a paste.  continue cooking the mixture on low for about six hours  checking it every 30 minutes to break it up with a spoon. the paste is finished cooking when you can dissolve one ounce of paste in two ounces of boiling water and it comes out clear  rather than milky. if your test comes out milky  keep cooking.    you should have about a pound of paste after it s finished cooking  weight it just to make sure  then put it back in the crock pot. add 33 oz. of distilled water to the paste to dilute it. it may take a few hours for the paste to get completely dissolved into the water.    use your favorite essential oil and a natural food coloring to add a special scent and color to your soap once it has been diluted.    pour the soap into jars you can seal  since you ll have a lot more than you can use at one time. pour the soap you want to use into a soap bottle with a pump dispenser.

query	161	reach lake lake of the ozarks catch lake trout  this is the best rod to use for trout fishing and allows you to use a variety of techniques to catch your trout. the lighter line has less friction with the water  allowing you cast your line to the very bottom of the lake with ease.          some lake trout can be over 35 pounds  you will need a heavier rod for these. if you know you re fishing a lake that has massive fish  bring a heavier rod as well. use an open faced spinning reel with a thin line. be sure to put the reel on the rod facing the correct direction. use either number 6 or 10 hooks.    since lake trout feed on a number of different native species  the best lure is the one that most closely mimics their individual food preferences. if you re not sure which lure is best  ask around at the local bait and tackle shop. local anglers will be able to tell you what to use to catch lake trout in your area.small weightless lures and spinners typically make the best artificial bait. add shiny metal foil or beads to further attract the trout.    if you prefer to use live bait  these three options are usually the best bet. again  ask at your local tackle shop to find out what the fish in your area are biting on lately. fish have different preferences depending on the season and region.    since catching lake trout is so dependent on finding out at what depth they re located  investing in a depth finder can make or break your day s success. lake trout prefer to be in approximately 53 degree water. their depth and eating habits will change with the weather.   in the early spring and fall lake trout swim at a depth of between 35 and 45 feet  10.7 to 13.7m . later in the spring and in the summer they move deeper to 50 to 65 feet  15.4 to 19.8m . in cold weather  when the lake is iced over  trout are found closer to the surface  at a depth of about 10 feet  3 m .    this technique is best in areas where fish are concentrated  so you might want to try it if you re fishing a well stocked lake. use a spoon jig or a white buck tail jig  and bait with a minnow or a piece of sucker meat. drop your line near the bottom of the lake and slowly work your way up  jiggling the line to so that your jig resembles a wounded baitfish and attracts your trout.          this technique does not require any special rod or reel. be sure the jig you use is light  just 1 2 ounce to 3 4 ounce. this technique works best from a boat  rather than the shore.    trolling is the better technique to use when fish aren t concentrated into schools  but scattered in different places around the lake. you  troll  for fish by moving around to find them. be sure to use your depth finder  and you might want to use a fish finder  too. you can troll for fish from a boat or on shore  as long as you ll be able to cast your line deep enough. to troll for fish  do the following    use a spinning reel or bait caster and any type of rod with the properly weighted line. attach a weight so that you can cast to the proper depth and drag the hook along without it rising to the surface. the weight is determined by your speed and the season. use a light lure or a spoon  or use a live minnow that s hooked through the lips. drive your boat to the middle of the lake and use your depth finder and fish finder to find a good starting spot. start trolling at a slow speed once you have reached the desired depth. the key is to go very slow.    you will have to feel and watch the line to know when you have a bite. small trout will furiously swim away  causing the line to vibrate quickly. jerk the rod up 1 to 2 feet  31 to 61cm  to further hook the trout once it has bitten.          reel the trout in slowly  keeping the rod above your head. remove the trout from the hook and either place in a cooler or return back to the water.    the largest concentration of lake trout is found in ontario  canada  where 25 percent of the world s lake trout population lives. lake trout are commonly found in lakes stretching as far south as kentucky. they have also been introduced to lakes in europe  asia and south america.   lake trout are so popular among anglers that their natural population has been overfished. lake trout are commonly stocked in lakes to meet the demand of anglers.since lake trout like cold water  they re less commonly found in warmer regions like the southern us.    lake trout like to spend time where it s colder. you re more likely to find a good supply of lake trout in a deep  cold lake than in a shallow  warmer lake. check around your region to find out the best places to go trout fishing  or ask local anglers where the deepest spots of your local lake are.    trout fishing can be done during any season. it s important to know where they like to spend time in different types of weather. during the summer  trout can be found in the deepest  coldest parts of the lake. after the lake ices over  they re found closer to the top  since the shallower waters are cool enough for them.   once you find a good spot for trout fishing during a certain season  return to it the next year during the same season and you re likely to find a good trout supply there again. if there s one time of year when trout are most difficult to catch  it s probably the middle of summer  when the lake is warmest and the trout are in its darkest depths. it s more difficult to figure out where the trout are hanging out and reach them with your line.  trout are often found near natural dropoffs and ledges  since the water near these features tends to be deeper and cooler. if you re fishing from the shore  it s especially helpful to set up near a dropoff rather than casting your line from a place where the grade is more gradual.    trout feed on smaller fish as well as plankton  and you can often find them under a school of smaller fish. they hang out underneath to wait for a weaker fish to get close enough to eat. these smaller fish feed on underwater vegetation. if you re fishing from a boat  set up near an area with plenty of vegetation to see if trout might be hiding under the smaller schools of fish.   knowing the specific feeding habits of the smaller baitfish in your region can be very helpful. talk to an experienced angler at a bait and tackle shop to find out more about the eating habits of local lake trout.

query	165	see local laws and customs north korea deal with being framed in a foreign country  if you are stopped or arrested while traveling in a foreign country the first thing you should do is contact your embassy. if you are traveling in a foreign country that has ongoing diplomatic ties with your home country  there should be one or more embassies in the country where you are traveling. the embassy is usually in the capital city. in some cases  there may be embassies in other large cities around the country as well.in france  for example  the u.s. has embassy offices in paris  marseilles  bordeaux  lyon  rennes  strasbourg and toulouse. it would be smart  when traveling to a foreign country  to research ahead of time where the nearest embassy will be. take along the address and telephone number for contacting the embassy  just in case of emergency. the embassy is the diplomatic office of your country s ambassador to that foreign country. embassy officials work to form diplomatic ties between the two countries  to assist travelers  and to provide aid in times of emergency.    the officials at the embassy should be able to provide you with a list of local attorneys who are willing to help travelers.be sure to inform the embassy officials about the charge against you  as much as you understand it. ask about referrals to attorneys who practice that sort of law  and who speak your native language.   you should ask your contact at the embassy to help you in reaching a local attorney  and for advice about the local legal system. embassy staff are generally trained in the customs and laws of the local country. ask your embassy connection to help identify the kind of legal practitioner you need. different countries use different terms  like  attorney    lawyer    barrister    solicitor   or  notary.  find out what qualifications you need in a lawyer for your situation.    when you have received referrals to one or more attorneys  you will want to talk with them to make your selection. you need to ask the attorney about his or her qualifications  and make sure that he or she can provide the kind of representation that you need. try to find someone with experience dealing with the kind of charges that have been issued against you.in making your decision  make sure that the attorney you choose is someone with whom you can communicate and is someone you can understand. be sure you understand the payment expectations. you need to discuss with any potential attorney the fee for his or her services. make sure that you understand when payment is due and the form of payment that is required. finally  make sure that you and your attorney have the same understanding about the amount of work that will be covered by the payment.  in addition to negotiating and handling your case  you will need your attorney to help you understand the legal system in a country that is unfamiliar to you.   figure out the charges against you. if you did not already understand the charge against you from the arresting officers  work with your attorney to find out. try to understand exactly what you are alleged to have done  and when and where the event allegedly occurred. ask your attorney about the legal system in the country you are in. in many countries  for example  a defendant is considered to be innocent until the government  police and prosecutor  can prove guilt in court. but in many others  there is a presumption of guilt  which the defendant must rebut.work with your attorney to understand the possible penalties. if  for example  you are charged with something that only has the possibility of a monetary fine  it may be advantageous just to pay the fine and put the matter behind you  even if you did not commit the crime. that could save you from extended legal fees and the possibility of being held in a foreign country against your will.    help your attorney review any evidence against you. even though you may claim that you have been framed  the local police must have some evidence to support their arrest. work with your attorney to review that evidence. tell your attorney everything about your travels  so that he or she can try to establish an alibi for you.prepare for trial with your local attorney. trial systems are different from one country to another. you will need to rely on your local attorney and his or her advice regarding trial preparation. assist as much as possible with developing a case strategy  an alibi  and any other defenses that you can.    do your best to appear professional and respectful. you may claim that you have been  framed  by the charges against you  but you must treat the system as respectfully as you can. work with your attorney and the local officials to present the best case that you can. your case may have a jury or may be tried directly to a judge  depending on the legal system in that country.if you do not yet already know  you should learn how to speak and understand some phrases in the native language for courtroom etiquette. practice such phrases as  yes  your honor    no  your honor   or whatever the judge is called. have your attorney prepare you in the customs of the courtroom  when you will stand  sit  respond  and so on.    depending on the country where you are traveling  and your reason for being there  you may explore whether some form of immunity might apply to you. talk with officials at the embassy and with your local attorney about this idea. if you can argue that immunity should apply  then you may be released right away.immunity is a complicated topic  with a range of different levels of coverage. in short  it means that national diplomats  their staff  and their families cannot be prosecuted for crimes in a foreign country. higher level diplomats and staff members have higher levels of immunity. if you believe you may be covered  you should notify local law enforcement officials of your position  and talk with the embassy staff to help make your case.  as an alternative to proceeding with the criminal trial process  your attorney and your embassy might work together to make a deal to have you leave the country. this could be either as an extradition or deportation.   being extradited generally means that you will go back to your home country and potentially face the same criminal charges there. you will still have to prove your innocence  but at least you could do it in your own country.alternatively  you might suggest deportation.the country with the charge against you may consider this a victory because it gets rid of you.    you could have your attorney  your embassy  and even people back at home make a plea for your release and return on human rights grounds. this will depend on the charge against you  the level of evidence  and the potential punishment. the more severe the punishment  the more relevant a human rights plea might be.a noted example is the case of otto warmbier  a student from the university of virginia  who was tried and convicted in north korea for the crime of  subversion   when he took down a propaganda poster. he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. immediately following the sentence  american diplomats and the organization human rights watch condemned the sentence and tried to have warmbier released.

query	179	cook beetroot prepare beetroot  choose small to medium sized beets for a better flavor. next  examine the beet roots for freshness. the leaves should be perky and green and the skin should be smooth and unbroken.if you re going to cook the beets  choose beets that are similar in size. otherwise  they will cook at different rates. if the beetroot skin is wrinkled  the beetroot is too old.    leave about 3cm of stem attached to the root. if you cut the entire stem off  the root will bleed as it cooks.don t throw away the leaves  they can be chopped up and added to a stew or salad.   store the leaves in the refrigerator for up to two days.    gently rinse the root under warm water. make sure you remove all traces of dirt and debris  especially if you re serving the root raw. if you re planning on cooking the beetroots  be careful not to tear the skins or the beetroot will bleed as you cook it.  if you don t plan on cooking or pickling the beetroots immediately  store them in the refrigerator before cooking them. first  lay a plastic re sealable bag on your cutting board. next  use a knife to score the bag two or three times. place your trimmed and cleaned beetroot in the bag and store it in the refrigerator.trimmed and cleaned beetroots will stay fresh for about a week in the refrigerator. to help them stay fresh keep them in the  crisper  drawer. uncleaned beetroots can be stored in a dark place for three days or in the refrigerator for ten days.  use a vegetable peeler to peel the skin off the beetroot. stand over the sink as you work to allow the peeled pieces to fall into an easy to clean spot. be careful where you lay your beetroot as raw beetroot can stain virtually any surface.if you don t want the roots to stain your hands  wear gloves while you handle them.    first  thinly slice the beetroot  discarding the top section attached to the stem and the pointy tip. next  toss the beetroot slices with the juice of one lemon and a teaspoon of chile powder. arrange the beetroot on a plate and garnish with extra chile powder.experiment with different spice blends to find one you love. for example  consider substituting cayenne pepper for chile powder.    for example  shredded beetroots can be added to any coleslaw recipe to improve the nutrition and flavor. after peeling the skin  use a cheese grater or vegetable shredder to grate the root into a plastic bowl. prepare your favorite coleslaw recipe  either adding shredded beetroot or replacing the cabbage completely.   if the recipe you prefer uses a lot of sugar  wait to add the sugar until the beetroots are fully incorporated. then  add sugar to taste. shredded beetroot can also be added on top of any salad or into a dip.    choose a heavy duty baking foil. first  measure out a square of foil and crinkle it slightly. next  wrap each cleaned and trimmed beet in a loose layer of aluminum foil. make sure every part of the beetroot is covered.    preheat your oven to 375  f  190  c . place the wrapped beets directly on the oven rack and cook them for about an hour. let the beets cool before handling them.test for doneness by piercing the tip with a paring knife. the knife should pierce the skin easily.    first  make sure the beets have cooled. next  dampen a clean dishcloth. use this dishcloth to rub away the skin of the beet.after the beetroot is peeled  cut off and discard the top section attached to the stem and the long pointed tip.   the skin of the beetroot should slip off easily when cooked. if not  cook the beetroot for another ten minutes. remember to wear gloves while working with beets.    once the beets have been roasted and peeled  chop the beets into bite sized pieces and place in a serving bowl. drizzle in some olive oil and toss the beets with salt and pepper. now you can add nuts  sliced vegetables  pieces of citrus fruit  or soft cheese. wear gloves while peeling the beetroots to avoid staining your fingers. serve as a delicious winter salad.   baked beets  hazelnuts  blood orange  and goat cheese are a popular beet salad combination. if you prefer savory combinations  try adding feta cheese and sliced red onions to baked beetroots.    if you have small  uniform beetroots  you can steam them whole. if you have larger beetroots  cut the roots into quarters before you steam them. next  cut off the top part of the beetroot attached to the stem and the pointed tip at the end. discard these pieces.   don t peel the beetroots before cutting them as the skin will help hold in nutrients and color.    place a metal stovetop steamer basket on your stove over medium high heat. pour about two inches of water into the steamer reservoir and bring the water to a boil.   read the manufacturer instructions before using a stovetop basket steamer. some steamers have specific limitations on heat and water levels. stovetop basket steamers can be bought at most grocery stores and baking supply stores.    add the beets to the basket. cover the basket with the lid and steam the beets for about 45 minutes. check the water level periodically and add more if needed. check for doneness by spearing the beetroot with a fork. the fork should slide into the root easily.   steaming beetroots is faster than baking beetroots. however  steaming is less healthy as nutrients are lost to the water.  use a damp  clean dishtowel to rub the beetroot skin off the beetroot sections.rinse the beetroot sections under cold water and place in a bowl. next  drizzle the beetroot with olive oil and toss it with salt and pepper. these beetroot sections can be served as a side dish or added to a salad.  
query	180	produce boric acid get rid of roaches with borax  roaches are omnivorous and seek dark  moist places . inspect areas around the baseboards of your floor  under or around pipes  anywhere there is food waste  behind electrical outlet covers  and narrow  hard to reach spaces are ripe for potential infestation. roaches prefer to leave their eggs protected in dark crevices if they are not viviparous or oviparous.    you can do this by blowing a portable fan around the area to provoke an escape response  or by using an intense sudden light source to provoke the escape response . leaving bait out without any pesticide is not recommended  as it will simply encourage infestation.    these are areas with regular food contact  exposure to water  or that are dark and inaccessible. these areas should be targeted regardless of observed infestation. boric acid has a strong prophylactic effect that kills generations of insects over time.    cockroaches have a number of scent glands used in communication and courtship that produce a distinctive smell  in some cases sweet  in others oily and musky. these are telltale signs of an area that is infested and should be targeted.some cockroaches are perching insects that can thrive on top of high surfaces like shelves  and these should be inventoried and cleared for application of the insecticide.    make sure this is done before preparing or applying the insecticide. clean surfaces and preventing standing water from building up deprive cockroaches of resources. bait is unnecessary with this insecticide  and eggs are less likely to be spread where there is no feeding resource for the female insect.    boric acid is a more effective insecticide  more soluble in water  and is equally unlikely to produce any lasting harm in humans. both can be applied as a powder and have identical methods of killing the insect.   boric acid will appear as large white crystals in suspension. boric acid can be bought as well  and is less hazardous than hydrochloric acid  which is required to convert borax into the far more effective insecticide  boric acid.   hydrochloric acid is sold commonly as muriatic acid as a solution to acidify swimming pools. hydrochloric acid should be handled with extreme caution. use gloves  eye protection  and respiratory protection  in a well ventilated area  and can cause significant harm. have baking soda on hand to neutralize any strong acid reaction that is unintended. do not use water to treat strong acid burns.  treat any excess solution with baking soda to neutralize the strong acid. do not pour the solution down the sink until you are sure it is neutralized. use litmus paper to test the acidity of the excess solution. when the crystals are dry they are ready for storage.    make sure it is clean  inert  clearly labelled container and free of moisture. proper storage and labeling is key to maintaining safety and avoiding accidentally ingesting the product  as it is visually quite similar to table salt. avoiding moisture will prevent unwanted large chunks from forming.   a recycled ketchup bottle can be used as a kind of bellows to distribute the insecticide powder in the tight space of an electrical outlet with minimal risk. squeeze the bottle to test and make sure dust comes out  take care to not get any in your eyes  mouth or nose . make sure the hole of the bottle you re using is large enough for the borax crystals to go through freely. borax is soluble in hot water  as is boric acid and can be dissolved and put in a spray bottle  and the dried residue of aqueous boric acid is essentially undetectable to the insect and low risk to humans. however  if you are applying it near electrical outlets use it as a powder.    it is unnecessary to mix it with bait  as it is not repellant to insects normally  and is tracked by the insect and spread as a surface toxin to other insects. once you have covered the areas take care that no food preparation or dusting occurs to prevent accidental ingestion.    this is an easy access to interior spaces in walls where roaches live and lay eggs. spray the borax into the space using your bottle like a bellows  squeezing repeatedly. replace the outlet covers when done. do not use dissolved borax.    the insecticide will spread among the colony through contact. complete coverage is desirable  but if any targeted areas have infestations  the insecticide will spread to other insects and kill them  and will not affect the desirability of food to the insects considerably.    the borax will destroy eggs and larvae in the carpet. vacuum up the powder some 20 minutes after application. any eggs or insects killed will go up with them. follow any rug care instructions.   if you targeted carpeted areas  vacuum a short time after application. any eggs will be killed in short order  but the insecticide dust can cause lung irritation or toxicity in pets and small children. it is not advisable to leave it in an area where it will be kicked up as dust continually.    reapply treatment after use  or after several days if roaches are still a problem. this is a relatively slow insecticide  but an extremely effective one. continue the treatment in this manner until the roaches are gone.  
query	181	make pancake buttermilk make pancake mix  when preparing any of the home style  dry buttermilk  liquid buttermilk  or sour cream pancake mixes  all the dry ingredients should be thoroughly mixed in a large mixing bowl.          when making a pancake mix  you should only combine the dry ingredients. each mix requires you to add liquid ingredients before cooking pancakes  but these liquid ingredients should not be included in stored mixes. for best results  sift together lumpy ingredients like flour and cornmeal before stirring them into the other ingredients. all purpose flour is standard in these recipes  but you can also substitute it for fine grain whole wheat flour if you want a healthier version. stir the ingredients with a whisk  wooden spoon  or large plastic mixing spoon. make sure the ingredients are mixed thoroughly.    if you have a large enough jar  you can combine the dry ingredients in the jar. after filling the jar  tightly secure a cap or lid to it. give the jar a vigorous shake to mix the ingredients together.          if you do not have a jar or container large enough to do this with the entire batch  you can cut the batch down to fit the jar you do have. leave at least 1 inch  2.5 cm  of empty space between the top of the mix and the top of the jar. this empty space is necessary to encourage easy movement within the jar  which is essential if you want to mix the pancake mix inside the jar.    each of the home style  dry buttermilk  liquid buttermilk  and sour cream pancake mixes can be cut into smaller amounts or multiplied into larger amounts. simply make sure to maintain the current ingredient proportions.           prepare a chocolate chip pancake mix by combining 1 4 cup to 1 2 cup  60 ml to 125 ml  of mini milk chocolate chips for every 2 cups  500 ml  of basic dry mix.          similarly  you can create white chocolate pancakes by replacing the milk chocolate chips with white chocolate chips. black and white pancakes can be made by combining 2 tbsp to 1 4 cup  30 ml to 60 ml  of white chocolate chips with equal parts milk chocolate chips. other baking chips you can consider combining with the mix include peanut butter chips and butterscotch chips. mini baking chips work best  but standard size chips can also be used. if these are too big for your liking  though  you can give them a rough chop with a sharp kitchen knife before tossing them into the dry pancake mix.    add 1 4 cup to 1 2 cup  60 ml to 125 ml  of finely chopped  unsalted nuts to 2 cups  500 ml  dry pancake mix.          you can use any sort of nut that appeals to you. some variations worth trying include peanuts  pecans  walnuts  and macadamia nuts. to create crunchy peanut butter pancakes  add 1 4 cup  60 ml  of chopped unsalted peanuts and 1 4 cup  60 ml  peanut butter baking chips to 2 cups  500 ml  dry pancake mix. you can also combine milk chocolate chips with peanuts  pecans  almonds  and most other nuts to create pancakes reminiscent of chocolate covered nuts.    fresh fruit cannot be added to pancake mix you plan to store  but if you prefer fruity pancakes  you can add various types of dried fruit to the mix. combine roughly 1 4 cup  60 ml  of dried fruit for every 1.5 to 2 cups  375 to 500 ml  dry basic pancake mix.          note that many types of dried fruit may be too large to include whole. in these instances  you should give the fruit a rough chop with a sharp kitchen knife before stirring the pieces into the dried mix. raisins  dried cherries  dried blueberries  dried strawberries  and dried apricots are a few types of dried fruit that work well in pancakes even without the addition of other customized ingredients. you can create tropical pancakes by mixing in equal parts dried pineapple  dried mango  and dried kiwi. for a flavor with greater dimension  combine nuts and fruit. chopped walnut chips go well with dried dates and dried cranberries  for instance.    a combination of ground cinnamon and dried nutmeg is a safe way to go. add roughly 2 tsp  10 ml  of cinnamon and 1 2 tsp  2.5 ml  nutmeg for every 3 cups  750 ml  flour used.          you can also add cinnamon to pancakes containing dried fruit like raisins or nuts like pecans.    fresh fruit should be added to the mix immediately before you cook it  not before you store it. do the same with other ingredients that have a limited shelf life  like flaked coconut.           each jar or container should have an airtight seal  and each needs to be labeled with the type of mix it contains and the date the mix was created. when stored this way  dry pancake mix can usually last for 3 months without any decline in quality.          the safest option is to label the jar with a date range. the beginning date should be when the mix was created and the end date should be your  use by  date. make sure that you check the expiration date of each ingredient used. if one of your ingredients expires sooner than 3 months  the entire batch of pancake mix will also expire with it. use a glass jar or plastic container. make sure the lid has a tight seal  and thoroughly wash and dry both the jar and lid before pouring your pancake mix in.    you should attach an index card with the preparation instructions written on it to the jar of pancake mix. this is true regardless of whether you plan on keeping the mix for yourself or giving it away to someone else.          for the homestyle pancake mix  combine 1 cup  250 ml  water with 1 cup  250 ml  dry mix  stirring until the lumps disappear. for the dry buttermilk and sour cream pancake mixes  whisk together one egg  2 tbsp  30 ml  melted butter or oil  and 3 4 cup  175 ml  water for every 1.5 cups  375 ml  dry mix used. stir the liquids together separately before whisking them into the dry pancake mix. for the liquid buttermilk pancakes  whisk together 2 egg whites and 2 cups  500 ml  buttermilk in a separate bowl. in another bowl  mix 2 egg yolks and 4 tbsp

query	182	play chess on internet  chess play blitz chess  you will also need to have chess pieces  and a chess clock. try going for a simple and small sized board. a smaller board will make it easier to move the pieces across the board. plastic or wooden boards are okay.it is also an option to play online. for this you will need a computer  tablet  or mobile phone that has internet connection. make sure the clock you choose is durable enough to handle the punching during the last few seconds of the game.    you will need to learn the rules before playing blitz chess. first  familiarize yourself with the rules of standard chess. the rules are basically the same in standard and blitz chess. the only differences are the number of illegal moves allowed  and the timing formats.one illegal move can mean a loss in a game of blitz chess.    anyone that knows how to play the game will do. consider your level of playing when choosing an opponent. don t start off with someone that is much more advanced than you when you are a beginner.  players sometimes lose because of finger fatigue. stretching your fingers will help circulation as you play.make a gentle fist. hold for thirty seconds. then  release and spread your fingers wide. repeat four times.place your palm flat on a table. straighten your fingers as flat as you can against the surface of the table. hold for thirty seconds. release and repeat four times.    the person playing white gets the privilege of moving first  but the person playing black chooses which side of the table to sit on.    this includes how the pieces are set up  the time on the clocks  and the clock s orientation. once play begins  none of these can be changed.   the time on the clocks should be set to the amount of time you want to play the game. in a blitz game  you should set the clock between one to ten minutes. the clock should be placed on either side of the chess board. black decides which side of the board to place the clock.  wait for your opponent to move if you re playing black.   after every move  you must hit the plunger on your side of the chess clock with the same hand you used to move the chess piece. this pauses your clock and starts your opponent s. if you forget to hit the clock  your opponent moves  and you catch it before they correct the mistake  it is considered an illegal move and your opponent loses the match. remember that the point of blitz chess is playing a fun  fast chess game. if you take too long to agonize over your moves  you ll lose. you should only take a few seconds at most to make a move.    ways of winning include    mating  checkmating  the king  by threatening to capture him on the next move in such a way that he cannot escape. your opponent can resign if there is no way to win. the small plastic flag on your opponent s clock falls before yours  indicating that he has run out of time. according to some rule sets  he can keep playing until you notice the flag fall and comment on it. you notice that your opponent made an illegal move before your next move. the chess game can also be declared a draw by mutual agreement  if there s no way for either to win  if the kings are stalemated  or if your opponent runs out of time or makes an illegal move  yet you don t have sufficient resources on the board to checkmate his king.    a game of blitz chess is not that different from any other game of chess. blitz chess is just played much faster. the fast paced game of blitz chess may be too overwhelming for someone who is new to the game of chess. a good way to get better at blitz chess is to improve your game of standard chess.  blitz chess can often seem harder than standard chess because the short time of the game makes the player emotional and excited. try playing a slightly longer game. playing a longer game will help you train to think clearly and rationally while playing.  the best way to improve at blitz chess is to play with more advances players that challenge you to better your game. it may get tiring to play with much more advanced players too often  so practice with other players of mixed levels of strength.try playing with a player that you beat 1 out of 4 to 1 of 8 games against. occasionally play with weaker players. this will build your confidence  and help the weaker players improve their games.    chess is thought to be 80  tactics  and it is not any different for blitz chess. pay attention to your and your opponent s positions while playing. spotting your opponent s tactics and tactical mistakes will give an advantage in the game.

query	184	take clenbuterol treat heaves in horses  the key to treating heaves is reducing your horse s exposure to allergens. since a stable has dust and other allergens in the air  increasing your horse s pasture time would give him more fresh air and less exposure to allergens. more time at pasture would also give your horse a chance to eat fresh grass  which does not have heaves inducing allergens.heaves that is made worse by stabling is called barn associated rao. if your horse has this form of heaves  leave him out on pasture as much as possible.another form of heaves  called pasture associated rao  can actually get worse with pasture time. if your horse has this type of heaves  limit his pasture time to only the winter months.if you are not able to increase your horse s pasture time  house him in a part of the stable that doesn t have a lot of airborne allergens.this could be a stall located closest to the stable entrance or near a window. at the time of diagnosis  your vet will be able to tell you the form of heaves affecting your horse.    whenever you bring your horse back in from pasture  the stable should be well ventilated. keep the stable s windows and doors open as often as possible.fresh air coming in from the outside will decrease the amount of allergens in the stable.if you keep the windows or doors open during the colder months  place a blanket on your horse to keep him warm. make sure the blanket fits him the straps of an ill fitting blanket can leave rub marks and sores on a horse s body.use large overhead fans to promote airflow and circulation throughout the barn. you can also use box fans to increase the airflow within your horse s stall. either way  make sure clean air is flowing into the horse s stall.    since hay contains allergens  storing it overhead could increase the level of those allergens in the air. rather than storing the hay overhead  keep it in an area completely removed from your horse  such as a storage trailer or other weatherproof building.if you must store hay in the barn  cover the hay with a large tarp to decrease the amount of circulating allergens.    low dust bedding is crucial to treating heaves in horses. examples of low dust bedding are chopped paper and chopped cardboard. straw is extremely dusty and is not recommended for bedding.particles in straw are fairly large and may not get far enough into the lungs to cause airway inflammation.nonetheless  you would be better off not taking the risk of worsening your horse s heaves with straw bedding.    cleaning your horse s stall will also reduce your horse s exposure to allergens  as long as it s done correctly. after putting your horse out to pasture  use a metal pitchfork to remove the manure and dirty bedding. then  use a shovel to pick up whatever fell through the slats of the pitchfork. if you see any damp spots on the floor  indicating urine   spray them with an absorbent deodorizer to remove the scent of ammonia.ammonia  which comes from decomposing urine  can irritate your horse s airways.it can take up to an hour for air particles to drift back down after cleaning  so do not return your horse to his stall until several hours after cleaning it.do not sweep the stable frequently. frequent sweeping will increase the level of airborne allergens.before sweeping  consider wetting the floor to reduce the amount of dust flying into the air.if you decide to sweep or use a blower to clean the stalls or barn aisle  do so when all the horses are turned out and the barn is empty.    spraying down the arena will minimize  to a small degree  the amount of dust flying around while working your horse. wetting down the arena should keep your horse more comfortable while exercising.  making changes to your horse s diet will also treat his heaves. since eating hay is a common cause of heaves in horses  you should take hay completely out of your horse s diet. in particular  do not feed your horse round bale hay  which has a high dust content.avoiding hay is especially important if your horse has severe heaves. when a horse eats hay  especially round bale hay  he buries his nose in it. moving his nose through the hay causes dust to fly up into the air  causing him to breathe it in  which severely exacerbates heaves.  if removing hay from your horse s diet is not possible  consider soaking it in water before feeding it to him. soaking the hay overnight will reduce the hay s nutrient content  so soak it for only about 15 minutes.make sure your horse eats the immediately. if not  the wet hay will dry out and grow mold.soaking hay can be helpful for mild cases of heaves.unfortunately  soaking hay can worsen a severe case of heaves.discuss the pros and cons of soaking hay with your vet. they can recommend whether it would be a good treatment strategy for your horse. consider getting a large commercial soaker that will steam your hay in big batches if you are feeding a lot of horses. hay steamers wash the hay and kill mold and bacteria.  while out on pasture  your horse will have access to grass  which is one of the best things your horse can eat. in the winter  when there is not much grass on the ground  feed your horse a complete pelleted feed  which is low in dust and provides the nutrients your horse needs to stay healthy.consider feeding your horse the pelleted feed as a supplement to grass.follow the label instructions to determine how much feed to give your horse. talk with your vet if you are not sure which pelleted feed to purchase for your horse.    other than grass and pelleted feed  several other low dust foods are good for horses with heaves. examples of these foods are silage  alfalfa pellets  and alfalfa cubes.alfalfa is a type of hay  but is low in dust when in pelleted or cubed form.   your horse may actually prefer hay cubes or silage over the complete feed.  feeding your horse off the ground keeps his airway open and keeps him from inhaling dust and allergens off the ground. it also allows for any bits of hay and dust to settle on the ground below where your horse won t eat.  if your horse has mild or moderate heaves  then changes to his diet and environment could be all that he needs for treatment.many horses with heaves  though  require additional treatment with medications. corticosteroids  steroids  for short  reduce inflammation  making them very effective for heaves treatment.steroids can be given either intravenously or by mouth.intravenous dexamethasone  one type of steroid  is effective in treating severe cases of heaves. prednisolone  another steroid  has fewer side effects than dexamethasone. it is usually used to treat less severe cases of heaves.prolonged steroid use can have serious side effects in horses. to prevent these side effects  your vet will gradually taper your horse s steroid dosage.  a bronchodilator relaxes the airways  allowing a horse to breathe more easily. this type of medication can provide immediate relief to airway obstruction. bronchodilators come in several formulations  injectable  oral  and aerosolized. aerosolized bronchodilators  which a horse can breathe in  are especially useful for horses with severe heaves.bronchodilators can also clear mucus from the lungs. their effects last about 1 to 3 hours. clenbuterol and albuterol are types of bronchodilators that are available a local drugstores with a veterinarian s prescription. because bronchodilators do not treat inflammation  they cannot be the sole treatment for heaves. they must be given with steroids.   if your horse needs long term steroid use  your vet may recommend a low dose  aerosolized steroid. an aerosolized steroid has fewer side effects than a systemic steroid. be aware that aerosolized steroids are expensive  since you would have to purchase the mask to administer the medication. despite the cost  this formulation would provide targeted relief of your horse s airway inflammation.aerosolized steroids are not given when beginning heaves treatment because the airways may be too obstructed for the medication to work effectively.  non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs and antihistamines have not shown much benefit in horses with heaves.do not use these medications to treat your horse if has heaves.

query	186	buy raw milk product dairy product drink milk for better health  studies have shown that organic milk is much healthier than regular milk. some benefits of organic milk is the fact that organic milk is from cows that haven t been given growth hormones  it is wholesome  produced without harmful pesticides  etc.   organic milk isn t produced with antibiotics. overuse of antibiotics is a serious health problem. today  of all the main places that antibiotics is overused is in agriculture. organic milk comes from cows that were not given antibiotics  so it doesn t contribute to the growing problem of bacterial resistance. organic milk is very high in conjugated linoleic acids  cla . clas are important healthy fats that has been proven to have been linked to reduced heart disease and diabetes. as a matter of fact  in the may 9th issue of the archives of internal medicine  researchers from massachusetts general hospital and the harvard school of public health reported that dairy products that are low in fat  including milk  is shown to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes  in men . another big advantage of organic milk over regular milk is its ability to go for a long time without turning sour  organic milk is heated to around 280  f  138  c   so it would take up to two months for it to turn sour. because of the fact that regular  pasteurized milk is heated to 145  f  63  c   it doesn t have the same life. so if you are worried about milk turning sour fairly quickly  then organic milk may actually allow you to save money. understand that it s the right thing to do. organic cows must be able to access open air  unlike factory cows. cows that produce organic milk  or organic cows from many dairy farms are allowed to graze freely in organic pasture. this type of farming is considerate to animals  and isn t cruel  is very supportive of wildlife  good for many rural communities  respectful of air  water and soil  and is healthy for people.    rather than putting milk in your tea  try putting in honey instead. also  try to put milk inside coffee rather than tea  as milk doesn t affect coffee.     protein  a good source of energy  builds and repairs your muscle tissue  good after work outs.  potassium  helps you keep a good blood pressure.  phosphorus  helps strengthen your bones and gives you energy.  vitamin d  helps your body maintain your bones.  vitamin b12  helps maintain healthy red blood cells and helps maintain nerve tissue.  vitamin a  helps maintain the immune system  helps maintain normal vision and good skin.  niacin  improves your metabolism  have a glass before doing aerobics.   the usda has shown drinking milk to prevent osteoporosis  because of its nutrients  calcium and vitamin d. other evidence shows the intake of milk and milk products is linked to improved bone health and the reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.   pasteurization kills bacteria and other harmful microorganisms that are found in raw milk  and it is dangerous to drink raw milk.   be sure to read the label. safe milk  meaning pasteurized milk  will have the word  pasteurized  on the label. if the word  pasteurized  is not found on the label of a product  it may contain raw milk. do not be afraid to ask your grocer or store clerk whether milk or dairy products have been pasteurized  especially milk or milk products sold in refrigerated cases. do not buy milk or milk products at farm stands or farmers  markets unless you can confirm that it has been pasteurized.   heartburn is caused a lot of the time by acidity  so logically milk naturally relieves heartburn.    for thousands of years  milk has been known to keep skin clear. the lactic acid found in milk aids in removing dead skin cells  and therefore keeps your skin clear and rejuvenated.  milk has been shown to protect the enamel against acidic foods. also  the calcium and vitamin d found in milk keeps bones strong  although teeth are not considered bones.   many dieters do not consume dairy  because they think that milk will not help them lose weight. recent studies performed by the ben gurion university has shown that including more calcium in your diet may lead to continuous weight loss. drinking 12 ounces  580 g  of milk every day assists the loss of more than 12 lbs on average  while people who only consume a cup of milk a day lose on average 7 lbs.  
query	187	drink diet coke make a diet coke and mentos rocket  for the purposes of this example  we re using diet coke  but you can actually use any type of diet soda  as long as it contains aspartame .   warm soda causes better explosions  so avoid using cold refrigerated soda.for best results  purchase room temperature soda and then let it sit outside in the sun or in a pot full of hot  not boiling  water for a few hours before using it.    experiments have shown that while the original mint mentos will give you a longer explosion  mentos fruit will give you slightly shorter but more intense explosion.other experiments have shown that mint mentos are the better choice because the gum arabic found in the mint coating reduces surface tension and quickens the carbon dioxide s escape from the bottle  making for a more intense explosion.as the rocket is more of a fast acting affair  you might want to go for mint mentos. if you have the time and money to do so  why not try one bottle with mint mentos and one with fruit mentos  and then compare the results     you probably have this one lying around your house already  but if you don t  you should be able to buy a roll just about anywhere  hardware stores are a safe bet .    wearing goggles will not only protect your eyes from the soda mentos concoction  but also from any other debris  for example  the lid  that might fly out from the bottle once it hits the ground and explodes.    your rocket is likely to bounce around like crazy  make sure it has enough room to do that. if you re in a parking lot  make sure there are no cars nearby for at least a 50 foot radius  if not more.   if there s a field or empty lot nearby  go there to make your rocket. you don t want to risk doing damage to anyone s car or home  as it could cost you or your parents a lot of money to repair.    it s possible you ll get covered in the sticky diet coke mentos solution. wear clothes and shoes that you don t mind getting wet and sticky   preferably ones that are easy to wash.    bring your 2 liter bottle of diet coke  your pack of mentos  your masking tape  and your safety goggles to wherever you ve decided to build your rocket.    place the strips of tape on a flat surface  with their sticky sides facing up. do not allow them to stick together.    the more mentos you use  the better the explosion  however  you don t want to the mentos to dip too far into the diet coke otherwise the explosion may begin before you can screw the lid on the bottle.    they should look just as they did when they were still in their original packaging  stacked on top of one another like a roll of coins.    be sure to leave the sides of the mentos exposed.    you ll use this piece to attach the mentos to the bottle cap  so ensure that it s small enough to fit inside the cap.    take the 3 inch strip of sticky rolled tape that you ve just created and attach it to the top of the taped roll of mentos. this will create a  loaded  mentos cartridge that you can place inside the diet coke bottle.    put the cap on a flat surface  with its inside facing upwards. place the mentos cartridge  sticky tape side up  into the soda cap and press down to fasten it there.   be careful not to press too hard  as you don t want any mentos falling out of the cartridge     this step is optional. if you re worried about the mentos prematurely falling into the diet coke  you can secure the cartridge by running one more piece of masking tape around the entire roll  including the cap.    the cap should be securely on the bottle  but not closed too tightly. if it s closed too tightly  the cap might not come off when you throw the bottle  and the rocket won t work. as you twist the cap on  you ll also want to make sure that the mentos do not touch the diet coke yet.  if it seems like the mentos will touch the diet coke  you can either dump a small amount of diet coke out before screwing the cap on  redo your mentos cartridge to contain fewer mentos  or you can try your luck and screw the cap on as quickly as possible.    shake it so that the mentos fall into the diet coke  and then keep shaking. do this for at least a few seconds.    there are several different methods for  launching  your rocket    a popular and effective one is to throw the bottle high up into the air and let it fall on to the ground  preferably hard ground  like cement . this is the best method if you re worried about getting hit by the rocket  as you can throw it far away from you and even run in the opposite direction. another method is to throw the bottle at a side angle so that when it hits the ground  the ground knocks off its cap. yet another method is to throw the bottle at more of a 90 degree angle  cap first  on to the ground.    you can skip this step if your rocket works right away. if the rocket doesn t go off when you throw it  pick it up and try unscrewing the cap a little before throwing it again. just be careful not to unscrew the cap too far  otherwise you re likely to end up covered in diet coke.  when the bottle hits the ground  its cap should fly off and the diet coke mentos solution will shoot out of the bottle s opening. this should cause the bottle to fly high up into the air. depending on how you throw it  the bottle might also bounce around sporadically for several seconds.   side angle launches generally seem to cause the bottle to bounce low and skid along the ground. vertical launches  in which you throw the bottle straight up into the air and let it fall to the ground  tend to give the rocket more height as it shoots upward. if the bottle is still full of diet coke and mentos but it s stopped moving on the ground  you can try to launch it again to see if it has any more flight left in it.    once you ve finished your experiment  don t forget to pick up after yourself. clean up any bits of tape or mentos packaging that might have dropped to the ground as you built your rocket. and pick up the rocket  clean out the bottle and put it in the recycling bin  or bring it to the bottle depot .    the more mentos  the better the explosion. experiment with putting different amounts of mentos into the diet coke bottle to see what yields the best explosion.    studies have shown that mint and fruit mentos yield different explosions. try mixing them together in one cartridge and adding them to your diet coke bottle to see what sort of explosion they cause when they are mixed together.    fill an empty 4 liter milk jug with 4 liters  2 two liter bottles  of diet coke. leave enough room at the top to add at least an 8 mento cartridge.   as with the original rocket recipe  stick the mentos cartridge to the lid of the milk jug  fasten the lid  shake the container to release the mentos into the diet coke  then throw the jug high up into the air and let it hit the pavement hard.    get together with your friends and each make your own rocket. set up a flag or some other way of measuring height  and have a judge watch and name the winner.  
query	188	drink diet soda if have diabetes diet drink choose diabetes friendly cocktails  you may want to try vodka cocktails  like a vodka martini or vodka and sugar free fresca. these drinks generally don t contain many carbs  so they won t spike your blood sugar too much. make sure to drink these in moderation  though.make sure to be careful of the garnish of a martini. olives  strawberries  oranges  and other garnishes may have been soaked in sugar  which can add unnecessary carbs and sugars. make sure the rim isn t lined with sugar either.    a bloody mary may be a good cocktail choice when you have diabetes. the tomato juice has less carbs than a juice used in other drinks  such as orange juice. if you use low sodium tomato juice it s even better.a bloody mary has approximately seven carbs.    if you would like to enjoy a beer with your friends  you can have one. just make sure that you go for light beer. light beer has lower amounts of carbohydrates  usually three to six grams. make sure to stick to a 12 ounce beer. skip large sizes  such as a 32 ounce.avoid craft beers. they have more carbs  alcohol  and calories than normal beer.    red or white wine can be heart healthy  so a glass each night is okay even if you have diabetes. however  make sure that you are drinking dry reds or whites. they both only have around four carbs for a glass.don t drink flavored wines or dessert wines. these have more sugar  which can cause your blood sugar to spike.    drinks you can sip instead of finish quickly may be a better option when you have diabetes. this allows you to drink them slowly so your body can process them  and it lessens the risk of you ordering multiple drinks. sherry is a great choice for this. order a sherry and sip on it for awhile.a two ounce glass of sherry has approximately eight grams of carbs.    another tasty diabetic friendly alternative is a wine spritzer. this is a cocktail made with wine  club soda  and ice. the club soda adds a bit of carbonation to the wine  making it more bubbly. ask for a twist of lemon or lime on the side.this is a cocktail you can easily make at home. you can also ask a restaurant or bar if they can make you one.    many cocktails contain sugary juices and syrups that can negatively affect your blood sugar levels. these drinks generally contain higher levels of sugar and lower levels of alcohol. skip these drinks for drinks that don t contain heavy sugared mixers.  liquor inherently doesn t have a lot of sugar or carbs. this means you can have a one ounce drink without messing your blood sugar up too much. try placing the liquor with plain water or some seltzer water.seltzer water can give your drink a bit of a bubbly taste without added calories.    another option for a calorie free  low carb mixed drink is one made with club soda or diet tonic water. most bars and restaurants will have club soda  and many will have diet tonic water.you can also buy club soda or diet tonic water at the grocery store to make a cocktail at home.    you can have mixed drinks like margaritas and mojitos in moderation. however  make sure to make them with sugar free mixes. if you would like to make mojitos and martinis  you can use an alternative to sugar  like stevia.  fruity drinks don t have to be completely cut out. when you make mixed drinks  like daiquiris  consider using all fresh fruit for the mixture instead of a syrup or bottled mix. this can help cut added sugar and give you the same fruity flavor.  if you like mixed drinks with soda  drink the same thing with a sugar free or diet version. a cocktail made with sugar free or diet soda has no carbs  unlike one made with regular soda. regular soda may contain over 20 grams of carbs.when making them at home  you can add a diet coke to your whiskey and coke  or ask for diet when ordering one at a restaurant or bar.    most people who have diabetes can drink small amounts of alcohol. however  you want to make sure to drink in moderation. too much alcohol can negatively affect your blood sugar.due to the risks of drinking with diabetes  it is best to err on the side of caution regarding the number of drinks you consume. women should stick one alcoholic drink per day. men should only have two drinks in a day.  when you have diabetes and decide to have a drink  make sure to limit the serving size. many cocktails  beers  or wines you can get at a restaurant or bar are too large. try thinking about the following serving sizes 12 ounces of beer 5 ounces of wine 1.5 ounces of liquor 1.5 ounce of liqueur    you should never drink on an empty stomach. you should also not substitute your carbs or sugars from a meal as alcohol. eating regular meals helps your body process the alcohol and alcohol sugars.you should also check your blood sugar to make sure your blood sugar is stable.    it is important that you always wear a medical id bracelet that indicates that you have diabetes. this is especially important if you take insulin or diabetes medications. this will help protect you if your blood sugar drops.being buzzed and having low blood sugar looks similar. to avoid a diabetic emergency  make sure those around you are aware of your condition.    pay extra close attention to your blood sugar levels over the 24 hours after drinking alcohol. also  watch for the signs of hypoglycemia while you are drinking  and keep in mind that the effects of alcohol may make it difficult for you to notice the symptoms.be sure that the people who are with you know you have diabetes and understand that if you pass out it is a medical emergency  not a sign of intoxication.  there are some other simple things that you can do to protect yourself while you are drinking. these include

query	191	play french horn play the french horn  as with any instrument  there s a proper way to hold your french horn to get the best sound possible when you play it.   sit up in a chair with your back straight so that you can breathe into the horn without obstruction. put your feet flat on the floor  parallel to each other. hold the horn at a 45 degree angle with the mouthpiece toward your face. cup your hand and place your left thumb on the thumb key. put your left index  middle  and ring fingers on the three keys on top. your left pinkie should be through pinkie ring  and your right hand inside of the bell. now that your fingers are in place  bring the horn up so that the mouthpiece is against your lips.    to blow into the mouthpiece  you have to first learn how to purse your lips. this is called   embouchure.    practice saying   mmmm  with your mouth  slowly adding pressure between your lips. your lips should form a frown. the corners of your mouth should stay in place  almost as if you re puckering your lips.it s a good idea to practice in front of a mirror to make sure you re getting your form right.  without pressing any of the valves  you can use the embouchure technique to blow into the mouthpiece of the horn.   you want to blow into the horn using fast  quick blows.make sure you re not pressing your mouth into the mouthpiece too hard. if your teeth hurt or a ring appears on your lips  you re pressing too hard. you want a relaxed tension against the mouthpiece when you blow into it.  it will make your life a lot easier to learn exactly where the keys are so that your fingers know where to go when you re playing.   through repeated playing muscle memory builds  so your fingers know where the keys are. practices pressing the keys  knowing which keys you re pressing. do this until you can pass a test of accuracy.it can help to have a fingering chart while you practice.  the volume of the notes you play will depend on how much air you blow into the horn  and how fast. the more air you blow  and the faster you blow it  the louder the note will sound  and vice versa .  to be a good french horn player you ll want to learn how to read music.   sheet music is the basis of many musical performances. you can also learn by ear  but most songs are played from sheet music. learning sheet music gives you a deeper understanding of how your instrument works  as well as music theory.  the most basic thing you ll learn first is the order of the notes and how they re placed on a music staff.many parts go into the relationship between notes and the staff. that s why this piece is so fundamental.    once you ve memorized the notes  the next step is to understand how the clefs work.there are two clefs that can show up on a music staff. the treble clef notates the higher pitches of music  and the bass clef notates the lower pitches.    sheet music notates how fast or slow a song is by the tempo. it s usually notated at the top of the sheet using a bpm  beats per minute  measurement.  once you have a pretty good understanding of the basics of sheet music  try playing a simple melody. pick something that only has a few notes and practice until you ve mastered it.    eventually  you can practice playing more complex melodies. this will help you play your instrument better and help you become better at reading sheet music.   pick music that has a variety of note structures  clefs  and tempos.    now that you can hold your instrument and play sitting down  it s time to play standing up. a french horn weighs about 4 pounds. there won t be many times when you ll need to play standing up  but recitals are a common one.since your right hand is in the bell anyway  just slide it up to the top of the bell so that it s resting on your hand. all your other hand placements stay the same. you can buy small modification pieces that help hold up the horn easier.    once you ve mastered the basics you re ready to learn more advanced playing techniques. it can be helpful to recruit a tutor or advanced player for these skills.   muting  or stopping  the horn creates a high pitched sound from the bell. you can stop the horn by moving your hand further into the bell until it s in all the way. twist it until little or no air can get out.slurring notes are playing two notes without stopping or releasing between. to do this you ll continue to change the notes on your keys but your airflow remains constant and steady.playing glissando is starting and ending on specific notes while playing as many notes between as you can.  lessons are a great way to learn advanced skills and get feedback on your progress. you can hire private tutors or join group classes. some classes will play at events  giving you an opportunity to show off your new chops.    you can find a lot of useful tutorial videos online. some of them will teach you to play using sheet music  and some will teach you to play by ear. if you search  you should find what you re looking for.    the most effective way to become a better horn player is to practice. make time to play your horn on a regular basis. create challenges for yourself by upping the ante on songs you play.   you can get books of sheet music that have a variety of songs with different levels of difficulty. tutor books sometimes include training schedules  often with lessons on reading sheet music.  don t be afraid to ask questions when you get stuck or aren t sure how to do something. there are lots of places you can go to get your questions answered.   you can consult tutors  french horn websites  video comment threads  and forums.    when you re not playing your horn  store it in a padded case. most cases have a hard shell to protect it from damage.    each time you play your horn you should clean it. this will prolong the life of the instrument.   polish it using a polishing cloth. if it s dirty  you can apply polishing gauze with a cloth.let the interior of the instrument dry. remove the valve slides and dry those while the rest of the body is drying.  every week or two you ll want to conduct routine maintenance on your instrument to make sure it stays in good condition for as long as possible.   clean the mouthpiece with dish soap and water. it might also be helpful to use a mouthpiece brush  which you can find at most music stores.oil the rotors and valves. remove the valve caps and apply key oil to the pivot points and bearing shaft.you ll know the valves need to be oiled if they stick.apply slide grease to the tuning slides. remove them  put the grease on them  and replace them.  every once in a while  you should do a full cleanse on your horn. that means flushing out the entire instrument with soap and water. use a brush to clean the tuning slides.if you want to take special care you can use brass soap to clean the horn.make sure you apply grease to the tuning slides before putting them back on the body of the horn.  if anything on your horn breaks  take it to a shop and get it repaired. it s a delicate piece of machinery that won t work if some of the parts are defective.  
query	192	drive a manual transmission gear stick troubleshoot your transmission  any time you hear grinding while driving your vehicle means trouble. grinding while trying to put a manual transmission into or out of gear can be indicative of your clutch failing to engage or disengage completely or it may be a result of worn synchro gears in the transmission itself. if you hear grinding while in gear  it means there is metal caught in the gears of the transmission and it will likely fail very soon.pull the vehicle over immediately if you hear grinding while moving. you will need to have your vehicle towed home or to a repair facility. if the transmission grinds going into or out of certain gears  you can try double clutch shifting to get it through the gears without causing more damage.    there are many things that can cause vibrations as you drive. while some may be as benign as a rock stuck in your tire or ice on your rims  others can indicate a serious issue with your transmission. if you hear or feel a new vibration as you drive  pull over and check your wheels and tires first. if they appear not to have any issues to speak of  the vibration is likely due to a problem with the drivetrain.the drivetrain in your vehicle includes the engine  transmission  transfer cases and drive shafts. try to get a sense of wear in the vehicle the vibration is coming from.    while driving and diagnosing a vibration  accelerate by pressing on the gas and assess whether or not the vibration speeds up  slows down or goes away. now take the vehicle out of gear  in neutral  and press on the gas again. determine if there is a difference between how the vibration acts in each instance. if the vibration only occurs at certain speeds  it may be an unbalanced wheel. if the vibration goes away or stays constant while the vehicle is not in gear  it may be an issue with the wheels or drive shafts going to them. if the vibration increases with the rpms of the engine  the issue is likely in the engine or transmission.    when driving a vehicle equipped with an automatic transmission  pay attention to the way it shifts from gear to gear. automatic transmissions should shift fairly smoothly. if shifting feels abrupt or causes you to lurch forward  the transmission is struggling to shift into the next gear.hard shifting could indicate low or over worn transmission fluid. pull over at a safe location and ensure the transmission fluid is not too low before driving the vehicle home.    automatic transmissions are designed to shift at different rpms based on the amount of throttle you input. if you are accelerating quickly  with the pedal to the floor  the transmission will shift at a higher rpm than under normal driving. that said  the transmission should not allow the vehicle to sit at a high rpm for long before shifting to the next gear. if it is  there is an issue.you can usually hear when your car plateau s at an rpm it should be shifting from. listen for the sound of the engine working harder than it normally would as it stays in a lower gear for too long.    a common cause of issues with automatic transmissions is low fluid levels caused by leaks. look beneath your vehicle for wet spots. if you find one  touch it with your finger  then wipe your finger on a white sheet of paper to determine what kind of fluid it is by color.automatic transmission fluid is usually red  or dark red if it is old and has been burned. coolant is usually green or orange. oil is usually brown or black.    if you have seen signs of leaking  check your transmission immediately by locating the dip stick for your transmission fluid. much like an oil dipstick  there will be minimum and full lines clearly shown on the stick. remove the dipstick and wipe it off  then re insert it and remove it again to check the fluid levels. if the fluid level is low  adding transmission fluid may resolve the issue you re having. if you are unsure where to find the transmission fluid dipstick in your vehicle  refer to its owner s manual for guidance. check the transmission fluid levels even if there is no sign of leaking  just in case it was not filled completely when it was last serviced or if it has been burning fluid.    look at the fluid on the dipstick and assess the color. automatic transmission fluid is dark red in color  but it grows darker the longer it is in use. dark color is not necessarily indicative of an issue unless it is nearly black in color and smells burnt. conversely  if the color is extremely light or pink  it means water has gotten into the transmission fluid  which is also a serious problem. draining and flushing your transmission fluid is not always a viable solution  but in some cases it is required.black or extremely dark red transmission fluid means the transmission has been operating at above its safe temperature range. pink transmission fluid means there s water in the fluid. you will need to drain the transmission and replace the fluid. the source of the water in your transmission fluid must be identified and repaired or it will occur again.    with your foot on the brake  shift your vehicle out of park and into reverse or drive. while at a stop  shifting out of park should be nearly instantaneous. count to yourself as you wait. if your count exceeds three seconds  the transmission is not operating the way it should. this may be indicative of over worn or low transmission fluid.sluggish shifting  particularly into drive or reverse  often means the transmission fluid is too low or not performing properly. if the vehicle won t shift out of park at all  it could mean that the transmission has internal issues and will need to be serviced or replaced.    while stopped with the vehicle running  apply the parking brake and press the clutch pedal to the floor. shift the transmission through each gear  starting with first and culminating with the highest gear your vehicle s transmission is equipped with. it should shift into each gear smoothly and without any grinding or crunching.if the vehicle cannot shift into any gears  your clutch may have failed. if you have issues shifting into a specific gear  it is likely the result of a failed synchro for that gear.    manual transmissions are usually lubricated by gear oil instead of automatic transmission fluid  except in specific applications . many manual transmissions have dipsticks similar to those found in automatic transmissions. remove the dipstick and ensure the fluid level is correct.if you are unable to find the dipstick on your transmission  refer to your owner s manual for guidance. if you need to add gear oil  be sure to check your owner s manual for the correct type of oil to add.    when checking the gear oil in your transmission  determining if it has been burned through overheating will be fairly easy. burned gear oil has a powerful odor that may resemble onions. if the gear oil in your transmission is burned  it will making shifting more difficult and may lead to a breakdown of the components inside.burned gear oil will need to be drained and replaced. if the wrong gear oil is added  it may be more likely to burn and lead to mechanical failures. if the wrong oil has been added to your transmission  it will also need to be drained and replaced.    if you hear a noise that seems to come from the transmission at an idle  press the clutch in and continue to listen. if the sound changes or stops  it is likely caused by a problem with the release or pilot bearing. other common issues you may be able to diagnose by sound are a growling or grinding noises when the clutch is engaged likely means a problem with the transmission input shaft bearing. if you depress the clutch and hear a squealing sound  it is likely caused by a bad pilot bearing or bushing. a chirping sound that gets louder as you slowly depress the clutch pedal is likely caused by a faulty release bearing.

query	194	recommend guitar amplifier get rid of feedback from your amp  high gain on a guitar is a common culprit for feedback. max gain increases the input signal until the output reaches maximum levels.if it s too high on either your amp or your guitar  it could be creating feedback.   there should be at least two knobs on the face of your guitar. one of these should be the gain. turn this counter clockwise to reduce the gain. you can keep the gain at three fourths max or less on both your amp and guitar to prevent feedback. if you are still experiencing it  try turning it down even lower.    try turning down the volume on your guitar knob while turning the volume on your amplifier up. this will increase the output while decreasing the input and could prevent feedback. you should always try to alter the volume of your music by your amp  and not with the guitar s knob to prevent instant feedback as soon as you plug in your guitar.   another knob on the body of your guitar should control the volume. turn this counter clockwise to reduce your volume. some guitars have numbers  1 10 to designate the level of sound. if yours does  turn it to 8. if the knob on your guitar is not working  see if you can buy a replacement knob at a guitar store. if that doesn t work  you may have to take it to get repaired.    high treble and low bass can create feedback. make sure that the levels that you re playing create the most robust sound while eliminating any feedback. test this by playing notes on your guitar while adjusting each knob separately.   all amps are different so you will most likely have to change the levels on your amplifier a couple of times to see what works best.    jimi hendrix made feedback popular by playing his guitar in front of his amp.this is actually the main way that feedback can be produced when you play music  so make sure that your instrument or microphone is not picking up the noise from your amplifier.   even though your amplifier may not have a direct line to your input  it s still possible that sound waves are bouncing off reflective surfaces. move things like tables and chairs to eliminate reflective surfaces that may be bouncing sound back into your input.    pointing your amp towards the wall may stifle the sound but it will also prevent any feedback. because sound waves won t be directly playing into your input  it s unlikely that you will get feedback.   pick up or roll your amplifier towards a wall and leave around 2 3 inches from the amp and the wall. putting your amp on a carpet instead of a hardwood floor will reduce reverberations throughout the house.    even if you re not pointing your instrument or microphone directly into the amplifier  your inputs could still be picking up sound waves produced by amp. if you have a long enough cord  move further away from the amp.   put the amplifier in front of you  pointing outwards. this will also help you if you are on stage and are experiencing a lot of feedback. buying a longer cord will allow you the freedom to move around while you are playing.    if you have a distortion pedal plugged into the amp  that could be the source of the feedback you re hearing. distortion or effect pedals can create feedback when the effects are turned too high. try turning down both the level and the gain knobs.   certain pedals are capable of creating more feedback. overdrive effects for heavy metal or hardcore music have a greater chance of creating unintended feedback than a blues or jazz pedal because of the intended sound. try unplugging your guitar from the pedal and plug your guitar directly into the amp. if there is no feedback  then the pedal is your culprit.    if you have an equalizer  you can turn down the frequency range for the guitar that you have plugged in. this will effectively eliminate all feedback because it won t register through the equalizer.external or add on equalizers may be more effective at eliminating your feedback. depending on the quality of your amplifier  an external component may be better quality than the one that comes with your amp. electric guitar frequency range is 80 hz to about 1200 hz.you may have to test different frequencies for your specific guitar. lower the frequency by turning the knob counter clockwise within your range.    a noise suppressor is made to eliminate feedback  humming  and any other unwanted noise that is coming from your amp. this pedal does not affect the guitar s natural tone  but does cost money. if you absolutely can not get rid of your feedback  or want a cleaner sound on your guitar  this is an option.   turn the noise reduction knob clockwise to reduce the ambient sound and feedback from the guitar. play with the threshold knob until you do not hear static from your amp. you have to find the level for your specific guitar and amp.  
query	195	use hair dryer choose a blow dryer  ionic or tourmaline hair dryers give off negative ions that help break up the water droplets on your hair for faster drying. as a result  your hair is less likely to be frizzy after you dry it. if you have thick  frizz prone hair  shop for a dryer that has an ionic or tourmaline interior for the best results.tourmaline is a semi precious metal that provides the most intense ionic action. a tourmaline dryer is likely to be more expensive than a regular ionic dryer. however  if you have extremely thick or frizzy hair  it may be a good investment. an ionic or tourmaline dryer is also good for any type of hair that s difficult to dry. if you have fine or thin hair  avoid ionic dryers. they aren t as effective in building volume as other types of blow dryers.    blow dryers that feature plastic or metal housing that s coated in ceramic or porcelain provide heat that s less harsh and more consistent  so they re a good choice for fine or dry hair that dehydrates easily. if you re not sure what type of dryer to purchase  a ceramic or porcelain model is actually good for all hair types.ceramic or porcelain dryers also use negative ions to prevent frizz and allow you to dry your hair more quickly. some ceramic or porcelain dryers feature infrared technology. that means they use longer energy waves that penetrate the hair so it s dried from the inside out.    a titanium blow dryer provides heat at a steady  even temperature. it tends to get very hot  though  so it s not a good choice for fine or damaged hair. however  if you have extremely thick hair or lots of hair  a titanium blow dryer can drastically help reduce your drying time.titanium weighs less than ceramic or porcelain  so the dryer is usually lightweight. that makes it more comfortable to hold when you have a lot of hair to dry.    a blow dryer s wattage measures how hard and fast its motor works. the higher its wattage  the faster you ll be able to dry your hair. dryers with a low wattage are usually cheaper  but you ll need to replace them more often than those with a higher wattage. for at home use  look for a dryer whose wattage is at least 1350.if you have extremely thick  difficult to dry hair  opt for a dryer with a wattage between 1800 to 2000. that will help you dry your hair more quickly.    it may seem like a minor detail  but it s important to consider the weight of a blow dryer. you want a lightweight model that will be more comfortable to hold while you re drying your hair. that makes your blowout easier.for the most comfortable drying experience  look for a blow dryer that s approximately 1 pound  454 g  in weight.    while it helps to have a dryer that s made with the right material and proper wattage  you also want a model that allows you to adjust the heat level. search for a dryer that provides low  medium  and high heat settings so you can use the precise amount of heat that your hair requires.for fine  thin  or dry hair  the low heat setting is usually enough to effectively dry your hair. for normal hair  the medium setting is usually enough to effectively dry your hair. for coarse  thick hair  the high heat setting is usually enough to effectively dry your hair.    if you want shiny  sleek hair  choose a blow dryer that features a cool shot setting. that allows you to blast your hair with cool air when you re nearly finished drying your hair to seal the cuticle for smooth  shiny hair.switch from the heat setting to the cool setting when your hair is approximately 80  dry. it will finish drying your hair with overheating it.    a diffuser is an attachment that distributes the hot air in a larger area without blowing your hair all over the place. it s particularly helpful if you have curly or wavy hair because it helps keep the texture intact while still adding volume.a diffuser typically snaps onto the end of the blow dryer. it is removable so you can only use it when you want to.    like a diffuser  a concentrator nozzle snaps onto the end of a blow dryer. however  it emits the air in a concentrated stream so it s a handy tool if you regularly straighten your hair your hair with your dryer. it can also help cut down on frizz.when you use the concentrator nozzle  always keep it pointed downward and never allow it to come into contact with your hair.run a brush through your hair as you re drying it  and follow the path of the brush with the concentrator nozzle for super straight  sleek hair.

query	197	connect to the computer hard disk drive add an extra hard drive to your computer  before we start the process of adding a drive  we need to do a small amount of research inside your machine. the goal of the research is to find out if it will be easy or not to add the new hard drive. we also need to find out what kind of drive you need to buy. you may be able to do this research by reading through your computer s manuals  but it is far easier to simply open the case and look inside.   the first question to answer is  how many hard disk drives have already been installed inside the case  in the majority of machines  the answer to this question is  one.  having only one hard disk drive installed makes it easy to install another one. after you open up your computer s case and look inside  you will probably find one optical drive  a cd or dvd drive   a single hard disk drive and perhaps a floppy disk drive. the optical and floppy drives will be easy to find because you can see them on the outside of the case. the hard drive may take a little searching. if you have no idea what a hard drive looks like  look at the photo above. if there are already two drives installed inside your case  then adding a new one is more difficult.    is there space available to add another hard disk drive  your current hard disk is probably mounted in a small metal cage or rack inside the machine. make sure there is space available in the cage for another drive. if not  adding an external drive is an option.   an external drive connects to your computer through either a usb 2.0 connection or a firewire connection  so your computer needs to have usb 2.0 or firewire connectors. once you buy the drive  all you have to do is connect it and fire up your computer. the drive will come with configuration instructions  but on windows xp and other modern systems  it will likely be plug and play. you can start saving files on your new drive immediately. there is one big advantage to an external drive  you can plug it into multiple machines and move files around. you can take it with you anywhere you go. the only real disadvantage is that it will be slower than an internal drive. if it takes a minute to copy a gigabyte of data on an internal drive  it might take two minutes on an external drive. that may or may not be important depending on what you want to do. for most applications  the slower speed is irrelevant.    there are two systems in common use  ide drives  also known as pata  or parallel ata   and sata  serial ata  drives. pata drives have wide  flat cables or thick cables as wide as your finger  while sata drives have thin cables about the diameter of a pencil. you will need to know whether to buy an ide or sata drive  and you should be able to tell by looking at the cables. also note that some cables only offer a connector from one hard drive to the motherboard  while others have connectors for two or more.   now that you have confirmed that there is space to install a new drive in your machine and you know what type of drive you need  pata or sata   you can buy a new drive.    you can buy a new hard drive from many different places  a retail store  a large computer store  a local computer parts store or by mail order. wherever you go to buy it buy it  keep three things in mind    buy a  normal  3.5 inch wide hard drive. they re sold everywhere  but you want to avoid the smaller hard disk drives made for laptops. make sure the new drive has the correct cable system  sata or pata  to match your machine.    buy the biggest drive you can afford  because it will probably fill up before you know it.   nan    before we start working with the drive  we need to talk about static electricity. your computer is highly sensitive to static shocks. this means that if you build up static electricity on your body and a shock passes from your body to something like a hard drive  that hardware will probably fail and you will have to buy another one.    the way to eliminate static electricity is by grounding yourself. there are lots of ways to do this  but probably the easiest way is to wear a grounding bracelet on your wrist. then you connect the bracelet to something grounded  like a copper pipe or the center screw on a wall outlet s face plate . by connecting yourself to ground  you eliminate the possibility of static shock. you can get a bracelet for a few dollars. an alternative is to touch the power supply whenever you make a  big  motion  like taking off a jacket or getting up and sitting down again. a bracelet is superior in any case.    let s talk about this in more detail  because most people have ide drives.   in the ide system  most motherboards allow you to have two ide cables. each cable can connect to two drives. usually you use one cable to connect one or two optical drives to your machine. the other cable is used to connect one or two hard drives to your machine. you want both hard drives to be on the same cable. the two drives on the cable are called  master  and  slave.  you want your existing hard drive  which contains the operating system and all of your current data  to be the  master  and the new hard drive to be the  slave.  the drive should have instructions on them that tell you how to set the jumpers for master and slave. so read the instructions and set the jumpers. if you are using sata drives  you do not need to set jumpers for master and slave because each drive gets its own cable. check out how ide controllers work to learn more about the master and slave configuration. avoid using a large tool to remove the jumpers  as this can knock the pins out of alignment.    if it fits  then it s a match. connect the ide or sata cable to the drive.    to do this  click the start button  open the control panel  switch to classic view  click on administrative tools  click on computer management  click on disk management.   look at the graphical area in the bottom right of this display. disk 0 is your original hard drive. disk 1 is the new hard drive. chances are that the new drive will not be initialized  or formatted. click the small button to initialize the drive  and then format it as an ntfs volume  right click on the new drive  then click  format...  . formatting may take an hour or more  so be patient. when the formatting is done  you are ready to use your new drive.  
query	198	hear baby s heartbeat heart rate monitor monitor fetal heart rate  the best way to know the fetus  heart rate is to have a medical professional perform an external examination. the doctor or technician will be able to locate the fetus using sophisticated equipment.your doctor may not be able to pick up on the fetal heart rate until between ten and fourteen weeks of development. whoever performs the test will need to lift up your shirt or gown to reach your bare belly.    the doctor may use a fetoscope  which is similar to a stethoscope. they will press one end of it to your stomach to listen for the fetus  heartbeat. wait patiently as they do this.  a doppler device will let you hear the baby s heartbeat on an electronic monitor while measuring the heart rate. the technician will apply gel to your stomach before pressing a wand called a transducer to your skin.dopplers are typically used at the same time as ultrasounds.    fetal heart rate alone cannot tell you if there is a problem or not. if the heart rate is abnormal  a doctor may do other tests to make sure that the fetus is in good health. follow your doctor s guidance and advice.  if your pregnancy is going relatively smoothly  you may only need intermittent monitoring during labor. this means that a nurse will check the heartbeat every fifteen to thirty minutes with a doppler device or fetoscope.  if the doctor suspects there is a problem  they may perform continuous monitoring. in this case  a doppler device will be attached to your stomach with a belt. this will monitor the baby s heartbeat constantly throughout labor.this method may be used if you have taken an epidural or oxytocin. it may also be used if there are complications with the pregnancy.    in some extreme cases  your doctor may need to insert a special wire into your cervix. this wire will attach to the fetus  head. the doctor will get a more accurate measure of the baby s heart rate.before this procedure  your doctor or nurse may do a vaginal exam first. they will then insert a catheter so that they can attach a wire to the baby. this can also help track the baby s movements. this is a more invasive procedure that can only be done after your water has broken. it is typically only done if the doctor cannot find the baby s heart using an external monitor or if there are severe complications.    if the doctor determines that there may be complications  follow their instructions. they may recommend further procedures to check on the health of the baby during labor.  in the united states  you must have a prescription from a doctor to buy a doppler fetal heart monitor. ask your doctor if this device is right for you. you may even ask them to demonstrate how to use it.while there are no known problems with using doppler devices at home  it is best to have these tests done by a medical professional. even with a device  you may not be able to recognize problems with the baby s heartbeat without medical training.while a doctor may be able to detect the heart rate as early as ten weeks  at home doppler devices may not work until five months.  lift up your shirt to reveal your bare belly. squeeze ultrasound gel onto your stomach along your pubic bone or lower abdomen. use the wand of the doppler device  called a transducer probe  to spread the gel over your skin.ultrasound gel often comes with the device  although you may be able to purchase it separately.    you can guide the transducer probe around your pubic bone area. if you re having difficulty finding the fetus  hold the wand at different angles. the fetus  heartbeat will sound like a strong  consistent pulse.do not use the device for longer than ten minutes at a time. if you cannot find the heartbeat in that time  try again in a few days. it may be difficult to find the heartbeat using at home devices. visit a doctor for an external examination if you are concerned.    once you locate the heartbeat  the heart rate will appear on the electronic monitor of the device. the baby s heart rate should be between 110 and 160 beats per minute  bpm . the heart rate can vary between 5 and 25 beats from minute to minute.if the fetus  heart rate is between 160 and 180 bpm  they may have fetal tachycardia. visit a doctor.if the heart rate is between 60 and 100 bpm  you may have actually picked up on your own heart rate instead of the fetus .the fetal heart rate is not an accurate measure of health. complications can still happen  even if the heartbeat is normal. do not delay getting medical attention if you suspect something is wrong.  if you are concerned that there is a problem  visit a doctor immediately. the doctor can perform more tests to determine if there is an issue.if you have any abdominal pain  bleeding  dizziness  cramping  or discharge  see a doctor immediately  even if the fetus  heart rate is normal. if you notice any change in the baby s heart rate or if you notice an irregular pulse  call your doctor.

lot.    go to a party store and ask if they have red carpet props. if they don t  ask if they know where to get one.   if you cannot find a pre made red carpet anywhere  make one out of fabric. simply purchase red fabric and have the fabric store cut it to the length you need. alternatively  visit a local thrift store and have a rummage. you might be lucky and find red fabric  a red sheet or even a red rug that you can transform. even a few old white sheets can work  just dye them red and lay them down to serve as the red carpet.    stretch out the carpet as long as possible so that your guests can do many poses as they walk down. if possible  have the red carpet leading up to the room where the award show will be in.   arrange it so that you come down the carpet last. if you can  have someone videotaping or taking pictures.    this is where people will accept awards  sit around to eat the party food and where you can play party games. hang gold balloons up  throw around fancy streamers and make the room appear as glamorous as possible. use chic tablecloths and elegant centerpieces for tables in the room.    aim for chic and cute food  and plenty of it. everyone may be

the guests rsvp  have them tell you what song they will dance to or what song they will sing to. a good place to get your music is aol music  http   www.aolmusic.com   because all the music is completely free and you don t need an account. if you will not be able to access the music in the awards room  then ask them to provide the music unless you have the cd that the music is on. if you don t have the music and your guest doesn t  then they will have to probably change the song unless you or the guest can somehow get a hold of it before the party. if someone is going to dance  make sure there is a clear space for them. you might have to go outside if they need a big space. try to tape the performances so that everyone can watch them at the vip party.    this is a very important part of the party because this is what the guests have been invited to. think of a name for your show. you can use the original names  such as grammies  oscars  academy awards  golden globes  etc. or you can make up your own names  anything you want.   ask your parent and or siblings for name ideas. for the award prizes or trophies  buy little statues from a party store or a catalog if you don t want statues  you can make certificates. you could even spray paint old dolls to make them look like oscar statuettes. look in thrift stores for unwanted dolls.    the vip party is the really fun part of the party. here you will dance  watch movies  talk  stay up all night  etc. if you taped the main part of the party  you can watch that. or  watch a movie  or do both. a great party always includes

query	200	build hybrid vehicle use hybrid cars efficiently  the best way to use your hybrid car efficiently is to not use it at all. walk or bike to your destinations when possible. you could also use public transport  such as buses  trains  and subways. alternately  grab a ride with a friend and carpool to your destinations.    most hybrid drivers say that to maximize their hybrid s possibilities for efficiency  they must re learn how to drive.while things like watching their speedometer and using cruise control are not foreign to the experience of driving a regular car  they become crucial aspects of driving a hybrid.   keep an eye on the dashboard fuel economy display  if present.this display will give you a real time update about your fuel efficiency. incorporate driving styles that are fuel efficient into your regular driving behavior. use your brakes. hybrids employ a technology known as regenerative braking. this means that the energy produced by the brakes    wasted as heat in normal cars    is used to recharge the battery of your hybrid.apply gentle  even pressure to the brakes and gently glide to a stop. don t brake too soon. give yourself enough distance and space to effectively brake.    hov lanes are designed to reduce traffic during rush hour and peak travel times by vehicles with two or more people. certain states also allow hybrid cars to make use of hov lanes even if they contain only one passenger.   california  for instance  permits hybrid car drivers to use the hov lane if they have a clean air vehicle sticker and their car is on the approved list. see http   www.arb.ca.gov msprog carpool carpool.htm for more information. virginia offers a similar program.check their list of approved hybrid vehicles at http   www.dmv.virginia.gov vehicles  cleanspecialfuel.asp to discover whether your hybrid can be used in hov lanes. however  you will not be able to drive the car in hov lanes on i 95 or i 494 with less than three passengers.    your hybrid car s fuel efficiency will decline when you drive over 55 miles per hour. if you drive with the cruise control set to 70 miles per hour or more  turn it off  especially on an incline. try to aim for a top highway speed of around 60 miles per hour.don t be afraid to ride in the slow lane. let other cars pass you. use moderate acceleration.accelerating too quickly will cause both the gas and electric engines to operate in tandem. when heading up a hill  try find that goldilocks zone with your hybrid car    an acceleration level that is neither too slow nor too fast. drifting in either direction will cause your mileage and fuel efficiency to decline.    monitor fuel efficiency while you use each. for instance  try accelerating slowly for a few weeks  then try accelerating a bit faster  and then try accelerating more quickly. compare the mileage results of the different techniques and adopt the most fuel efficient one.   after reaching your desired speed  coast as long as possible until you need to stop or turn. be mindful of how you start your vehicle at stoplights. your hybrid is programmed to turn off the engine when in park or when you re not moving.it will turn on again when you resume motion. use your foot to gently apply pressure to the gas pedal to start the car in motion.    with the cruise control on  you re less likely to rev the engine and accelerate quickly  which can cause the gas engine to kick in to provide the extra push that rapid acceleration requires. lay off the gas and set your cruise control to your desired speed whether you re on the highway or on a street.if you don t have cruise control  try to keep your speed constant. not only does accelerating your vehicle use energy  slowing it wastes your energy as well. a constant speed is the most energy efficient for your vehicle.    if your battery is fully charged  it will more quickly wear out. similarly  if your battery is totally or nearly depleted  it will have an adverse affect on the total number of charges you ll be able to get out of it.keep an eye on your battery s gauge. when you ve charged it to an upper mid range value  around 80   end the recharging process. don t let the battery s power drop beyond 20 .   some hybrid manufacturers have factored this fact into their design  and have safeguards in place from preventing a battery from actually reaching a totally full or totally empty state. consult your user manual for specifics about how to manage your battery s charge levels.    keeping your battery warm really means keeping your car warm. if a battery gets cold  the amount of energy you can get out of it decreases.during winter  keep your hybrid in the garage to spare it from the worst of the cold weather.   turn on your car and let it sit idle for a bit in order to get the battery warmed. excessive heat can be bad for your battery  too. a battery at ninety two degrees fahrenheit will only last five years. keep your car in the garage and out of direct sunlight.    your hybrid might offer the option of choosing when to switch from the battery to the gasoline engine. when possible  use the battery  since you will save money on gasoline. in some cases  such as highway driving  hybrids will generally switch over to the gasoline engine automatically.   drive within your vehicle s battery range. most hybrids allow between 10 and 35 miles of driving exclusively on the electric battery before they need to transition to a gasoline engine.keep your drives short and at a close distance from your home. stay close to home with your hybrid to maximize its efficiency.    figure out if you want a full hybrid  an assist  a plugin  or a mild hybrid. weigh the pros and cons of each before making a purchase decision.   one design option you need to choose is whether to get a parallel or a series hybrid. a parallel hybrid is one in which both electric and gas engine can be used in tandem. most hybrids are of this type. some  however  are of the series type  in which only the gas or only the battery can operate at any given time.full hybrids can run on electricity alone. mild hybrids are those in which the gas engine is on all the time  and the electric battery only provides an extra boost. plugin hybrids can be plugged into the wall at your home or  if facilities exist  your workplace  but the gas engine will not recharge the batteries as in a non plugin hybrid. the decision you make about what kind of hybrid you want comes down to your motivations and your budget. if you re an eco warrior  you might want to choose a full or parallel hybrid. if you make a lot of long trips but still want to improve your gas mileage  a series or mild hybrid might be for you. always purchase a car within your price range.    many employers offer financing and rebates for employees who want to purchase a hybrid car.hyperion  for instance  offers  5 000 for employees who wish to purchase a hybrid. the company commits  1 million each year toward its hybrid incentive program. google  likewise offers  5 000 for employees that purchase  fuel efficient  vehicles  which means many hybrids qualify for this rebate. they also offer

query	204	drive lincoln town car choose the right car for you  this section details each question.    according to car experts  considering what you like and dislike can help to narrow down your choices. for instance  if you like sports car  then look for sports car. there s no need to waste your time and energy searching for suv s  etc.    in the car. if you like a sports car but this sports car will not fit your needs  scratch the sports car. if you are planning on building a big family  opt for bigger cars unless of course if you have the money to afford to buy many cars  then it would be fine.   if you are a construction worker and need space to transport logs and huge pieces of wood and stuff  then a pickup truck will be right for you.    this is especially important for those who have a big family who have kids with them on car seats. more space is needed if you are carrying your whole family with you so a car with more space inside is preferable.   if only you are going to drive that car  and you are not going to transport more than one person somewhere  a two seater should be fine. consider  however  that a smallish back seat adds little or nothing to the cost and fuel consumption of the car  allows the passenger seat to recline more  and greatly increases cargo capacity  sometimes with the seats dropping and connecting to the trunk . a two seater is more for extreme compactness  style and handling than lack of need of a rear seat. if you usually transport 3 4 people but don t need that much trunk space  a compact to mid size should be fine. if you usually transport around 4 people and need lots of trunk space  then you should get a full size sedan  a minivan  or an suv. a minivan is roomiest of these and more efficient than the suv  some have a stretched nose to look less minivan like. a full size sedan is most comfortable  particularly a factory stretched long wheelbase version such as a lincoln town car executive l or signature l  and often designed for strenuous limousine service. an suv often has four wheel drive and is good  at low speed  for poor road conditions. if you have a large family and or regularly transport about 5 6 people  get a van or minivan. a minivan can be safer in that it has a low center of gravity almost like a car.    before going to the showrooms for test drives and car checks  have a primary budget in mind. this will help you to remain reasonable about the choices and not give in to a car you really cannot afford. if you re on a suzuki or hyundai budget  it ll help you not to tiptoe toward an audi or mercedes.    if you need a fuel efficient car  a hybrid will be right for you. you ll want to consider however whether it is worth it or not. if you have a commute longer than thirty miles to work daily  or if you spend a great deal of a short commute in traffic every morning  then hybrids are a great option versus economy sized four cylinder cars. extra cylinders and displacement greatly decrease fuel economy overall  and extra frontal area greatly decreases fuel economy at speed. a long  low car such as a big sedan or wagon with a relatively small  cheap engine can be stylish  comfortable and safe.   for a personal  urban car  petrol or gas is best over diesel.    this can be directed by your budget and also your common sense. in some cases  used cars offer better value but they do require careful checking by an expert  especially to certify that the car hasn t experienced an accident  or has been properly repaired if it has been in one.    checking a relevant local car review website  or several  will give you the lowdown on the features  appearance  performance stats and other vital information. you ll be able to see what other people and experts have been thinking about the cars in question and also see what potential issues there might be.   reviews from owners are more realistic and honest than those from the salesroom are likely to be. you ll learn the disadvantages as much as the advantages.    if the car has only just been released  avoid being an early adopter. wait for a few months or so to see what happens to its on road value and to read reviews from the owners.    add in the information gleaned from the website searches too. you will be able to see  at a glance  what the benefits and drawbacks of each car type is.    they ll have their own ideas and preferences to take into account too  especially if the car is to be shared and driven by more than just you.

query	206	get a large jar marmite eat marmite  in britain and other places where marmite is popular  it s often eaten as a spread on toast  crackers  and other baked bread products. since marmite has such a strong salty  yeasty taste  it s usually eaten in small quantities even by its fans. if you re using your marmite as a spread  rather than using a full spoonful of it like you might for jam or peanut butter  instead  use a tiny pea sized amount  like you would for toothpaste .   ideally  when you spread this tiny amount of marmite on your bread  it should leave a paper thin layer of marmite   just enough to discolor the bread. you don t want any noticeable  thickness  to the marmite  as this will give a seriously overpowering taste.    one of the most common ingredients to combine with marmite is butter  especially when the marmite is being used as a spread. butter s rich  smooth taste pairs well with the strong  salty flavor of marmite. if you hate marmite  try applying a generous helping of butter to your bread before or after you spread on the marmite   the more you use  the less you ll taste the marmite.to many  this makes marmite much more palatable.    getting used to eating marmite is like the old saying about how to boil a frog   if you drop a frog into a pot of hot water  it will jump out  but if you drop it into a pot of lukewarm water and slowly increase the heat  it won t know anything s wrong until it s too late rather than trying to wolf down your marmite in a few huge bites  instead  take small nibbles to begin. gradually  as you make progress  the strong  salty taste should become more bearable.   if you re having a hard time swallowing even small bites of your marmite spread  try moving each bite carefully to the back of your mouth so that you can swallow it without much chewing. this should minimize the amount you have to taste the marmite  but be careful   you ll need to take small bites to be able to swallow them without choking.    to keep the overpowering taste of marmite under control  try taking a drink after each bite of marmite you take. the drink will act as a chaser   the more you sip  the less you ll taste the marmite and the quicker the taste will leave your mouth.   plain  ordinary tap water is a good zero calorie chaser  but if you really hate the taste of marmite  you may want to consider a stronger tasting beverage. after each bite  try drinking a swig of your favorite soft drink  or  if you re old enough  a stiff cocktail. the strong flavors of these beverages should help  drown out  the marmite taste.    the senses of taste and smell closely interact with each other to produce the  effect  that you experience when eating food. the way something smells can affect the way it tastes to you  and vice versa .if you hate the taste of marmite  there s a very good chance you won t care for its smell  either. in this case  try your hardest not to smell the marmite as you eat it. usually  the taste  though still strong  will be a little less intense if you make an effort to hold your breath until the marmite has been swallowed  or nearly so .    perhaps the single easiest way to make marmite more manageable is to simply not make it the central feature of your dish. pairing marmite with other foods  especially ones with distinctive  powerful flavors of their own  can make it much more palatable. though you may never enjoy marmite by itself  you may even find that you enjoy it when paired with other foods or used as a minor ingredient in a large recipe    there s no  wrong  way to eat marmite   any food you enjoy it with is fair game. just a few foods that some marmite fans enjoy pairing their favorite yeasty spread with are eggs  cheese  meat  seafood  apricots  marmalade  and more in the next section  we ll explore a few more flavorful marmite combinations. feel free to use any of them as you see fit  or make your own     in small quantities  marmite can give soups  stews  and other hearty liquid dishes a rich  savory flavor  and also works great as a browning agent . for instance  try mixing a spoonful of marmite into a pot of french onion soup in place of beef stock   the flavor of the finished soup goes great with bread and cheese  just like ordinary marmite.in general  you can usually get away with substituting marmite mixed with water  your favorite vegetables  and a little oil for beef broth. this can allow you to make great tasting vegetarian versions of all your favorite carnivorous soups and stews.  many marmite fans agree  the spread pairs deliciously with a wide variety of cheeses. sharp cheddar is an especially great choice   the salty  yeasty flavor of the marmite enhances the  sharpness  of the cheese  making for a bold flavored  but tasty  combination. try adding a few slices of cheese to standard marmite and butter toast for a satisfying breakfast.  though it may sound odd  marmite can be a tasty ingredient to include in glazes and sauces for meat dishes. used correctly  marmite can give the outer  crust  of roasted meats  poultry  and seafood a rich  distinct  umami   savory  flavor. try painting a light mixture of melted butter and marmite over a whole roasted chicken for a savory treat   you should only need a spoonful or two to cover it.   if you use marmite as a meat glaze  you may want to forego sprinkling salt from the salt shaker on your meat  especially if you need to be careful about your sodium intake. marmite has a very high salt content   it s more than 10  salt by mass   believe it or not  some people not only eat their spaghetti with marmite   they love it. if you re willing to experiment  try adding a half teaspoon of marmite to al dente noodles along with a small helping of olive oil  you may want to avoid using fine tomato sauces or cheeses to top your dish until you re positive that you enjoy it    note that some fans of this recipe describe the flavor as being similar to the british snack food  twiglets .  if you ve recently gained an appreciation for marmite and you re looking to expand your repertoire  try this marmite centered sampler dish  which works as a hearty meal on its own and scales easily for larger groups. start by boiling a few eggs in a pot of water until they re hard boiled. depending on the size of the eggs  this should take about eight to ten minutes.   run cold water over the eggs after they re done cooking. cooling them down halts the cooking process and prevents them from overcooking.  next  let s get our vegetables ready for the marmite. wash a bell pepper  a handful of cherry tomatoes  a cucumber  a carrot  and a few clumps of broccoli under running water. cut each into small bite size pieces. any shapes that look appealing are fine  but  for efficiency s sake  you ll probably want to julienne your bell pepper  cut it into skinny strips  and take thin circular slices from your cucumber.    finally  make a few golden brown slices of marmite s most well known companion dish. you can use white  wheat  or even specialty breads like sourdough and rye here   it s up to you  when the toast is ready  butter it. as noted above  butter and marmite pair quite well together.    arrange your vegetables  eggs  and toast in a circle around the outside of a large plate. open a jar of marmite and place it in the center of the dish.   don t forget to peel your hard boiled eggs. if you d like to use them to hold marmite like crackers  cut the eggs into quarters or eights to make skinny  curved slices.    using a butter knife  put small portions of marmite on each piece of vegetable or egg before biting in. you can eat the toast without marmite as a  chaser  to ready your mouth for the next bit piece of marmite  or  if you re bold  just spread a tiny dollop of marmite on each piece of bread.   if you want to  you can even dip your foods directly into the jar of marmite. be careful   it s easy to get more marmite than you intended this way   
query	207	make mentos react with coke mentos make a diet coke and mentos rocket  for the purposes of this example  we re using diet coke  but you can actually use any type of diet soda  as long as it contains aspartame .   warm soda causes better explosions  so avoid using cold refrigerated soda.for best results  purchase room temperature soda and then let it sit outside in the sun or in a pot full of hot  not boiling  water for a few hours before using it.    experiments have shown that while the original mint mentos will give you a longer explosion  mentos fruit will give you slightly shorter but more intense explosion.other experiments have shown that mint mentos are the better choice because the gum arabic found in the mint coating reduces surface tension and quickens the carbon dioxide s escape from the bottle  making for a more intense explosion.as the rocket is more of a fast acting affair  you might want to go for mint mentos. if you have the time and money to do so  why not try one bottle with mint mentos and one with fruit mentos  and then compare the results     you probably have this one lying around your house already  but if you don t  you should be able to buy a roll just about anywhere  hardware stores are a safe bet .    wearing goggles will not only protect your eyes from the soda mentos concoction  but also from any other debris  for example  the lid  that might fly out from the bottle once it hits the ground and explodes.    your rocket is likely to bounce around like crazy  make sure it has enough room to do that. if you re in a parking lot  make sure there are no cars nearby for at least a 50 foot radius  if not more.   if there s a field or empty lot nearby  go there to make your rocket. you don t want to risk doing damage to anyone s car or home  as it could cost you or your parents a lot of money to repair.    it s possible you ll get covered in the sticky diet coke mentos solution. wear clothes and shoes that you don t mind getting wet and sticky   preferably ones that are easy to wash.    bring your 2 liter bottle of diet coke  your pack of mentos  your masking tape  and your safety goggles to wherever you ve decided to build your rocket.    place the strips of tape on a flat surface  with their sticky sides facing up. do not allow them to stick together.    the more mentos you use  the better the explosion  however  you don t want to the mentos to dip too far into the diet coke otherwise the explosion may begin before you can screw the lid on the bottle.    they should look just as they did when they were still in their original packaging  stacked on top of one another like a roll of coins.    be sure to leave the sides of the mentos exposed.    you ll use this piece to attach the mentos to the bottle cap  so ensure that it s small enough to fit inside the cap.    take the 3 inch strip of sticky rolled tape that you ve just created and attach it to the top of the taped roll of mentos. this will create a  loaded  mentos cartridge that you can place inside the diet coke bottle.    put the cap on a flat surface  with its inside facing upwards. place the mentos cartridge  sticky tape side up  into the soda cap and press down to fasten it there.   be careful not to press too hard  as you don t want any mentos falling out of the cartridge     this step is optional. if you re worried about the mentos prematurely falling into the diet coke  you can secure the cartridge by running one more piece of masking tape around the entire roll  including the cap.    the cap should be securely on the bottle  but not closed too tightly. if it s closed too tightly  the cap might not come off when you throw the bottle  and the rocket won t work. as you twist the cap on  you ll also want to make sure that the mentos do not touch the diet coke yet.  if it seems like the mentos will touch the diet coke  you can either dump a small amount of diet coke out before screwing the cap on  redo your mentos cartridge to contain fewer mentos  or you can try your luck and screw the cap on as quickly as possible.    shake it so that the mentos fall into the diet coke  and then keep shaking. do this for at least a few seconds.    there are several different methods for  launching  your rocket    a popular and effective one is to throw the bottle high up into the air and let it fall on to the ground  preferably hard ground  like cement . this is the best method if you re worried about getting hit by the rocket  as you can throw it far away from you and even run in the opposite direction. another method is to throw the bottle at a side angle so that when it hits the ground  the ground knocks off its cap. yet another method is to throw the bottle at more of a 90 degree angle  cap first  on to the ground.    you can skip this step if your rocket works right away. if the rocket doesn t go off when you throw it  pick it up and try unscrewing the cap a little before throwing it again. just be careful not to unscrew the cap too far  otherwise you re likely to end up covered in diet coke.  when the bottle hits the ground  its cap should fly off and the diet coke mentos solution will shoot out of the bottle s opening. this should cause the bottle to fly high up into the air. depending on how you throw it  the bottle might also bounce around sporadically for several seconds.   side angle launches generally seem to cause the bottle to bounce low and skid along the ground. vertical launches  in which you throw the bottle straight up into the air and let it fall to the ground  tend to give the rocket more height as it shoots upward. if the bottle is still full of diet coke and mentos but it s stopped moving on the ground  you can try to launch it again to see if it has any more flight left in it.    once you ve finished your experiment  don t forget to pick up after yourself. clean up any bits of tape or mentos packaging that might have dropped to the ground as you built your rocket. and pick up the rocket  clean out the bottle and put it in the recycling bin  or bring it to the bottle depot .    the more mentos  the better the explosion. experiment with putting different amounts

watch  usually made of a precious metal and the watch movement is the inside of the watch  and contains all the pieces that make it tick. there are three main types of antique pocket watches called the open face  hunter case  and the demi hunter or half hunter case.open face watches do not have a metal cover  while hunter face watches do. demi hunter cases have a cover with a small see through window so you can still read the time.  there are two main types of movements in most pocket watches and include quartz movements which are battery powered and only last a couple of years  and a mechanical movement which is in most traditional antique pocket watches today.quartz watches keep more accurate time  but are less sought after as collectibles.mechanical movements require upkeep  so if your watch breaks  it may be expensive to repair.    many watch sellers can be flexible with the prices on their antique pocket watches. make sure to haggle with the person selling it. try to get them to reduce the price by telling them that you can t spend that much  or that this is your first time and you want to start a collection on limited funds. make sure to look up the value of similar watches online  so you have a rough idea of how much the watch might cost. if you are buying a watch on an online auction  wait for a time where there isn t many people bidding  and avoid bidding wars.   the more you save  the more you can invest in your next antique pocket watch. professional pocket watch sellers will probably be a little less flexible with their pricing. haggle if you are buying one at an antique shop or outdoor market.    ideally  you want to store each pocket watch in its own individual bag in a secured place where it s not going to fall or have anything damage it. storing other items in the bags can scratch the pocket watch and hurt its value. some plastics contain chemicals which corrode metal and other material over time  so avoid using plastic bags.don t store your antiques in damp or humid places because the moisture could damage the internal parts of the watch. if the watch has a face  make sure to close it when you store it. place the watch face up.    in many cases the cost of repairing a watch is more than the cost of the watch itself. examine the outside of the watch to see if there are any rough abrasions or scratches. damage on the outside indicates potential damage with internal components. take out the watch movement and and look for any missing springs or screws which would indicate that it hasn t been repaired in a long time. try winding and setting the watch. the dials should turn smoothly and not jerk while you are turning them. if you hear grinding  there is probably an issue with the internal components. if the watch is fully wound but not running  then something is broken on the watch and it needs to be repaired.avoid rust at all costs because it indicates that the inside parts may be rusted as well.    avoid abrasive or acidic cleaners that may destroy the quality of your watch. using metal polishers and cleaners that are made specifically for the type of metal that your watch is made of. remember to use a lint free cloth  and don t get your pocket watch wet.   if you use a glass cleaner for the face of your watch  make sure it is alcohol and ammonia free. if you never clean your pocket watch

query	212	install replacement window install replacement windows  this choice should be made based on the styling of your home  as well as your budget. the four common frame types are  wood  vinyl or metal clad wood  and all vinyl or all wood.   wood frames  if the exterior of your home features natural wood siding  a wood frame will complement your home nicely. wood frames are generally more expensive  but they do offer a low heat transfer and can be very energy efficient. if you re looking for low maintenance  however  they don t exactly fit the bill. they must be properly primed and painted  as well as repainted every few years to maintain their appeal. vinyl metal clad window frames  many replacement window manufacturers offer a wood frame window with a metal or vinyl  wrapping  on the exterior of the window. as long as the  wrapping  is sealed  the window is relatively maintenance free. you can also choose a color that complements the exterior of your home  without having to repaint every few years.  keep in mind that although the window unit is maintenance free  you will still have to either paint the exterior trim to match the window wrapping or replace the trim with a vinyl product like azek.   metal window frames  if you re looking for low maintenance as well as low cost  a metal frame might be a good choice. metal windows and siding are less stylish than they used to be  but that doesn t mean that you can t make them look good in your home. vinyl frames  vinyl replacement windows are extremely popular because they are easy to install  cost effective  and energy efficient.         some people take the height measurement from the top of the sill. this leaves room to attach a  header expander  to the top of the new window. others  though  dislike using header expanders because they decrease effective window size  and complicate the trim process.    since the new unit will need to be installed at least close to plumb  adjust your measurements accordingly. this will ensure that you have the largest size window that can be installed plumb  and level in the opening provided.    this is due to the fact that replacement windows are made to order in increments of 1 4.     this will keep the paint from chipping or peeling away from the casing when you remove the stops. this will also make removing the window stops easier  paint is a surprisingly good adhesive.   use a thin flat bar or even a putty knife to separate stubborn joints. this will minimize denting or marring other parts of the window trim.    using a hinging motion  swing the top of the window into the room until it is horizontal. then  twist the window into the opening by lifting up one side and pressing down on the other until the window is free.   every window is different some might take a little muscle to remove. don t worry about scratching the inside of the jambs while removing the window  it ll get covered anyway. if the window is cracked or particularly stubborn  wear gloves and eye protection in case it shatters while removing it.    if the original window was an older  weighted window  there may be pulleys at the top of the jamb that need to be removed. clear any dust from the bottom corners of the frame to ensure a good bond with the sealant.    if there were weights  remove the pulleys and apply a small amount of caulk to any holes.    sill flashing for a vinyl window is an  l  shaped piece of vinyl that is the same width as the replacement window unit. the vertical part of the  l  shape is slotted  allowing it to clip onto the bottom  outer edge of the window unit and shed water away from the bottom of the window.    mark both sides where it hits the exterior window stops. remove the lower part of the  l  shape on both sides as marked to allow the sill flashing to fit into place. once trimmed  lay the sill flashing back in place and trace the outside edge with a pencil.    make sure you get both sides and the top. then  apply a 1 4  bead directly to the wood sill on the inside of your pencil line.   nan  the bottom should be angled away and in to the opening. once the bottom of the unit has cleared the sill and is against the exterior stops  press down on the window and swing the top into the frame.   press the window firmly and evenly against the stops to ensure a good seal.     these are usually located about four inches from the top and bottom on both sides.    be sure the window is centered in the window opening.  keep in mind that vinyl is much softer  and more flexible than wood. over tightening the screws can damage the frame of the window.     leave about a 1 4  gap along the bottom. this gap should be parallel to the windowsill.   if the gap is larger on the right side  loosen the top right screw and tighten the top left screw or loosen the bottom left screw and tighten the bottom right screw. if the gap is larger on the left side  loosen the top left screw and tighten the top right screw or loosen the bottom right screw and tighten the bottom left screw.    if necessary  apply a thin bead around the perimeter to eliminate any voids  and leave a smooth  weather tight seal.

query	214	recharge automotive battery buy rv batteries  the chassis battery in your rv serves the same purpose as the automotive battery in any vehicle. these batteries can be purchased at your local auto parts stores and usually cost between  50 and  300  depending on the type of battery you choose and the brand. ask the clerk at the front desk to look up your rv in their system to offer you suggestions about the battery options you have.some large retailers also have automotive sections you can purchase chassis batteries in. make sure to tell the clerk what vehicle you intend to put the battery in  as that s important to ensure it will fit in the engine bay and provide the necessary power.    a chassis battery is sometimes referred to as a  starter battery  in rvs. this battery is used primarily to start the engine that propels the rv when you re driving and serves the same purpose as the battery in your car or truck. like cars and trucks  any modifications you ve made to the electrical system of the vehicle may require further consideration when choosing a new battery.determine if you have made any modifications that may result in an increased draw from the battery when starting.    just like cars and trucks  rvs come with an owner s manual that can provide specifications about what type of battery you should choose as your chassis battery. it s important to look for a battery that matches the specifications laid out in the owner s manual to ensure you purchase a battery with the proper amount of cranking amperage  or the correct amount of initial power output  to start your rvs engine.if you do not have the owner s manual for your rv  try looking on the rv manufacturer s website. rv specialty stores can often look up the proper type of battery for your rv. understand that this battery is primarily used to power the starter motor  and likely won t be involved in powering any of the electrical devices in the rv.    wet or flooded cell batteries are the most common types of automotive batteries. the vehicle you drive every day likely came with a wet cell battery. these batteries offer the lowest relative cost and are sometimes even sealed  meaning they require no maintenance beyond regular charging to maintain.a traditional wet cell battery is likely what your rv came with from the factory. some wet cell batteries are not sealed and require service from time to time to maintain. wet cell batteries offer low cost and reliability.    valve regulated lead acid batteries  or vrla batteries  are named as such because of the internal safety valves built into the battery. these batteries come in two primary types  gel and agm  absorbed gas mat . these batteries can be more reliable than wet cell batteries because they are designed to prevent any fluid loss. these batteries do not require ventilation as some wet cell batteries may and also do not require any maintenance service.gel cell batteries maintain a charge well  but do not offer as powerful an initial or cranking amperage as their agm counterparts. agm batteries contain gas instead of gel  and can produce a higher cranking amperage.    while the amperage required of your battery is determined by the design of the engine  one thing you should look into when shopping for rv batteries is the maximum reserve capacity  rc . this rating is often not provided on the battery s label and you may need to ask for assistance at your local auto parts store to find the batteries with the highest rated reserves. a battery with a 120 minute reserve capacity means it can operate your electronics for that long without the engine running before being depleted.because you may want to use some of the electronics connected to the engine s electrical system while parked  a high reserve capacity is important. you can find batteries  maximum reserve capacity information on the battery maker s websites.    deep cycle batteries are used in a number of applications  so they are carried at most auto parts stores. you may want to shop for deep cycle batteries at specialty rv sales locations however  as their clerks will be more knowledgeable about what you need the batteries to be capable of in order to power the interior of your rv. ask the clerk at an rv specific retail location for help choosing the best battery for your needs.deep cycle batteries tend to be slightly more expensive than more common automotive batteries  but can still usually be found for  100 to  400. let the clerk at an rv specific retail location know about things that may affect battery life like large televisions or multiple computers that will need to be powered.    while the chassis or starter battery in your rv is designed to produce a brief but high output of energy to start the engine  deep cycle batteries are designed to produce lower  more consistent levels of output to power electronics and appliances within the rv. these batteries can be recharged more often and drained deeper than chassis batteries without compromising the life of the battery.these batteries power the lights  refrigerators  side motors  water heaters and any other mechanisms that require electricity in the living quarters of your rv. the batteries powering your living quarters must always produce 12 volt output.    deep cycle batteries in your rv must product 12 volts  but you don t necessarily have to use a single 12 volt battery. two six volt batteries can be strung together to create the same power output  but can allow for different storage options. storage space is always an important consideration in rvs  and the design of yours may allow for two small batteries more readily than a single large one.six volt batteries are often sold for golf carts. these batteries can be strung together to power the living quarters of your rv. string batteries together by connecting the negative terminal on one to the positive of the next with a wire  then connecting the open terminals on each battery to the vehicle.    deep cycle batteries are the best option for powering the living quarters of your rv  but they aren t the only one. marine batteries can also be used for this purpose. these batteries can serve as either chassis or living quarters batteries because they are designed to produce both high initial output and consistent long lasting output. they don t do either as well as batteries designed to do just one thing  but do both well enough for use.marine batteries are not as efficient as deep cycle batteries  but come at a significantly lower cost. you cannot deplete marine battery as deeply or as often as you can with deep cycle batteries.    deep cycle batteries are designed to tolerate being depleted and recharged often  but the way you choose to recharge your batteries may affect the type of battery you should choose. many people charge their deep cycle batteries by plugging them into an outlet at their house or a campground  but others opt to use things like solar panels. plugging your batteries into a power source is the fastest way to charge your batteries  but not all batteries tolerate being charged quickly as well.if you choose to plug your batteries in often to charge  you may want to use a wet cell or agm battery  as they tolerate fast charging the best. gel batteries will tolerate fast charging  but may not last as long. trickle chargers can deliver slow charges that are not as harsh on the battery.    just like with the chassis battery  there are two main options for battery type when powering the living quarters of your rv. wet cell batteries offer lower costs  but may occasionally require service to maintain. vrla batteries come in two forms  gel and agm and often cost more than traditional wet cell batteries.gel batteries last longer than wet cell batteries but don t tolerate fast charging as well. they are usually more expensive than wet cell batteries. agm batteries are the most expensive option  but last longer than gel batteries and put up with fast charging as well as wet cell batteries.    when you know exactly what type of battery you want  make sure to check the amp hour  ah  and reserve capacity  rc  ratings to help you choose a specific one. the ah rating is a measure of how many amps the battery you choose will deliver over a span of 20 hours. the rc rating is the length of time the battery you choose can sustain a load of 25 amps.the higher the ah rating  the more things your battery can power. the higher the rc rating  the longer the battery will last while doing so.    most modern wet cell batteries are sealed and considered  maintenance free   but ones that are not sealed will require occasional service. you can usually easily identify if your battery is sealed or not by looking for rectangular ports on the top of the battery. if there are ports  the battery can be opened and requires maintenance to continue working properly.if there are no ports  the battery is sealed and does not require service. never open the ports without first putting on the appropriate safety gear.    if your battery does require occasional service  you may need to add water to it from time to time to keep it functioning properly. batteries that are charged and depleted often or operating in high temperature areas will likely require service more often than those that are not. first  check the water levels in the battery  then add distilled water if it is required. never service your battery without first putting on eye protection and gloves as the fluid inside is corrosive.remember  many wet cell and all vrla batteries do not require you to add water at any time. always use distilled water when adding fluid to your battery.    keeping your batteries charged will help prolong their lifespan and ensure your rv works just the way you want it to when you take it out. some people choose to remove the batteries from their rvs while storing them  but that isn t necessary. plug your rv batteries into a battery maintainer or trickle charger with a storage setting. never plug any of your rvs batteries into a trickle charger that does not have a maintenance or storage setting  as you run the risk of overcharging them.your deep cycle and starter batteries can be stored and charged using the same methods. make sure the voltage output on the trickle charger or maintainer you choose matches the voltage of the battery or you risk damaging the battery.    after your battery has been plugged into a maintainer or charger for a week  check on it to ensure it isn t overcharging. if the battery is warm to the touch or requires fluid be added to it  the charger you chose is introducing too much electricity into the battery. slight overcharging can reduce the battery s lifespan  and significant overcharging can cook the battery s internals and prevent it from holding a charge at all.if the battery seems to be overcharging  disconnect it immediately. clerks at most auto parts stores can help you match a trickle charger to the battery you intend to charge.    some wet cell deep cycle batteries require equalizing if left for several months without charging. equalizing a deep cycle battery involves using a high voltage charger at a low current level to break the sulfate crystals off of the inner cells. doing so requires a special charger and should be done by professionals.most wet cell  deep cycle batteries do not require equalization. if you are unsure if yours does  check on the manufacturer s website. no vrla batteries require

out the other. this is how you want the holes to sit.    think of it as putting a handle on the lantern. you ll attach the  handle  to the lantern by feeding the rope through the holes in the sides of the lantern  and then tying knots.   start on the inside of the lantern and tie knots in the rope on the outside of the hole you ve fed it through. the length of your rope will depend on how low you want the lantern to hang  which will depend on where you want to hang it.    cut a hole in the center of the lid and then slide it down over the rope so that it sits near the top of the lantern  just inside of it.   to keep the lid from coming up too easily  you can place a couple of rubbery glue dots on the rope so that it holds on to the lid when the lid presses down on it. you do want the lid to be easily liftable as this is how you ll access the candle  so don t fasten it permanently to the lantern.    if you re going to use the lantern right away  you can already turn the tea light on.   note that in the image an actual tea light is shown  but using an actual tea light is not advisable as it presents a fire hazard.    if you do decide to use a real candle in this lantern  make sure that you don t hang it somewhere windy  if the lantern is tilted with a real candle inside it  it could easily catch on fire.    you can purchase most of these things from a dollar store and a craft store    pint sized clear mason jar s  with lid s   wide mouthed jars are recommended  polyester fiber fill  toy stuffing  moss  a variety pack in different colors would be ideal twine or hemp cord in a color  or colors  of your choosing electric tea light  must be electric  scissors fabric to cover jar lid  optional     this is not a project you want to do on carpet or a lacy tablecloth  as bits of moss will get everywhere and the polyester filling will pick up any crumbs  lint or other debris.    have a few clumps of polyester filling and moss in front of you  plus your open mason jar s   with the lid s  nearby. you ll also want to have your electric tea light ready.    to do this  simply grab some filling and place it inside your mason jar. the jar will need to be well packed with filling  but you ll need some space right in the middle to place your electric tea light.    the bottom of the mason jar will be the top of your lantern. to make sure it s well covered with moss  sprinkle some into the jar before adding your polyester filling.    decide on what moss  or combination of moss  you ll use inside the lantern  and then place it on the polyester filling. there are a couple of ways that you can do this    remove the polyester filling from the mason jar and roll it around in the moss  then add additional moss and hold it on to the filling as you lower the filling into the mason jar. from there  you can use your fingers to place any additional moss between the filling and wall of the jar  until you re happy with how it looks. keep the filling in the jar and  holding the jar on its side  use your fingers to gently place bits of moss between the filling and the wall of the jar  until you re happy with how it looks. note that you only need to place the moss on the outer layer of filling. you ll only be able to see the moss that shows through the glass walls of the mason jar  so don t worry about putting moss anywhere except for between the filling and the jar s walls.    avoid the temptation to completely cover the walls of your mason jar in moss. too much moss will block the light from the electric candle.   more moss may look nicer when the lights are on  but when the lights are off  the filling will simply look like a twinkling fairy light behind a lovely forest pattern.    use your fingers to carve out a core inside the lantern. this is where your tea light will sit. be sure to leave enough filling that it firmly holds the moss against the walls of the jar.   carving out a hole slightly larger than the tea light will work fine. it may take some experimentation to see what s perfect. after trying the lantern out  if you want the light to shine through more vibrantly  you can remove a bit more filling.    you ll want the  flame  to be facing the bottom of the jar  which will be the top of your lantern.   add a small amount of filling to the jar once the electric tea light is in. this will help hold it in place and keep it from jiggling around.    once you place the lid on the jar  turn it upside down so that the jar is sitting on its lid. everything should stay in place. if it doesn t  add more filling.   at this point you can also test the lantern by turning on the electric tea light and making any adjustments you want to make in order to get the look you desire.    once the lantern is done  wrap some twine around around the neck of the jar  just below the ridges that you screw the lid on to  and tie it in a bow.   if you don t like the way the lid looks bare  you can glue some fabric on the lid and wrap that in twine instead. it s recommended to use a neutral or earthy shade of twine to match the natural mossy colors of the lantern.    it s not much to look at in the day  but it s lovely in the dark. follow these instructions to switch the lantern on and off    stand it up  lid up   open the lid  remove the piece of filling that holds the electric tea light in place  switch on or off the tea light  then replace the filling and the lid.    you can use stencils or free style it   just make sure your designs are easy to cut out    you can also use stickers whose shapes you like  as long as don t mind throwing them away.    be sure to stick them to the outside of the jar.    ensure that you ve sprayed the jar evenly  and that you ve covered the designs that you ve stuck to the jar.    make sure it s completely dry before you move to the next step. it may take less than 10 minutes to dry  depending on the spray.   the drying time should be clearly stated on the back of the spray can. if you re unsure of whether the spray is dry  touch the glass. it should feel dry.    once the glass frosting spray is completely dry  you can remove the adhesive designs.   this will leave you with a frosted glass lantern with clear spots where the designs were.    to keep the candle stationary  you can nestle it into some sand  sea salt  or epsom salt.    if you want to hang your lantern  you ll need to add a handle. to make a handle    to determine the length you need  wrap a piece of strong wire around the mouth of the jar  just beneath the ridges where the lid would screw on. next  pull the wire upwards and loop it over the jar to the desired size of the handle that you want  then cut the wire. wrap one end of the wire around the jar s mouth  bend the wire up as if making a handle  and then secure the end of the wire to the start of the handle by bending it into a loop with pliers. bend the free end of the wire into a handle and then secure it to the wire that sits around the jar s mouth  on the other end of the jar  by using pliers to bend it into a loop around that wire.    you ll be making this lantern by drawing on a piece of card stock  poking holes in it  taping it into a tube  and placing it over a candle. before drawing on the card stock  decide on your lantern s size and  if necessary  cut the paper to size.   you may want to choose the size of your lantern based on the candle you plan to use. you can also choose the size of the lantern based on the card stock you have or where you want to use the lantern.    use a pencil to very lightly sketch in your desired design right at the center of the card stock. this will be the front of your lantern.   you don t have to limit yourself to the front of the lantern. you can also do a larger design that goes all the way around  or off to the side. it s up to you  it may be tempting to get ambitious with your design. just remember that the more holes you poke  the more time it ll take you to make your lantern  remember to sketch lightly so that it s easier to erase the pencil markings once you ve poked your holes.    try to keep the space between holes as even as possible. do this until the design is complete.   you ll want to place the card stock on a piece of styrofoam or foam board for this step  so that the thumb tack has a firm surface it can fully sink into. one to two millimeters between holes would work well  but it doesn t have to be exact   you can eye it     use a good  soft eraser to remove the pencil marks along your designs. a thick  soft white eraser will work well.   be sure to press gently as you erase the pencil marks  and do not hold the paper against a hard surface as you erase them  otherwise the holes you ve made may close up a bit. if the holes do close up a bit as you erase the pencil marks  it s not a big deal   just use a thumb tack to gently push them outward again.    to fasten the sides together  place double sided tape on the back of one side of the paper  and on the front of the other side so that when they overlap they re extra secure.   if you have a large candle  you can wrap the card stock around the candle to get the shape you want.    place a votive into a glass votive holder and light it  then place the cylinder over the lit votive. to reduce the fire hazard  you can use an electric candle.    to do this  fold the top of the bag over in a slow  circular motion  moving around the bag.    pull out the gussets  the folded in parts  on both sides of the bag and work the bone folder around the top fold until the fold is clean and the bag is flat  with the gussets out and flat too .  use a pencil to stencil in a design on the front of the bag  then cut out the shape with a craft knife. place a piece of cardboard inside the bag as you cut to protect the back of the bag.   if you don t want to make a design on the bag  you can move down to the step in which you add grommets to the sides of the bag.    place 1 grommet in the middle of each side of your bag  roughly 1 2 inch down from the top of the bag. to find the center  use the crease from the mid line of the gusset as your guide.   note that it s not necessary to hang your lantern. some people simply drop a tea light into a white bag and leave it at that     to fasten the wire securely to the bag  pull it through the grommet and then twist the end of the wire upwards along the rest of the wire.   before you had a tea light to the bag  make sure that the wire is securely fastened to the bag.    an electric tea light is highly recommended  as a regular tea light can pose a fire hazard  particularly if the lantern is hung somewhere where it might be jostled.

packaging  and increase or decrease the amount depending on whether the dog loses or gains weight on this ration.if your dog is more active than most dogs  then you should increase its food intake accordingly. for instance  if every morning you and your furry friend go for a 5 mile jog together  you should consider giving it more food than usual. obviously  you don t want your labrador to become obese. if you cannot easily feel its rib bones anymore  then you are probably overfeeding it. at the same time  you should not be able to see its rib bones from afar.    your lab will get very

home doggie nail salon. eventually  your dog will welcome it.be sure to use proper dog nail trimmers. human nail clippers won t work effectively. secure your dog s foot in place and then quickly clip off the nail. do not clip too close to the base of the nail. doing so can be very painful and cause bleeding. make sure that the nail does not curve back into the dog s paw or is too sharp to cause accidental damage.  your labrador s ears can become breeding grounds for bacteria if not cleaned regularly and properly. check the dog s ears regularly for any excessive or smelly discharge  and seek veterinary advice if you notice anything amiss. if you want to clean the ears  use a specific product designed for the purpose.   do not use a q tip to clean inside your dog s ear. one sudden jerk

are available  many of which come in tasty flavors   e.g. liver  chicken  and peanut butter   that your dog will enjoy. introduce the brush into your dog s mouth gently. use your fingers to lift your dog s lips in order to expose their teeth. work the brush in circles and go from tooth to tooth. its back teeth will be the most difficult to get to  so save them for last. make sure that you brush both sides of each tooth. reward you dog with a treat afterwards.  every dog needs certain core vaccinations on a regular basis. it is a good idea to take your dog to the vet at least twice a year for

love more than food  it is spending time with you   playing  snuggling  or simply following you around..   don t neglect your lab if it wants to play or cuddle up next to your feet while you watch tv. your labrador retriever has not lost its pack instinct. most likely  your lab views you as the leader or one of the leaders of its pack. so if you neglect your lab  it will be affected emotionally.    all dogs are territorial. your lab is no exception. it s natural for them to bark at anything and everything  but when conditioned properly  they aren t so ferocious. make sure that you spend some time at home and out in public training your lab.if you have several dogs  you ll need to gradually introduce your new labrador retriever into the mix. place them in a room or outdoor space divided by a fence of some kind. let the dogs get a sense of one another. they learn a lot by smells  so give them 30 minutes or more to just take in their new companion. next  let them get closer  but keep them on a leash. do this several times  limiting their exposure to the other animal to half hour increments. only when you are confident that they won t attack one another should you let them roam freely. have them play together outside. let them bond.the same rules apply to people. if your labrador retriever is going to get used to being around a lot of people  it needs to be introduced into these environments in a safe way. keep your lab on a leash. have surrounding people strangers pet your dog and be kind to them. tell them to offer their hand to your dog. dogs love to smell people s hands in order to assess their scent. do this frequently. eventually  your lab will learn that people can be trusted.  generally  your labrador retriever will play well with children. however  if you have younger children  you will have to keep tabs on what they re doing with the dog at all times. make sure the child isn t hurting or threatening your dog in any way or this may result in a physical altercation. your dog isn t vicious. it doesn t hate your child. it might just feel threatened by it. if it scratches or bites  it is simply reacting instinctually to a threat. do your best to limit this threat. be present when your child plays with your labrador.  typically  your lab s favorite toy will be a tennis ball. this probably speaks to their inner  retriever . since your lab was bred to fetch wild game  it makes sense that it would enjoy playing with something that is meant to be retrieved. you can find a myriad of other toys at any pet superstore. dog toys are a great way for your dog to play and to burn off excess energy without having to go outside and run around.  teach it how to walk on a leash also. labrador retrievers are an intelligent breed and are often easy to train   especially  when they are younger. a trained dog is more confident and better behaved. in addition  a dog that will listen to voice commands is safer in the event it is ever off leash.when training your labrador retriever  be sure to reinforce positive behavior rather than chastise for negative. never hit your labrador retriever. you are trying to build a trusting relationship with your dog  not create a neurotic and scared animal. dogs that attack people or children without heed are often the product of cruel environments. don t let your labrador retriever be one of them.
