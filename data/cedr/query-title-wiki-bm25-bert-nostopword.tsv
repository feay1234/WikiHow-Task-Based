patiently chip pieces. put pieces along pattern grind glass corrective lines. make sure everything fits well together put glass pieces together. also good idea build frame around pieces finished grinding fitting together. way pieces slip foiling glass. cover edges glass 7 32 inch copper foil. make sure foil centered otherwise look little funky end.. done hand table foiler. decided thickness copper foil need peel protective backing foil. make sure center glass correctly tape press securely along cut edges. press foil hard tongue depressor firm instrument. ensure foil adheres glass. want make sure tape securely adhered well even. section gets bunched tear start again. flux helps solder flow copper taped pieces one hundred percent necessary. however make things easier long run. brush copper foiled surface flux solder time. gel form easiest forgiving use although also try liquid form. soldering glass takes bit time patience. several different things need make sure soldering properly. tack together pieces tin seams finally add bead. tack pieces together apply small dots flux desired areas melt small blob solder top. got pieces tacked together tin seams. tin seams first add flux seams apply thin flat amount solder seams. make sure completely coat copper foil. apply new layer flux tinned seams melt larger amount solder onto seams. run soldering iron back forth create melted seam solder. section completely melted lift iron piece create smooth bead. framing absolutely necessary create nice finish piece. could use zinc frame lead channel requires soldering exactly steps outlined above. especially beginner screw cutting glass grinding down. leave gaps pieces. compensate inaccuracies filling gaps glass pieces copper solder. solder would normally. lots things go wrong scoring glass standing much pressure using sort cutter using.make sure standing long scores. give better reach utilizing shoulder upper body scoring motion. small scores make sure stay seated concentrate following marker score line. use right glass cutter. want use five dollar cheap glass cutter cut clear thin glass well certainly cut much harder art glass. get one carbide head oil lubrication useful. make sure apply even pressure throughout scoring. remember hear zipping sound score. also good remember opalescent glass requires pressure cathedral glass requires less pressure. like scoring soldering glass yield problems correctly. make sure heat correct tip soldering iron right size project flux using good higher temperatures.using wrong kind flux lead charring called black tip syndrome. happens means tip soldering iron turns black tinning becomes impossible. use right size soldering iron tip. make sure know width glass working tip copper spaced accordingly.
