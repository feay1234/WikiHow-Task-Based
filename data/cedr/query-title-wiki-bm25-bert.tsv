query	3	brainstorm brainstorming brainstorm  before you look at what you want to do  think about what you re trying to achieve. this can give you a good starting point  a sort of light at the end of the tunnel.   do you want to brainstorm for your business  are you trying to come up with an idea for you next work of art  maybe you re trying to come up with an idea for an article you have to write     if you have a teacher  boss  client  or someone that will be evaluating your work  find out what they re expecting or what they need. if not  just think about the limitations you must work within and what the final product should accomplish. while breaking requirements can sometimes result in a better experience and final product  knowing all of the limitations will give you a good framework to start working in.   for example  do you need to keep to a certain budget  do you need to use only certain materials  does the project need to be done by a certain time     you ll naturally be assuming some things about your project. what are people looking for  what are your limitations  what is acceptable or normal  what should it generally look like  list these assumptions so that you can play on them later.   for example  with an art project  we might assume that people are looking for a particular color scheme that fits with the theme of a gallery show. for a business project  we might assume that customers are wanting a particular something that our competitor s product does not provide.    take a hard look at what you ve done in the past  what you ve done already  and what you have available to you in terms of resources. this will help give you some boundaries to work with.   what kind of tools do you have to use  what materials or people have you not made use of in a long time  what was something you tried last year and how could it be better  ask others for their opinions.    do some research on what people working on similar projects have been doing. google is your friend in this adventure. you should not be looking at what others are doing in order to copy them. instead  you should be seeing where their ideas fall short or what pieces of their project might fit into yours.    once you see what run of the mill folks are doing  find out what the innovators are doing. seek out the cutting edge and fringe ideas or techniques that other people are experimenting with. you might want to similarly experiment  such innovation can set you apart  making what you do unique  memorable  and appealing.    get outside of your usual environment. this is a great way to break yourself out of the standard creation loop and think of things that you ve never thought of before. go for a walk  go to a local artisan or farmer s market  or work in a cafe for awhile. any change of environment can help you think in different ways.    always have a journal next to your bed. you ll also want to keep a waterproof note taking option in your shower area. good ideas often sneak up on us when we re doing these other activities  but then get lost as we get distracted with whatever else it is we re doing. by having a pen and paper nearby  you ll be able to quickly jot down the things you think of before they fly away     it s important to take breaks  to keep your mind clear of negative response loops. a lot of the time  when you re thinking and coming up with nothing  you get too focused on the fact that you re coming up with nothing  making it impossible to really think.   try having a healthy snack  catch up with a coworker  or do a quick chore  such as cleaning up your mess from dinner .    during the brainstorming process  criticism isn t helpful. you ll need the freedom of minimal boundaries in order to get to new ideas. leave criticism for once you have a long list of possibilities.   if you re brainstorming with other people  you might need to remind some people to keep negative opinions to themselves until the brainstorming activity is done.    don t try to brainstorm with just a cold start. this is like breaking out into a full run without a light jog first  do a quick exercise that gets your head in that space  such as making a menu for your next week s worth of dinners  or coming up with a wish list of things you d like to accomplish in work  school  or whatever it is you re doing.    put yourself in the shoes of your competitor  looking at what you re doing now and trying to figure out how to be better than you. how would they look at what you re doing and do things better  what would they change  where would they go next     giving yourself new roadblocks to reaching your goal  such as a lower budget  a new deadline  or a specific material to be used  can make you more creative and innovative. it may even give you an idea if you couldn t come up with one before.    mind maps are one of the most popular brainstorming techniques. this is where you write down an idea  or several   on a notecard. pin the note card to a wall and then build on the idea. write down every little thing you think of and start connecting the ideas.    create three categories  easy ideas  tough ideas  and crazy ideas. try to come up with at least five ideas for each category. usually  in coming up with ideas we think we can t or shouldn t actually carry out  we find ourselves with ideas that we actually can use.    write a poem that describes what you re trying to do. you can also write a theoretical analysis or review of the thing you re hoping to create. by outlining what you re hoping to get out of the project  you may have an easier time thinking of ways to do it.    take something you ve done before  a long time ago  and find a way to update it. you can also take old concepts that aren t yours and find a way to bring them into this era. for example  twitter was basically telegrams for the internet. some of the most popular products right now make use of classic designs.    online idea generators can be really helpful in getting you started  even if it s just used as a warm up. don t feel burdened by or tied to the ideas that it gives you  but try to use them as a jumping off point. try this    http   ideagenerator.creativitygames.net     always ask questions. ask questions of yourself. ask questions of the people you re brainstorming with. ask questions of your friends and family members. questions lead us to really think through things that we might have glazed over in our minds. ask detailed questions and questions that really get at the heart of the issue. and don t go for the short  obvious answer.   why do i want to paint with oils  why does my customer want this product     there are lots of little exercises  like mind maps  that can be really useful. but a lot of the time they re also a distraction and can hold you back from really getting work done. don t waste too much time on brainstorming activities  and instead try to just get down to business as quickly as possible.    free writing is where you start writing and you just don t stop. this also involves some free association  where you naturally follow the course that your thoughts take instead of trying to direct the current. just write down a sentence that deals with the topic you re trying to brainstorm on and then follow your brain  writing down every word that ambles through your internal dialogue without stopping to think. you never know where it will lead you   
query	4	start chain smoking limit smoking cigarettes  before you change your behavior  you need to understand your current situation. take a baseline  or keep a count  of how many cigarettes you smoke in a day. you can use a calendar  notebook  journal  poster board  or anything that helps you track it consistently. as you track your consumption  try to notice if there are any patterns.   for example  you might notice that on wednesdays you tend to smoke 5 8 more cigarettes than the rest of the week. what is going on on wednesdays  maybe you have a stressful weekly meeting on wednesdays that wind you up  and you smoke to relieve the anxiety.    set a goal once you have tracked how many cigarettes you typically smoke in a day. since quitting cold turkey  cutting out smoking completely  is bound to be stressful  difficult  and may lead to a higher rate of relapse  start by limiting your smoking. you may try going from a pack a day  20 cigarettes  to 15 a day.only you can decide what is the right amount to cut down to  but a good start may be to cut down by a quarter. for example  if you smoke 16 a day  go to 12. or go from 12 to 8.    if you are going to allow yourself five cigarettes a day  decide when you will smoke them. this removes the option of smoking a cigarette when you are feeling bored or have nothing else to do.instead  you have designated smoking times to keep you accountable.   for example  you might smoke one in the morning  two at work  one in the evening  and one before bed.    it may be hard to give up the instant gratification of smoking  especially if there s no immediate reward for cutting back. you need to create a system of immediate rewards and consequences. so  if you smoke 2 more cigarettes in a day than you had allowed yourself to  there should be a consequence. choose consequences that will benefit you in some way.   for example  for every additional cigarette you smoke  tell yourself you have to do 10 minutes of stretching  put a dollar in a jar  clean the bathroom  or journal for an extra 10 minutes. while this is supposed to serve somewhat as a punishment  at least you will have worked in some way to make up for the lapse in discipline.  reward yourself when you meet or exceed your goals. this will make you more likely to continue cutting back. rewards don t need to be tangible things. you could remind yourself that you re investing in your healthy future and that s a reward in and of itself.for example  if your goal was to smoke no more than 8 cigarettes a day and you only smoked 5  you might reward yourself with a glass of wine  20 minutes of playing your favorite video game  or free time. choose something that you enjoy  but don t necessarily have access to all the time.  this will create a progress report. you could even graph your cigarette consumption in order to see the peaks and troughs. here are a few things to consider keeping track of when you re monitoring your smoking habits triggers  watch for what factors trigger higher rates of smoking. cost  track how much money you spend on cigarettes every week. if you re saving money during the week  start putting it aside. after a few weeks  use the money to buy yourself a reward. consequences rewards  notice if certain intervention plans  like increasing or decreasing consequences and rewards  are working or not. this way you can change them to make cutting back more effective.    you may want to limit time around social groups that revolve around smoking. instead  find new places and activities to enjoy.if you enjoy having a few drinks and smoking on the patio at a local bar  you might find it hard to sit on the patio and not smoke. in this case  try moving inside where smoking is not allowed. this will add a level of inconvenience to smoking since you ll have to leave the group you are with to go outside.   give yourself the rule  no smoking in the car. smoke before or after the car ride. make smoking as inconvenient and uncomfortable as possible.  while this isn t an overwhelming change  changing brands may help you reduce your nicotine intake. for example  if you smoke marlboro red 100 s  try switching to shorts or to a more  natural  brand of cigarettes like sherman s. do not let the word  natural  make you think these cigarettes are safe. they are most definitely cigarettes which still contain nicotine. look for cigarettes based on their nicotine content  which are generally low nicotine  filtered cigarettes with the words  ultra light  medium nicotine  filtered cigarettes with the words  light  or  mild  high nicotine  filtered or unfiltered cigarettes that don t say  light  or  ultra light     another way to reduce cigarette smoking is by smoking a quarter or half of a cigarette. then wait until your next cigarette break to smoke the second half or quarter.this way  you smoke as often as you normally do  but only half a cigarette at a time. you still get to take your smoking breaks  but it cuts your cigarette consumption in half.    if you tend to chain smoke in certain settings like a bar or while sitting outside chatting with friends  try setting a timer. it can be easy to lose track and just light another cigarette when you are having a good time. after each cigarette  set a timer on your phone for a time limit of your choosing. wait until the timer goes off before smoking another cigarette.   as time goes on  try to increase the amount of time in between cigarettes. for example  if you set the timer for 20 minutes  push yourself to wait an extra 2 minutes. if you and your friend are both trying to cut down  you can make it into a small competitive game on who can wait longer.  sometimes it is the oral stimulation that needs to be satisfied in addition to the nicotine craving. carry things like breath mints  gum  mouthwash sprays  small hard candy  sunflower seeds  or other small  ideally healthy  snacks for whenever you feel the urge to smoke.avoid high sugar or fattening treats that will just fill you up. make sure not to use treats as an oral substitute for the long term.  tell those around you that you are working on this goal. this can create a good social support network to help you reduce your intake. they can also keep you accountable by asking you how you are doing with your goal. if you have friends that smoke  let them know you are trying to cut down so they do not tempt you.you may even inspire your friends or family to cut down as well. consider referring some of your closer friends and family to this website to help them help you  http   smokefree.gov social support.  a therapist will help you work through issues and stressors that caused you to smoke in the first place. you can work with a therapist in an individual or group setting. cognitive behavioral therapy can help you learn to deal with stress and make you feel more confident about quitting smoking.you can search the national association of cognitive behavioral therapists database for certified therapists. your general practitioner may also be able to recommend a therapist. be sure to find out about any fees that aren t covered by insurance in advance.  stress is a common trigger for cigarette smoking. while it s impossible to completely avoid stress  setting up a coping strategy will help prevent stress smoking.if you start to feel stressed out and crave something to relax you  try replacing smoking with one of the following    a short conversation with a friend 10 minutes to yourself to sit quietly and meditate or stretch a small walk around the block  office  park  or building journal writing for 10 minutes watching a funny video exercising  which can improve your health and help you counter the weight gain that can sometimes come with cigarette cessation.    social support can reduce smoking  but in the end it is up to you. sticking with it is one of the hardest parts and setbacks will occur. the important thing is to not completely give up when you have those lapses in discipline. it happens to everyone. you are learning to live your life without a habit that is a central part of your day  and is often associated with so many areas of your life throughout your day. learning to cut down takes persistence  patience  consistency  and a lot of self kindness.keep tracking  even if you relapse. keep implementing bigger rewards and consequences as time goes on.    once you ve started limiting and reducing your cigarette consumption  you may find that you are ready to quit entirely. you might want to join a support group where you can talk about your cravings and how to reduce them. you could also try incorporating one of the following    nicotine replacement therapy  nrt   this includes nicotine inhalers  oral medications  patches  and gums. they deliver the nicotine without the act of smoking.don t use nrt if you are still smoking  since they can cause a toxic increase in nicotine levels. if you are trying to cut down on smoking  but are not necessarily ready to quit  nrt may not be the best option for you.e cigarettes  electronic cigarettes may help you reduce or quit smoking.while e cigs simulate the puffing of smoking  which may help wean people from traditional cigarettes  it may actually replace smoking instead of wean people off smoking. though e cigs might be less toxic than traditional cigarettes  there is limited research about their safety. caution should be taken when using an e cig as it tends to create the perception that it is a safe alternative.

be any amount. if you win your case  you repay the amount borrowed  plus interest. litigation cost funding. you might need money to pay for the costs of a lawsuit  such as expert witnesses  court reporters  and investigators. sometimes  you might even need money to pay the lawyer s fees. the lender sends a check to your attorney periodically. as the plaintiff in the lawsuit  you agree to pay back the amount advanced plus either interest or a percentage of the amount you win.    your lawyer s cooperation is key to obtaining legal funding. they will need to talk to the legal funding company

no shortage of companies you can contact. if you don t know where to start  perform a general internet search. type  legal funding  and then your type of lawsuit  e.g.   personal injury.    some legal funding companies specialize only in certain kinds of injuries. for example  they may only fund civil rights lawsuits or only personal injury lawsuits. some companies also fund lawsuits in only certain states.check whether they operate in your state. also check whether the company funds  pre settlement  or  post settlement.  some companies will only advance you money if you already have a settlement in place. these are post settlement companies.    once you have a list of companies  you should perform in depth research. you don t want to sign up with a shady company or a scammer.

another  20 000 plus interest  which will reduce your take home amount to  100 000 or less. consider whether you have other options. for example  friends or family might let you move in with them or give you an interest free loan which you can pay back after you receive your settlement.    before applying to a legal funding company  you should talk to someone and ask questions. you want to understand the agreement you are entering. for example  you may want to ask the following    will you be charged a start up fee  are there other hidden fees  what percentage of your lawsuit will they fund  how large of a cash advance can you get  how much interest will you be charged  generally  consumers are charged an annual interest rate of 51 156 .this can add up quickly. when do you have to pay the legal funding company  immediately after receiving your settlement  do you have to make monthly interest payments  does the company provide any additional services. for litigation cost funding  the company may provide a case assessment.  contact the legal funding company and ask how to apply. some companies let you apply online.generally  you will be asked for the following information

the bleach into your head  since the chemicals can burn your scalp. to get salon quality highlights  separate out small sections of your hair that are less than an inch wide. place foil squares under these sections to protect the rest of your hair from receiving any of the peroxide spray. spray these sections and wrap them in the foil sheets to keep them from touching the rest of your hair while you let the peroxide sit in your hair. highlighting your hair is probably easiest to do with a friend helping you. it can be a good idea to just apply bleach to the front section of your hair  allow it to process  and rinse  before doing the back section. putting the bleach mixture over your whole head takes time  and you may not have enough time to finish the back section before the front section needs to be rinsed out.  cover your hair with plastic wrap. let the bleach start working on your hair. the longer you leave it in  the lighter your hair will be. keep checking a strand of hair every 10 minutes until you re satisfied with the color of your hair. don t leave the bleach in your hair for more than 45 minutes total.   several factors  including the volume of your developer and the darkness of your hair  influence how long it will take for the bleach to lift your hair color to the lightness you desire.    rinse out all of the bleach with cool water. then use the special shampoo for bleached hair. dry your hair and check out the color. if you like the color  you can stop there. style your hair normally.   be aware of the different hues that a bleach job will give you  depending on your hair color. dark brown hair will lighten to chestnut brown  but too much peroxide may result in an orange brown color. medium brown will turn to light brown  light brown will turn dark blond  red hair will turn orange  and with enough bleaching  will become strawberry blond  dark blond will turn light blond.  some people will need to tone their hair to achieve a nice white blond color  or to even out some of the color imperfections that their hair has after bleaching. this may not work for everyone  however  and can result in white gray hair that you may not like.the stage for adding toner comes in after you have fully bleached your hair and you will not be trying to bleach your hair further. you should have also already washed and dried your hair so that you can assess the color that your hair has become.    use an old mixing bowl and old spatula and put in the correct parts toner  developer and red gold corrector. be sure to check the instructions on the box to get the correct proportions and measurements.    dry your hair at least a little bit with a towel. use a clean tinting brush to apply toner to your hair in sections  using clips or pieces of tin foil to separate sections that have toner on them from those that still need an application. applying the toner is not as time sensitive as the bleach application stage  so you can take your time a little more now.    this varies depending on the product you are using  but 30 minutes is about the norm. wait until the toner turns a dark purple in your hair. check your hair after about 15 minutes to see how it looks by wiping off some of the purple toner. keep checking every 10 minutes until you have reached the color you want.    rinse your hair under cool water until all traces of the toner are gone. cool water is better than warm water since it stops the developing process  which will stop the chemicals from removing more color from your hair.    purple shampoo is a type of toning shampoo that is used to help distribute purple pigment to counteract brassy hues in your hair. by adding a little bit of purple pigment to your hair  you neutralize some of the reds and yellows in bleached hair  bringing out some blue hues and making your hair a slightly cooler color. rinse your hair in hot water briefly so that the hair shafts open and are ready to absorb more of the purple hue. apply shampoo liberally to your hair  let it sit for up to 5 minutes  and then rinse with cool water. the cool water will seal up the hair shafts and help retain the purple tones in your hair.make sure you rinse it out completely  however  because it will stain towels and it can potentially leave your hair a lavender color if you have white blond hair.   there are several different brands and prices for these  from clairol professional shimmer lights shampoo for about  10 per bottle to unite blonda toning shampoo for about  30. your best bet is to purchase this type of shampoo at a beauty supplies store. talk to a sales clerk for advice on the best shampoo for your hair.    your hair will be brittle and dry after this treatment and will need deep conditioning to restore some moisture and elasticity. use a deep conditioner  store bought or natural  at least once a week  leaving it in your hair for 20 30 minutes and then rinsing it out. results can be improved by heating up your hair with a hair dryer while the deep conditioner is in place. if you have made your own deep conditioner with food  check to make sure it hasn t gone bad. if it s been mixed up for longer than a few days  or a week if kept in the refrigerator   throw it away and mix up a new batch.    hydrogen peroxide is a chemical compound that serves many household uses  from cleaning cuts to disinfecting countertops to removing stains. it can also be used to bleach your hair. hydrogen peroxide is readily available at grocery or drug stores  costing just a couple of dollars for a 32 ounce  910 g  bottle. make sure the peroxide strength is no greater than 3  by double checking the bottle s label of active ingredients. a stronger solution than this can severely damage your hair.  no matter what bleaching method you use  it s going to cause your hair to become drier and more fragile than normal. starting with healthy hair prevents excessive damage from the bleaching process. don t dye or otherwise process your hair for about a month before you plan to bleach it. use gentle products  like shampoo and conditioner made from all natural ingredients  to make sure your hair is as healthy as possible before bleaching.    use a deep conditioner a day or two before bleaching your hair to help build up moisture in your hair. there are many types of deep conditioners  from less expensive   5  8  to more expensive   30   store bought ones to more natural  diy ones. there are recipes to make your own deep conditioner  which typically use foods as their base. search online for  deep conditioner recipes  for suggestions using bananas  avocados  mayonnaise  yogurt  eggs  coconut oil  or other foods.this step will help minimize ending up with extremely dry and brittle hair after you bleach it by increasing your hair s moisture and elasticity.   this step seems time consuming  especially when you want to get started on bleaching your hair. but it is an important step that will save you a serious skin rash  or worse  if you happen to be allergic to the bleach or any of the other ingredients. to do a patch allergy test  apply a dab of bleach on a patch of skin behind your ear. leave the bleach on for 24 48 hours and check for any allergic reaction  such as a rash  itching or burning on that spot. if you do have an allergic reaction  however mild  you should ty a different method for bleaching your hair.    use a clean spray bottle or a recycled one that has been thoroughly washed and dried. this will help you aim your spray more evenly and accurately when applying it to your hair. gather some cotton balls to aid in a more precise application. do a few test squirts to make sure the spray bottle is functioning properly.    peroxide can stain clothing and can be irritating to skin  so take care to cover yourself properly. wear gloves and cover your clothes with an old towel. apply a small amount of petroleum jelly along your hairline and neckline to protect your skin.    wet your hair with lukewarm water and pat it dry with a towel. let it air dry for a few minutes until it s still damp  but not dripping wet. use hair clips to section your hair. divide your hair into a few sections and twist the sections up. clip these sections into easily removable hair clips  it s best to use hair clips you can put in and take out with only one hand  especially after you start the bleaching process. don t clip the first section you plan to bleach.   you can also apply melted coconut oil to your hair before bleaching to help protect your hair. to melt the coconut oil  place the sealed jar into hot water. this will liquefy the oil. pour the oil all over your head and rub it into your hair. wrap your hair in a plastic cap and let the oil soak into your hair for a few hours  overnight is best . do not rinse your hair before applying the bleach.  gather up a small hunk of hair from the nape of your neck. spray the peroxide onto this strand  starting at the roots and working it towards the ends. leave it in for about 20 30 minutes. rinse out the peroxide and check the color against a white towel. this will enable you to check if you like the color before dousing your entire head in peroxide. it will also help you gauge how much time to leave in the peroxide.be aware of the different hues that a bleach job will give you  depending on your hair color. dark brown hair will lighten to chestnut brown  but too much peroxide may result in an orange brown color. medium brown will turn to light brown  light brown will turn dark blond  red hair will turn orange  and with enough bleaching  will become strawberry blond  dark blond will turn light blond.  dampen the first section of your hair by spraying it with peroxide from the spray bottle. make sure to spray it from all sides. the more peroxide solution you use on your hair  the lighter your hair will get. be careful to only spray directly onto your hair  not your scalp  the peroxide may irritate your skin. go slowly  paying careful attention to how your hair is reacting to the peroxide as you progress.   when the first section is damp  unclip a second section and spray it with peroxide. repeat until all of your hair has been treated. if you want to highlight a few strands of hair rather than spraying your entire head  dip a cotton ball in the peroxide and rub it on the strands you wish to die. to bleach streaks in your hair  separate out the chunks that you want to bleach. place foil squares under these chunks to protect the rest of your hair from receiving any of the peroxide spray. spray these chunks and wrap them in the foil sheets to keep them from touching the rest of your hair while you let the peroxide sit in your hair. streaking your hair is probably easiest to do with a friend helping you.    the longer you leave the peroxide in  the brighter your hair will become. be careful not to let the peroxide sit in your hair for more than 45 minutes. if the peroxide begins irritating your scalp  wash it out right away.   using a hair dryer on your hair or another heater during this process may speed up the time it takes to reach your desired color. even though the hair dryer will speed the process  be aware that the heat can damage your hair and could cause hair damage.this is not necessary  however  and if you are not sure how your hair reacts to peroxide  you should skip this heating step.    use cool water to remove all traces of peroxide from your hair  then use a deep conditioner to restore its moisture. allow your hair to dry  then style as usual.    if this first round has not left you with the color that you re aiming for  you can bleach your hair with peroxide again. it s advisable to wait a week between treatments  however  to give your hair time to recover. the bleaching process is highly damaging to your hair and if you bleach your hair two or more times in one day  or even in one week   you risk causing serious damage to your hair  meaning  your hair might even fall out .  your hair will be brittle and dry after this treatment and will need deep conditioning to restore some moisture and elasticity. use a deep conditioner  store bought or natural  at least once a week  leaving it in your hair for 20 30 minutes and then rinsing it out. results can be improved by heating up your hair with a hair dryer while the deep conditioner is in place. if you have made your own deep conditioner with food  check to make sure it hasn t gone bad. if it s been mixed up for longer than a few days

a brief consultation with your hairstylist so you can strategize how you might want to bleach your hair. ask your hairstylist how often they ve bleached hair  how they ve handled different types of hair  etc. also ask for their recommendations on how to handle your hair and how they think your hair will react to the bleaching process.   you should also ask if your hair is healthy enough to bleach. some colorists won t bleach hair that has already been color treated  because it is such a damaging process.  bleached hair does still have variety in terms of hues. you can choose white hair  white blond  platinum blond  or a few other hues. bring in a picture of someone with the same shade of hair that you d like. this will help your hairstylist figure out the best approach to bleaching your hair.    the bleaching process is a slow process and does not happen instantly. the hairstylist needs time to wash your hair  mix up the bleach solution  and apply it to your hair. it needs to sit in your hair for a while  30 minutes or so . then your hairstylist needs to wash it out and dry your hair.   you may need to schedule a second session with your hairstylist if you have very dark hair and you want to go white blond.your hairstylist is also skilled at bleaching highlights into your hair. it is also much easier for another person to do this process  rather than trying to do it yourself. they can see your head from above and can apply bleaching solution evenly over your head.    your hair will be brittle and dry after this treatment and will need deep conditioning to restore some moisture and elasticity. use a deep conditioner  store bought or natural  at least once a week  leaving it in your hair for 20 30 minutes and then rinsing it out. results can be improved by

long your hair is and how much of it you want to bleach  you ll need the juice of 2 to 5 lemons. cut the lemons in half and use a juicer or your hands to squeeze their juice into a bowl. strain the seeds when you re finished juicing.   don t use lemon juice that comes in a bottle. it contains preservatives that may damage your hair.    pouring full strength lemon juice on your hair can really dry it out  so it s important to dilute the juice with water. add an amount of water to the bowl that s equal to the amount of lemon juice.    it s best to use a new spray bottle  which can be purchased at most drug stores  but you can also recycle one you already have at home. if you re using a recycled spray bottle  make sure it is completely clean. wash it out with soap and water before you fill it with the lemon juice solution. shake the lemon juice solution well  and do a few test squirts to make sure the spray bottle is functioning properly.    spray the area you want to bleach liberally with lemon juice solution  making sure the area is completely damp. spray more lemon juice in the areas that you want to lighten the most. the more lemon juice you use  the lighter it will get.   if you want to highlight a few strands of hair instead of bleaching it all over  use a cotton ball to rub lemon juice solution on the parts that you do want to bleach.    the sun will react with the lemon juice and cause your hair to lighten. wait for all the lemon juice solution to completely dry in your hair for about 30 minutes. be sure to cover yourself with sunscreen and clothing to protect yourself from the sun s rays as you bleach your hair. remember that this process can dry out your hair. sitting in the sun for a long time will help your hair get lighter  but it will also cause some damage.    after the lemon juice solution has dried  wash it out with shampoo and then condition your hair with a good moisturizing conditioner. style it as usual.   once your hair is dry  take a look at the color. if you want it to be even lighter  repeat the process again in a few days. don t bleach your hair with lemon juice more often than once every two or three weeks.

or delegate tasks to others at the scene.avoid allowing any person panicking at the scene be it a victim or bystander to affect you. staying calm and collected can prevent panic within the group as well as minimize any damage.  although your first instinct may be to call for help  taking a few seconds to quickly assess the situation can help you provide vital information to emergency services. in addition  it may also alert you to things that should be done before attending to victims.notice things like how many cars are involved  how many victims there are  if there is a fire  smell of gas  or smoke. you may also want to see if there are any downed live wires or broken glass.you might also want to see if there are any children and remove them to a safe location if they are not injured.make sure you are safe in the situation  too. you don t want to be added to the list of casualties. for example  make sure there is no fire or smoke. if you are a smoker  put out your cigarette so that it doesn t ignite any fluid draining from the car.    once you ve made a quick assessment of the accident scene  call emergency services. provide the person with whom you are speaking any information request to the best of your knowledge. ask other witnesses and bystanders to call emergency services as well. these people may have additional information or noticed something about the accident and victim you didn t. remember that the more information emergency services has  the better they can respond to an accident.give the operator information such as your location  the number of victims  and other details you noticed about the scene. describe your specific location  including any landmarks  that can help responders find you. you ll also want to tell the operator about any injuries that victims may have. finally  let the dispatcher know if there are any traffic blockages that may hinder emergency services.ask the person any questions you may have about securing the scene or administering first aid. be sure to stay on the line with the operator for as long as possible. this is true even if you have to momentarily put down the phone to secure the scene or help the victim.    it s important to let other drivers know that there is an accident that they need to avoid. using flagmen  which are bystanders who warn traffic  or flares can alert

you hurt and do you need assistance   if the person responds yes  then provide the best aid you can. if the person says no  do not approach or provide aid to the person for any reason. wait for professional help to arrive and let these people take over from there. make the best assessment you can if the person rejects help and then loses consciousness. in these cases  good samaritan laws will protect you. good samaritan laws protect volunteers who provide aid or assistance in emergencies from legal liability for injuries or damages.remember to approach victims with caution even if they ask for assistance. the person could panic and hurt you  or something you do  such as moving the victim when you shouldn t could hurt the victim even more. check to see if a victim is conscious by lightly shaking the person. if the person doesn t respond  she is unconscious.  remember that many injuries are not visible on the skin. unless the victim is in imminent danger from fire or something else  leave the person in place until emergency services arrive.make sure to approach a victim you have to move by kneeling down to the person s level. not doing so can send someone into a panic and may cause further injury. remember that it s better to move someone whose life is threatened by something like a possible explosion or fire than it is to leave them for fear of further injuring the victim. consider the following phrase when making your decision  am i leaving the person better off than the way i found him    breathing is an absolute necessity to any person s life. if a person is unconscious or loses consciousness  it s vital to check the victim s airway to ensure the person is breathing properly. if not  you may need to give cpr to restart the circulatory and respiratory systems.place your hand lightly on the victim s forehead and very gently tilt back the head. lift up the chin with two fingers and put your cheek by the victim s mouth to see and feel if the person is breathing. you may also want to check the victim s chest to see if it is rising and falling. if so  then the victim is breathing.start cpr if the person is not breathing and you know how to perform it. if you do not know how to do cpr  do not attempt it. instead  ask other bystanders if they are able or wait until emergency services arrives. roll the victim on to the person s side to protect the airway. make sure to support the person s neck to protect or prevent injury.make sure to let the emergency dispatcher know if the victim is breathing and  or receiving cpr.    many advocates suggest providing first aid only if the victim has life threatening injuries. if the victim has injuries that require bandaging  splinting broken bones  or using other advanced first aid techniques  it s generally recommend to wait for professional help  especially if you know it is on the way.keep the injured person as still as possible. talking to a victim can go far in calming the person.pack clothing or bandages around the spine or broken bones to prevent movement. stop any bleeding by applying direct pressure to the injury with bandages or clothing. elevate the area bleeding to chest height if possible. if the victim is conscious  ask the person to apply pressure to help calm any shock.  it s common for car accident victims to be in or fall into shock from the accident. shock can be life threatening if not treated  so if you notice the most common symptom of shock pale skin then treat the person for it.remember the phrase  if the face is pale  raise the tail.  a pale face is a good indicator of shock. loosen any tight clothing and put blankets  coats  or clothing over the victim to keep the person warm. if you are able  raise up the victim s legs. even resting the victims legs on your knees can help prevent or minimize shock. you may also want to shade the victim from the sun or falling rain to minimize shock.  chances are that the accident victim is scared and possibly hurt. talking to and giving the victim encouraging words can help calm the person down until emergency services arrive.offering encouraging words to the victim. for example  you could say  i know you re hurting  but you re strong and help is on the way. i m going to stay with you as long as you need me.  hold the victim s hand if you can. this can be a significant help for a person s sense of survival.    once emergency services arrive  let the personnel take over the person s care. these individuals are better trained to handle car accidents and any injuries.   provide emergency services with any information they should know about care you ve administered to the victim or other things you may have noticed. ask if there is any way you can help them best do their job. in many cases  it will simply be speaking to the police when they arrive on the scene.  
query	8	suggest a foreign language thats easy to learn language acquisition learn vocabulary in a foreign language  learning a foreign language well takes time   there s no way around it. long  infrequent cram sessions just won t work. instead  study or quiz yourself in short bursts of 5 10 minutes. try to do several of these throughout the day.once you build up a good knowledge of the language  you will retain more from longer sessions.    while they seem like the bane of any language student s existence  flashcards are actually a proven way to learn vocabulary. they re also cheap and easy to make. you can keep a stack of flashcards on you and quiz yourself whenever you have a few spare minutes throughout the day. just focus on a few words at a time.you can use index cards for a traditional choice  or websites or apps to create virtual cards. the key to flashcards is repetition  use them often  and quiz yourself on old flashcards  too. use the words as often as you can to help them stick.    studies show that learners need to encounter words several times in different contexts before they really stick. to speed this process up  whenever you learn a new word  look at how it is used in context  and then follow a series of steps pronounce the word and spell it study the meaning of the word  look it up if you don t know it  create a sentence in your own words using the word write the new word and its meaning several times    the same holds true for learning a new phrase. say it outloud  check their meaning if you aren t sure  and make up new sentences that use the phrase.to retain vocabulary  keep using these words and phrases  even after a test or after moving on to new topics.    practicing your foreign language with native speaker or someone who knows it well supercharges your learning. not only will you have the chance to put your knowledge into action and build confidence in speaking  you ll also learn new vocabulary from you partner. all while having fun you can find a friend  tutor  or teacher who you can practice with. check with a language instructor  look online for language groups in your area  or look for someone to practice with online via language learning sites. you can also try a tandem partnership with someone who is trying to learn your language. spend part of the time practicing the language that is foreign to you  then switch to your own language and help your partner learn.    making things interesting and funny greatly increases the amount of vocabulary you retain. get in the habit of coming up with memory aids  or mnemonic devices  for new vocabulary. have fun  the sillier  the better  for instance  you can develop some devices based on sound. if you re learning the word  mesa    table  in spanish   say to yourself  yolanda made a huge mess all over the mesa.  you can create other devices based on meaning. for instance  if you re learning the word      dom or  home  in russian   recognize that shares a root with the latin word  domus    home   and related english words. think of a silly phrase like  donald has a dozen domesticated dogs in his dom.     even if you can t get super creative with all of the words and phrases you learn  it still helps to simply create a visual picture of what you are learning. this can be as simple as imagining the thing you are studying. if you re learning  el pan    bread  in spanish   picture a loaf sitting in a pan. if you re learning  ir    to go    picture a fast car going down the street.  while it sounds like a complicated term  diglot weaving is actually a simple and fun way to learn new words. simply replace a word in a sentence in your native language with the corresponding word in the foreign language. since you can lean on your native language while learning foreign words  it s great for beginners. examples of diglot weaving include  my friends and i split a pizza at the lunch tisch   when learning the german word  tisch   or  table  .  romeo told juliet he d lover her siempre   when learning the spanish word  siempre  or  always  .    words aren t much good unless you know how to use them. learning vocabulary in phrases rather than as isolated words is most helpful because it gives you context to help remember the meaning and gives you practicing using the vocabulary in natural ways. j en ai marre    i ve had enough  in french  is an example of a phrase. learning vocabulary in phrases helps you determine which words to use to  sound right   called collocations . for instance   i had a cup of powerful tea  and  i had a cup of strong tea  are both grammatically correct in english  but the latter sounds right because it is said more often.    watching television  films  and other videos in foreign languages gives you chances to learn new vocabulary and to hear how it is used in authentic speech. if you are interested in the sources  you are more likely to pay attention and learn  so choose some that you love podcasts  youtube videos  streaming films and programs  songs  and similar sources can all be great ways to learn. as you watch and listen  pay attention to any vocabulary you know  and write down new words and phrases you hear.    you can pick up lots of vocabulary quickly from reading  especially if you read out loud. when learning a foreign language  make it a point to read at for at least a few minutes each day. read whatever you find interesting.studying a variety of texts is a surefire way to pick up vocabulary. try reading the news  fiction  essays  comics  and even advertisements. when you encounter new words  try to guess their meaning first  based on the context. then write them down and look them up later for practice and study.    there are tons of possibilities out there  including duolingo  drops  and memrise. while you can t really learn a language just from studying apps  they can be a great way to build vocabulary in a fun  interactive way.most apps involve games  like matching words to pictures  and other tools that can make the learning experience engaging and help you retain words.    groups of words together that relate to a common topic are easier to learn than lists of words that are all over the place. textbooks usually present new words in this way  but if you re learning on your own  you can follow the same principle. for instance  if you are studying german and interested in music  you could study not only  die musik    music    but also words and phrases like     die band    band    der jazz    jazz    das konzert    concert    ich spiele gitarre    i play guitar    mein lieblingss nger ist michael jackson    my favorite singer is michael jackson      if you re feeling overwhelmed by the amount of vocabulary you have to master to in order to understand and use a foreign language  look for cognates. these are words that look the same or nearly the same and have similar meanings in different languages. that means they re easy to remember.for example   computer  in german is  der computer.  likewise   to drink  is  trinken   which looks very similar. just watch out for  false friends   or words that look the same but actually have different meanings. for instance   actuel  in french does not mean  actual   but  current  or  up to date.     many languages  like spanish  german  and russian  group nouns into different grammatical genders  which usually have to relation to biological gender. learn the gender together with the noun s spelling and meaning so you ll know how to use it properly later on.   for instance   dog  in french is  le chien  and not  la chien.  learn the vocabulary as  le chien  and not simply  chien.  similarly  if you re learning verbs  make sure to study their correct conjugation.

to have the other side offer an explanation for what happened. it is possible to obtain these kinds of resolutions in mediation. it s confidential. nothing you say in mediation is revealed  either later in court or to the press.    depending on your point of view  mediation might not be the ideal method for resolving your dispute. for example  the following are features of most mediations    it s voluntary. you might find this to be a strength or a weakness. if you want a definite resolution to a dispute  then mediation might not provide it. in mediation  either side can stand up and end the mediation.you have to compromise. you might be focused on  winning  and having someone say a judge tell the other side that they were wrong. this won t happen in mediation. if winning is important  then you might try arbitration. you usually have to be in the same room as the other person. if you are afraid of the other party  or if you are too emotional  then mediation is probably not effective. mediation doesn t typically have a  discovery  process where you can request information from the other side. accordingly  you shouldn t choose mediation if you are unsure of exactly what happened.    arbitration is more like a trial. you and the other side present evidence and witnesses  and the arbitrator decides who wins the case. the arbitrator can award an amount of money to the winning party. arbitration has a reputation for the following    it s confidential. like mediation  what happens in arbitration is not revealed publicly. arbitration is a formal process. if you re afraid of the other side  then you might find safety in the formality. you can win. you don t need to compromise in arbitration. instead  you can make a demand for money compensation  and if you prove your case then the arbitrator will award you a sum of money. it is usually binding.the arbitrator s decision has the same effect as a judge s decision. there is usually a limited discovery process. although not as extensive as in a lawsuit  arbitration allows for discovery. you can request documents from the other side and potentially have witnesses answer questions under oath before the arbitration begins. discovery is a good way to uncover the full extent of the other side s wrongdoing.    arbitration isn t right for everyone. it has some common features that you should be aware of before choosing between it and mediation. for example  consider the following    you might need a lawyer to put on your most effective case. you can also use a lawyer in mediation. however  because mediation is not adversarial  there is less need for one. it might be a lengthy process. arbitration has a reputation for being a faster alternative to a trial. however  arbitration has steadily become a slower process over the years. it will probably be much slower than mediation.you could lose. if you are the defendant in a high stakes dispute  then going to arbitration and losing is the same as losing in court. if you mediate the dispute  then you can reduce the amount of money you have to pay to the other side.    costs are probably a concern for most people. both mediation and arbitration are generally cheaper than a lawsuit in court. however  they might have different costs  depending on your situation. you should try to estimate the costs before choosing between the two.   if the court or bar association offers mediation or arbitration services  then you should call them up and check how much each generally costs. you can hire mediators by the hour. generally  they charge  70 400 an hour.you can call up a mediator and explain your dispute. ask the mediator to estimate how long they think it will take to resolve the issue. you can get an estimate for the costs of arbitration by talking to someone who has arbitrated a similar dispute.    before you can properly choose between mediation and arbitration  you need to understand what is important to you. give some time to thinking about the following  and rank them in importance    how important is it for you not to have to testify or be cross examined  many people find any kind of dispute stressful  and arbitration could be more stressful than mediation.do you just want money or do you want an apology also  because of its flexibility  mediation might be a better option if you want something other than money. are you unsure about what you want  in this situation  voluntary mediation is a better choice than binding arbitration because you can stop the mediation process at any time. do you want the dispute resolved with as little hassle as possible  if so  mediation is a good bet. the mediator will help guide discussion  keep everyone on track  and help draft a settlement agreement if the mediation is successful. are you risk averse and afraid of losing  if so  then mediation is the better choice.    you might think mediation is the better choice because it is often cheaper and less adversarial. however  mediation will not be successful unless you are committed to making the process work.in fact  mediation will be a disaster if you aren t willing to compromise.   be honest with yourself. not everyone wants to compromise and resolve the dispute in a friendly manner. if someone has wronged you terribly  then you probably won t be committed to mediation. nevertheless  you can always have a lawyer try to negotiate a settlement. if your case is strong  then the settlement amount might be close to what you are asking for in a lawsuit.    you shouldn t pick a dispute resolution technique if you can t afford it. analyze whether you have the money to go through with either mediation or arbitration.    if you want to continue working with the other side  then mediation will be the better option for you. because mediation isn t confrontational  you can leave the process with your relationship intact.however  arbitration might be an acceptable option if you never plan on seeing or doing business with the other side again.    you might have an airtight case. in this situation  arbitration might make more sense since you can win and won t have to compromise. you should analyze your evidence as honestly as possible.   an arbitrator  like a judge  focuses on the law.you should research the law that will be used in your case. for example  if you are suing for medical malpractice  then you can read court opinions from your state on google scholar.read relevant opinions to find out what proof you will need to win your case. you can also ask an attorney to neutrally evaluate your evidence and explain whether you are likely to win under the law.    you may still be confused about whether to pick mediation or arbitration. if so  then you should get a referral to an attorney and schedule a consultation. you can get a referral from your local or state bar association.at your consultation  you should talk generally with the lawyer about your dispute and about what is important to you. the lawyer can then help you decide whether arbitration or mediation is better for you.    you can find mediators in a variety of places. for example  your local courthouse might keep a list of court approved mediators. you can also find mediators in the following places your local bar association. many attorneys are also mediators. you can get a referral to someone by contacting the bar association. a community mediation center. stop into your town office and ask if anything is available. online. you can search for mediators in your city or state by doing a general internet search. private mediation centers. some of the larger include the american arbitration association  jams endispute  and judicate.    you and the other party should agree to the mediator. ask for the mediator s background information  such as experience or a resume. share this information with the other side and make sure you both agree before hiring the person.   remember to get a quote for the mediator s hourly fee.    arbitrators come in many shapes and sizes. for example  you can get an arbitrator who is a specialist in the subject matter of the dispute. for example  if you have a construction dispute  then you can find an arbitrator who has experience as an architect or engineer.you can also have a panel of three arbitrators  though this costs more . for example  you could pick one arbitrator and your opponent could pick one. then the two arbitrators will choose the third arbitrator.    there are many independent arbitrators  who may have been former judges or current lawyers. there are also many national and international agencies that offer arbitration services.   however  you might have already agreed to work with a particular arbitrator. for example  many commercial contracts contain an arbitration clause. this clause might state that you agree to use an arbitrator from a certain arbitration association  such as jams or the american arbitration association. read your contract to see if you have agreed to work with a certain association. if the contract doesn t mention a particular arbitration association  then you can pick your own.

query	11	know who do the spoof  spoofing attack prevent ip spoofing  if you are not familiar with the term  ip spoofing denominates a practice of using different types of software to change the source or destination information in the header of the ip packets. since these packets are sent through a connectionless network  packets in connectionless networks are also known as datagrams   they can be sent without a handshake with the recipient  which makes them convenient for manipulation. number of ways to abuse ip or tcp spoofing  the latter mostly being a non issue these days  kept decreasing with improvements in the overall online security  development of new protocols and increase in user awareness  but there are still people who use this for nefarious purposes. the most common abuses of ip spoofing today revolve around    ip user authentication based exploits   where the intruder impersonates the ip of the internal network they are trying to penetrate. denial of service attacks   either direct where the attacker modifies the destination in the ip packets  sending them to the target address  or indirect  where the attacker sends out requests to different reflectors or amplificators  with the ip s header forged so as to imply that the target site is the source of the packet. this is usually sent to a number of different reflectors amplificators  which all reply to the target site  sometimes with a response which is much larger than the request itself.     this will prevent some of the possible exploits of ip spoofing. ingress filtering prevents the reception of packets that are determined to be coming from a different ip address block than what is stated as the source in their header. when correctly implemented  this prevents attackers from flooding your system with requests. egress filtering prevents packets from leaving your network  if their header seems to be tampered with  which prevents your site form being used as an amplificator or reflector.   if you have a large network  you shouldn t allow internal authentication based on ip. setting up additional layers of protection might come at the cost of some convenience  but it will keep your system much more secure.    cryptographic protocols such as http secure  https   secure shell  ssh  and transport layer security  tls  remove much of the risk of spoofing by encrypting the packets so that they cannot be modified by attackers  and requiring authentication upon receiving a packet.    wishing to reduce the threat of ip spoofing  most of the internet service providers have for a while been offering network ingress filtering. this is to say they try to collaborate with each other in the attempt to monitor the path of the packets  and detect the ones that seem unreliable. checking whether your provider is a part of this agreement is a step in the right direction.    seeing how ip spoofing can be combined with other exploits  giving your entire setup a security upgrade is always a good idea. this extends from penetration testing and introduction of two factor authentication to educating your employees partners on the online security best practices  like not using public networks to access sensitive information and similar.    while following all of the steps above should do a decent job of protecting you from ip spoofing  you still want something to alert you if you ve been an intended victim of one. luckily  there is an abundance of software out there that can help you with this issue  you just need to find something that fits your needs and budget.

future s going to be a tough climb. if you ve got an interest in developing your extrasensory muscles and telling the future  it s a good idea to do some research on your own and learn about the collective unconscious  and the important myths and symbols of your culture.   the writings of carl jung are deeply influential in the way we understand our minds and the connection we have with our subconscious or  unthinking  mind. joseph campbell s the hero with a thousand faces is an excellent resource for finding patterns that recur across cultures and mythologies  suggesting that certain symbols  signs  and portents might be ingrained in us as humans  somehow.    it can be difficult to analyze your dreams if you can t remember them. to make it easier on yourself  keep a notebook beside your bed with a pen ready to go  every time you go to sleep. as soon as you wake up  write down everything that you were dreaming. describe it in as specific an amount of detail as possible. try to do it as soon as you ve awakened  no matter how tired you are.   what did you see  who was there  what did you notice around you in terms of senses like smells  tastes  textures  how did you connect to it emotionally  was it a scary dream  a sexy dream  a pleasant dream  write down dialog first. this tends to be the first thing to go and it can be frustrating to think that something important might have been communicated and not be able to remember what it was.    if you struggle to remember your dreams  wake yourself up in the middle of them. interrupting your dreams is an effective way of recognizing the symbols in them and keeping the images fresh in your mind.   set an alarm on your phone to go off every three hours  which will allow you to complete two full rem cycles of 90 minutes each. you can write down your dreams in only a minute or two  meaning that you ll still be able to get a full night of sleep and will be able to record your dreams.    just as you might with symbols that come up in your meditation  start interrogating the symbols rise out of your dreams and assigning significance and meaning to them.   pick up on lots of different things in each dream. go back to your image of crabs drinking gasoline on the beach. the crabs and the gasoline seem significant  but also consider what drinking might symbolize  what sand might symbolize  and other tactile or emotional elements to the images. how did it feel to watch  people are symbols as well. dreaming that you kissed your best friend doesn t necessarily  mean  that you re in love with your best friend and you should start kissing. when we dream of specific people  it is because our subconscious has attached a symbolic meaning to those people. dreaming of kissing your friend might mean that you re attracted to a certain element of your friend as a person  something that you want to get closer to  or accomplish in your own life.    common dreams  like dreaming that your teeth are falling out  or that you are flying  or that you re in public with no clothes on have common interpretations you re stressed out  you re struggling or succeeding with control  you re vulnerable but you might make more compelling connections to events or coincidences in your own life. use dreams along with your well developed extrasensory perceptions of your life to create your own premonitions and precognitive sense of what the future might hold.   if you re waiting to hear the news after a job interview and dream that you re flying high and out of control  you might take it as a sign that you re feeling anxiety about the idea of success  of the freedom a new job might bring you. which might mean you ve got the job. temper your dream analysis with practicality. if you ve dreamt that your friend is dead  laid out in a coffin  it doesn t necessarily mean  my friend is going to die.  rather  a chapter in your friend s life might be closing  or your relationship might be changing in some way  in the future. apply it to what s going on in your life.    some particularly ambitious and skilled lucid dreamers use waking dreams to attempt to question the future directly. if you ve practiced and developed the ability to remain conscious while you re dreaming  try to visualize a pad of paper  or some other oracle  and ask it direct questions.  who s going to win the super bowl   or  what chance do i have of getting this job   see what happens.    an oracle is a practice  object  or method that allows you to  read  the future. no  you don t need to climb a mystical mountain and present a floating trio of goddesses with a laurel wreath and a clear conscious to consult an oracle. think of oracles like tools for seeing  or like shortcuts to the future.

query	19	leave our daughter understand your teenage daughter  though you can start by asking how her day at school was  don t stop there. it s important for you to really talk with your daughter in order to understand her.   begin the conversation with small  open ended questions such as   tell me about your day.  if your daughter doesn t seem to be responding  let her know you re there when she s ready to talk. if you start with broader questions  follow up with more narrow ones. for example   how was your day    did your chemistry test go well    how do you think you did   try not to rapidly fire off questions though  as you don t want her to shut down. remind her that it s ok to discuss whatever s on her mind and that she won t be judged or criticized for it.take advantage of talking with your daughter while you re in the car together. you ll both be less distracted  plus you can find inspiration for conversations based on what s happening as you drive. you can use the same method while you re watching your favorite shows together. instead of pre recording the program  use the commercial breaks as an opportunity to chat.    one of the many advantages of talking with your teenage daughter is actually getting to know her. you ll probably be surprised to learn how much her interests have changed since she was younger. knowing her interests will help you to relate to her and bond with her.   if you notice  for example  that your daughter is into music ask her to tell you about some of the bands she s interested in now. tell her you d like to listen to some of her favorite songs by that group. even if you don t like the music  refrain from expressing that. if your daughter is into fashion  ask her to show you some of her favorite online stores. you can spend time looking at clothes together and can even plan a trip to the mall to visit more stores there. one of the goals of getting to know your daughter is understanding what motivates her and what makes her happy. that means learning about her aspirations as well as her inspirations  so understand who your daughter looks up to  whether it s a friend  older sibling or a celebrity.    many teenagers depend on social media to make them happy. discuss what social media sites she is on and what she hopes to achieve in using the sites.keep the discussion from feeling like an inquisition by asking her about some of her favorite sites. you ll probably be surprised to discover there are sites you have never even heard of. for sites you re unfamiliar with  ask your daughter to show you around. learn how the site works and what the basic features are. ask your daughter about times where she had uncomfortable experiences online. discuss what steps she takes to protect herself from unwanted attention  such as using privacy settings. online etiquette should also be discussed. talk about what type of language is appropriate to use and what cyberbullying means. most states have rules surrounding cyberbullying  so read up on your state laws prior to the discussion.  make sure that you discuss the dangers of drinking and doing drugs  without being overly preachy. talk about some of the repercussions for using drugs and drinking alcohol as a minor.   remember that her brain isn t great at processing risks right now  so help her out by explaining some of the negative consequences associated with drinking. you may want to share some of your experiences to help her feel more at ease about opening up to you. even though you shouldn t ever encourage her to drink  let her know that you re always available to drive if she is in a bad situation. reiterate that she should never get into the car with a drunk driver and that you will come and get her  without fear of repercussions.    whether she s frustrated  embarrassed or angry  let your daughter know her feelings matter too.  don t roll your eyes or tell her she s overreacting. for example  respond by saying   i hear what you re saying. it sounds like you re really angry with your friends. that must be difficult.  if you re in a heated discussion or just having a serious conversation  always give her the opportunity to speak. don t just brush off what she says. make eye contact  nod while she s speaking and really listen. repeat back what your teen said so that she knows you have listened to and acknowledged her feelings.    one of the best ways to validate your daughter s feelings is to show your support with a hug. sometimes your teen doesn t want to talk. sometimes she s simply needs your affection and attention.   if your daughter is really upset you may want to say   it sounds like you re going through a tough time. can i give you a hug   a hug can be a good resolution to an argument as well. take a few minutes to cool off  then approach your daughter and summarize what her side of the argument was. ask her for a hug afterwards to show that you love and support her.    you may think she s too young to experience such issues  but if your teen mentions she s depressed or suicidal  acknowledge what she s saying and act on it.   one in five teenagers are diagnosed with mental health issues  so it s important to acknowledge her feelings.although occasional moodiness or bouts of sadness is fairly normal for teenagers  take note if she s withdrawing from friends and family or suddenly has lost interest in all of her favorite activities.be supportive and let her know she s loved and that this issue is worth your time and attention. show that you ve acknowledged her feelings by scheduling an appointment with a mental health professional. go with her to the appointment  take notes and ask questions about treatment plans.    these days it may seem as if your daughter is constantly challenging your authority. this struggle for control is perfectly normal  though and is a sign that your teen is seeking greater independence.  your daughter is not only growing physically  but mentally as well. she is forming opinions about how the world works and oftentimes  her opinions do not align with yours. think of some areas where you can be more flexible and are willing to give up some control  to allow her to be more independent. for example  if you typically shop for and choose her outfits  give your daughter the responsibility of choosing her attire. set some ground rules for appropriate attire  but ultimately leave the decision up to her.    for a teenage girl privacy is very important. respect her wishes that she might want some uninterrupted time alone once in awhile.   knock on the door before entering and ask her if you can come in. let her demonstrate responsibility during this alone time. don t assume she s doing something she shouldn t be.if you notice your daughter is spending too much time in her room and seems withdrawn  you should talk with her about what s going on. there may be a larger issue at hand  such as depression. if you still have concerns about her spending time alone  talk about expectations and boundaries ahead of time. for example  she shouldn t expect to have alone time when there s a boy in the room.    let her go out with friends or attend a concert on a school night. try to find the right balance between being overly protective and completely loose when it comes to rules.   even though she s getting older  your daughter should still have boundaries. for example  letting her go on a date is fine  but be sure to establish a curfew and discuss appropriate venues for the date. trust her to spend the night at a friends house without constantly checking in on her.    as a parent you tend to make a lot of decisions. however  it s important to let your daughter in on the process as well  whether it s establishing a bedtime or setting a curfew  you need to allow her to start making her own decisions.   as your teenager transitions into an adult  she needs to practice making decisions on her own. let her take the lead when it comes to the way her room is decorated or how her hair is cut and styled. you may even want to involve her in family decisions such as where to go on vacation. every teenager is unique and matures at a slightly different rate. start with small decisions and see how she does before moving on to bigger ones.  part of understanding your daughter is recognizing that  in addition to all of the other changes occurring  her brain is actually developing as well.different parts of the brain mature at different times. the parts of the brain associated with things such as impulsiveness  reward and motivation actually mature earlier than parts of the brain associated with weighing the pros and cons of ones actions. as a result  your teenager may not consider consequences in the same way you would. this is why it may be important to discuss risk taking behavior and their consequences  with her.    it may be difficult to believe  but your daughter s tendency to stay up until the wee hours of the night is due in part to her changing brain.  though the tendency may be to stay up late  lack of sleep further contributes to irritability and depression. it s important to still regulate your teenage daughter s bedtime and to encourage her to get a full night s rest.    it s not just your imagination  your daughter s emotions are heightened during the teenage years. the intensity of the emotions is also different than yours  so keep that in mind when you re in the midst of a discussion or an argument with her.if you notice your daughter is overreacting  give her some time to cool down. she may react strongly at first  but be sympathetic to the fact that her brain is going through a period of change as well.

query	21	prepare for a shakespeare play shakespeares plays write a play  plays are character driven pieces of writing. since it s basically going to be a lot of talking between people  your characters need to be as believable as possible. in great plays  the inner tensions between characters enact themselves in external ways. in other words  the characters need to have problems that show up in their behaviour.   what does your character want  what is keeping your character from getting what they want  what stands in their way  thinking of interesting jobs can be a good way of developing a character. what s the hardest job you can imagine  what s a job you ve always been curious about  what kind of person becomes a podiatrist  how does one end up with such a job  don t worry about the name or the physical description of your character. it doesn t tell you anything about a character named rafe to know that he is 6 4 and has washboard abs and wears t shirts some of the time. stick to one notable and telling physical trait. maybe your character has a scar on their eyebrow from being bitten by a dog  or maybe your character never wears skirts. this reveals something about them and gives them depth.    the setting of the play is where and when the story takes place. placing your character in a tense situation or location is an important way to create drama. combining character and setting can also be a good way of developing your character  and figuring out what kind of story might result from their placement in that setting. if being a podiatrist is interesting to you  what about being a podiatrist in paris  texas  what kind of person becomes a podiatrist in paris  texas  for instance  how does one end up there    be as specific as possible when developing your setting.  the modern day  isn t as interesting as  dr. wilson s family podiatry  next to the the west hillsboro suburban mall  just south of town  at 3 15 pm on good friday.  the more specific you are  the more you ll give yourself to work with. consider what other characters the setting may introduce. who works the desk at the podiatry office  if it s a family business  maybe the podiatrist s daughter. who has an appointment on a friday  who s waiting  what are they in for     the  inner  story refers to the psychological conflicts happening within the characters. this is largely hidden throughout the story  but it s important for you to have some sense of as you re writing the play. the inner story will guide the characters throughout their decisions throughout the plot. the more concrete the inner story  the easier the characters will be to write. they ll be making their own decisions.   maybe your podiatrist wanted to be a brain surgeon but lacked the stomach for it. maybe the podiatry program had the least strenuous schedule  and allowed the med school version of your character to stay up late partying while still passing all their classes. maybe the podiatrist is deeply unhappy and unfulfilled about having never left paris.    bad plots look backward and good plots look forward. it wouldn t be interesting to have a play in which your podiatrist talked endlessly about how she d rather not be a podiatrist and then killed herself with shoe polish. instead  find a dramatic situation to place your characters in that will test their mettle and change them in some way.   if it s good friday  maybe the podiatrist s retire parents  former podiatrists themselves  are coming for an easter dinner. is your podiatrist even religious  will she go to church  does she have to get home and clean up the house before the weekend starts  is her father going to make her check out his bunions  again  will this be the last straw  what will happen     remember  you re not writing a movie. a play is basically an ongoing series of conversations between people. the focus needs to be on the tension between the characters  the language  and on developing your characters into believable people. it isn t a great medium for gun fights and car chases.   alternatively  break from traditional theatre and write a play with impossible to stage scenes as a way of exploring the writing itself. if you have no plans to actually stage the play  treat it as a different form of poem. bertolt brecht  samuel beckett  and antonin artaud were all innovators of experimental avant garde plays who incorporated audience participation and other absurdist or surreal elements into their drama.    just as you wouldn t try to write a novel if you d never read one  it s a good idea to get familiar with the world of contemporary theatre. check out plays you ve read and liked to see how they transform on the stage. david mamet  tony kushner  and polly stenham are all popular and celebrated playwrights.   it s important to see new plays if you re going to write new plays. even if you ve got a good working knowledge and love of shakespeare  it s important to get familiar with what s going on in the here and now. you don t live in shakespeare s era  so it wouldn t make sense to write plays as if you did.    even if your plan for  easter with the podiatrists  seems like you re on your way to claiming a tony award  you ll still manage to surprise yourself in the writing. you may have the greatest idea in the world  but you still have to actually write the thing and allow for surprise to enter into the equation.   in the exploratory draft  don t worry about formatting the play or writing it  correctly   just let everything get out that needs to get out. write until you ve got a beginning  middle  and end to your play.maybe a new character will wander into the story that changes everything. let it happen.    a play is literally a slice of a life  it s not a biography. while it can be tempting to want to jump ten years into the future or have the main character quit her job in the podiatrist s office and become a successful actor in new york  a stage play isn t the best medium for these kinds of seismic shifts in character.   your play might end with a simple decision being made  or it might end with a character confronting something they ve never confronted before. if your play ends with a character killing themselves or someone else  rethink the ending.    in the early drafts  you ll probably write a lot of scenes that wander without really going anywhere. that s ok. sometimes you need to have the character spend a long awkward dinner conversation with their brother in law to find out something that gives you a whole new perspective on the drama. great  that means you re writing successfully  but it doesn t necessarily mean the whole dinner date is important to the play.   avoid any scenes in which a character is alone. nothing can happen on stage with a character in the bathroom looking into the mirror. avoid too much preamble. if the podiatrist s parents are going to arrive  don t delay for twenty pages. make it happen as soon as possible to give yourself more to work with. make it easy on yourself.    your characters will reveal themselves with their language. the way they choose to say things is maybe even more important than what they re actually saying.when the podiatrist s daughter asks  what s wrong   the way the podiatrist answers will tell the audience how to interpret the conflict  maybe she faux dramatically rolls her eyes and sobs  everything   and throws a stack of papers in the air to make her daughter laugh. but we really know there s something wrong she s making light of. we ll look at her character differently than we would if she said   nothing. get back to work. don t let your characters shout their inner turmoil. a character should never shout   i m a shell of a man since my wife left me   or anything that explicitly reveals their internal conflicts. make them hold onto their secrets. you want their actions to speak for themselves  and not to force them into explaining themselves to the audience.    the refrain of the writer   kill your darlings.  you have to be a harsh critic of your early drafts to get the usually messy early writing crafted into the hard hitting and realistic drama you want to write. cut scenes that meander  cut characters that are useless  and make the play as tight and as quick as you possibly can.   go back through your drafts with a pencil and mark any moments with a circle that pause the drama  and underline moments that move the drama forward. cut out everything that s circled. if you end up cutting out 90  of what you ve written  so be it. fill it back in with things that move the story forward.    there s no right number of drafts. keep going until the play feels finished  until its satisfying for you to read and fulfills your expectations of the story.   save each version of the draft so you can feel free to take risks and always go back to the old version if you want to. word processor files are small. it s worth it.    an act is a mini play unto itself  made up of several scenes. the average play involves 3 5 acts. generally  a scene will have a given set of characters. if a new character is introduced  or if the character s move elsewhere  that indicates that you re moving on to another scene.   an act is hard to distinguish. the podiatrist story  for instance  might end its first act with the arrival of the parents and the introduction of the main conflict. the second act might involve the development of that conflict  including scenes in which the parents argue with the podiatrist daughter  easter dinner is cooked and church is attended. in act three  the daughter might reconcile with the father  giving his troubled foot a once over. the end. the more experienced you become at writing plays  you ll be able to think in terms of acts and scenes as you write your initial draft. don t worry about it in the early going  though. the formatting is much less important than getting the drama right.    each scene should start with stage directions  in which you describe briefly the physical components of the stage. depending on your story  this might be very elaborate or fairly simple. this is your opportunity to influence the way the play will eventually look. if it s important to have a gun on the wall in act one  put it in there.   also include character directions throughout the dialog. the actors will take their own liberties with the dialog and move about as they and the director sees fit  but it helps to have any particularly important  as you see it  physical motions included throughout the dialog. a kiss  for instance  is probably important to direct  but don t overdo it. you don t need to describe every minute physical movement of a character  because the actors will ignore such directions anyway.    in a play  each character s dialog is marked with their name in all capital letters  tabbed in at least 4 . some playwrights will center the dialog  but it s up to you. you don t need to use quotation marks or other distinguishing features  just separate the language by including the character s name every time they speak.    this includes any prologue you d like to include to the play  a list of characters and a short description of them  any notes you d like to include about the set up of the stage or other directing guidelines  and possibly a brief summary or outline of the play if you re considering submitting the play to theatre contests.

query	30	make love with a girl the paper love a girl  most girls love getting showered with affection and compliments from a guy they care about. some girls can be insecure  and love getting reassured a lot. to be affectionate  just give her a gentle touch  put your arm around her  hold her hand  or do whatever you can do to give her a little bit of physical touch. this doesn t mean you have to use everything you have on her  pick the right moments to let her know you care and it ll mean a lot more than having your arm around her for four hours.   giving her a little kiss on the cheek or a squeeze of the hand is another way to be affectionate. if holding hands isn t your thing  you can put your hand on the small of her back when you re walking.    if you want to love your girl  then you have to support her as much as you can. being supportive means anything from showing up to her soccer games to encouraging her to apply for a job even if she s worried she won t get an interview. you should be there to lift her up  not put her down  and let her know you think she s amazing and capable of anything she puts her mind to. this doesn t mean you have to follow her around and be her cheerleader at all times  she should support you too  but it does mean that you should let her know that you will help her succeed in any way she wants.   sometimes  this may mean just supporting her when she is upset  sad  or confused. you have to be there for her during the good times and the bad.    you don t have to transform your whole personality and start throwing your jacket over puddles to show the girl you love her. however  if you want to show her that you care  then yeah  you should probably stop belching and scratching yourself when you re hanging out. otherwise  she ll feel like one of the guys  and you have to make an effort to make her feel different from your bros. make sure to hold open doors for her  pull out her chair when you re on a dinner date  let her walk in front of you when you walk into a place  and give her your jacket when she s cold.   being a gentleman will make her feel like you re paying special attention to her. if you want her to feel loved  then you ve got to make that extra effort.    it can be hard for a lot of guys to know what it means to be thoughtful. basically  it means that you should really put some thought and effort into how you treat your girl  based on what you think she will or will not like. so  take the time to really listen to her when she speaks  and to know what makes her tick. if it s the morning before her dance recital  send her flowers. if she s having a rough week  write her a love letter. if you re at the movies  get up to get her her favorite snack. take the time to get to know what will make her happy  and make the effort to give that to her.   if you know she s feeling low  acknowledge her moods and say   i can imagine that you would feel...  while you shouldn t say you know exactly how she feels  put in the effort to let her know you ve thought about what s going through her head. pay attention. if she mentions a book she d like to read or a new album she hasn t heard yet  give them to her as a small gift. she might say   i can t believe you remembered that   now  that s love.    if you want to love the girl  then you have to be understanding of the fact that she s only human and has flaws  needs  and desires  just like everyone else. you can t expect her to be perfect or to live up to some unreasonable expectations. if she makes a mistake  don t spend weeks being resentful and being dismissive of her. if she flakes on you once  don t sulk about it for days. obviously  if she mistreats you constantly  then you should reevaluate your relationship  but if she has a few bad days here and there  don t act like it s the end of the world.   think about it  maybe she s having a really hard time adjusting to a demanding new job. maybe she s suffering emotionally because her grandmother or mother recently passed away. try to see things from her perspective before you get angry or start a fight.    part of loving a girl is knowing when you should back off a little bit. maybe she s had a bad week and really wants to be alone  respect that. maybe she wants to have a night out with her girlfriends  tell her you hope she has a great time and don t text her every five seconds to make sure she s not flirting with some other guy. if you don t smother her  she ll feel your love more  and she ll love the fact that you respect her individuality.   however  it can be tricky. you have to recognize whether she really doesn t need your support  or if she s just saying that because she doesn t want to be a burden. you have to figure this one out on a case by case basis.    if you want to love a girl  then you have to make some romantic gestures to let her know that you really care about her. don t do anything that feels forced or just completely unnatural to you  but make an effort to make your girl feel extra special. this can mean sending her flowers  buying her a box of chocolates  or doing something a bit more original that reflects on the nature of your relationship. here are some other ways you can be romantic    write her a sweet message in a card just because. make her a delicious home cooked meal. tell her you love her at the right moments. write or recite her a poem. take her dancing. go on a moonlit walk. have an impromptu picnic. take her to a jazz concert. write love notes to her. serenade her with love songs.    if you are used to keeping your thoughts and feelings to yourself  try speaking up more often. maybe you don t open up because that also means opening yourself up to being teased or rejected  but by being more open  your relationship with this girl can become more intimate  and love thrives on intimacy. you don t have to tell her every little thing about yourself right away  but you should work on being more open and telling her things you don t normally tell anyone. this will show her that you love her and that she stands out from the rest.   being open relates to being honest. though you don t have to tell her about how you saw a cute girl walking by that day  you should be as honest as you can without needlessly hurting her. if she s opening up to you a lot and you don t give her a lot to work with  then she may feel like you re not as invested in the relationship. of course  some guys are a lot less open than others  but you should work on being as open as you can with her while still feeling like you re being yourself.    get to know her. show her that you re interested in who she is as a person  what she s thinking  and what she s been up to. you don t have to interrogate her to make her feel like you really care about her. when you re together  ask her how her day went. ask about her plans for the next day. when you really get to know each other  ask her about her plans for the future. here are some other things you can ask her about to let her know you love her    her passions her friendships her family her worries and fears her goals her everyday life    if you want to love a girl  then you have to let her know she is loved. this doesn t mean you have to compliment her every five seconds  or it will begin to feel like you re not being sincere. instead  just giving her a few meaningful and unique compliments can be much more effective than giving her so many compliments that she doesn t even hear them anymore. work to compliment a unique aspect of her personality or her looks  or something else about her. here are some examples of compliments you can give her     you re so good at staying positive in the middle of a bad time. i wish i knew how to do that.   your friends all love you so much. you re so supportive.   i love the color of your eyes. i ve never seen eyes with flecks of hazel like that.     if you want to love her  then you have to view her as an equal. you can t just treat her like a prize or a trophy  let her know that her opinions matter to you. make an effort to ask her what she thinks about everything from current events to what you should do with your life. take the time to pick her brain and see how she really feels about things  girls need to feel like you respect their intelligence. here are some things you can ask her about    what you should do in a certain situation current events her thoughts on movies  albums  and books anything you re unsure about    you should also pay attention to what you say when you re not with the girl. while you shouldn t call her and text her every five seconds  you should make an effort to let her know you re thinking about her when you re not together. if you re apart for a day or two  make sure to call her or text her to check in so she knows you re thinking about her. if she s away for the weekend for something big like a wedding or tournament  make sure to see how it went. let her know that you don t just stop thinking about her the second you re apart.   on the other hand  don t make her feel smothered. if you know she s going to be super busy  you have to be comfortable with letting her do her own thing instead of getting in her way.    sometimes  when she says she doesn t want to talk about it  she really means it. if something bad happened to her  she may just need some time for it to sink in. don t bother her or pry too much if you can tell she s really just not in the mood to talk about it. this can make her more agitated and even less likely to want to talk to you. you may feel like the best way to show your love is to keep bothering her to talk  but sometimes the best way to show your love is just to back away a little bit.    if you want to love a girl  then you have to let her know when you ve made a mistake. if you ve done something wrong  it s important to apologize    and mean it. don t just deny what you did and hope that you can both move on with your lives. if you want the girl to really love and respect you and to see that you care for her  then it s important to apologize when you ve made a mistake and to make an effort not to do it again.   look her in the eyes when you apologize. show her that you really care. don t say   i m sorry that you were upset when i   really make it clear that you know that you have made a mistake.    if you want to love a girl  then you have to know how to talk to her. this means being able to tell your side of the story while also hearing her out. it means learning to compromise  to find a way to make each other feel happy. it means listening to your girl without interrupting. and it also means picking your battles. you should work on having much more positive interactions than fights  and on letting her know how you really feel instead of keeping your feelings bottled up inside.   if you want your love to last  then it s absolutely important to remember that it s better to be happy than to be right. work on finding a way to make you both feel respected and fulfilled than just on getting your way all the time.    if you want to show your love to your girl long term  then you ve got to have at least a few things that you love to do together. this can be going on long morning hikes  reading together at a coffee shop  checking out your favorite museums on sundays  going to see your favorite band play live  or really anything that makes you both happy and that you love doing together. while you shouldn t have all of the same interests  you should have at least a few things that you both care about so you can make your love last.   as relationships progress  it s easy for couples to feel like they have nothing in common anymore. that s why it s important to find things that you always love doing together. if both of you are getting sick of one of your favorite interests  don t just drop it. find something to do in its place.    though it s important to find a comfortable routine of doing a few things that you love together  it s equally important to mix things up and to do new things as often as you can. maybe you ve been playing pool together for years  and it s time to switch to darts. maybe you ve been vacationing in tahoe every summer  it could be time to try yosemite. make an effort to do new things together so you can love your girl forever.   be spontaneous. though planning is great  so is taking a surprise last minute trip  or buying tickets to a concert at the last second.    if you want to love your girl  then you have to love her and yourself as individuals. make sure you don t lose sight of who you are as a person and she ll love you even more and see that you love her more for it. if you continue to follow your own interests  spend time with your friends  and do some things apart  you ll actually be loving your girl even more because you ll be showing that you re comfortable enough with your relationship that you don t have to spend every second together.   and make sure she maintains her independence  too. if you re both going out into the world and doing your own thing  you ll have more to talk about when you re together. if you re spending 24 7 together  then you ll quickly run out of things to talk about.    it doesn t matter if you ve been together for 8 or 80 years. you always have to make the effort to tell your girl you love her  whether you just say it  or you write it in a card. never think that you don t have to say  i love you  because your girl should know how you feel. that s just never the case. tell her you love her in the morning  in the evening  or whenever the moment strikes you. just don t let a day go by without saying it.   there s a difference between saying   love you   and   i love you.  make the effort to really say it.    if you want to love a girl  then you have to keep the passion and romance in your relationship alive. even if you re living together or even married  it doesn t mean you have to stop being romantic because you ve been together so long. remember that the chase is never over and that you have to work on setting a romantic mood  making your girl feel special and loved  and taking the time to pay attention to your girl.   stick to your date nights. don t let anything get in the way of that weekly time you spend together. you should both really dress up and go out for a nice  romantic dinner once in a while just to keep your love strong  no matter how busy you are. never stop trying to charm or romance your girlfriend. if you want to make love last  then you should both always continue to make an effort. never interrupt her while she is talking or talk back to her. it is rude and disrespectful.  
query	31	reclaim the pyramid build a model pyramid  it s easiest to make an equilateral pyramid  meaning the sides of the structure are all the same size.          fabricate the base. pyramids have 4 sides  so you will need a square base. pick a size  say 6 inches  15.2 cm  by 6 inches  15.2 cm . measure the dimensions with a ruler and draw an outline for the base on your construction paper. measure an additional 1 2 inch out from all sides of the base and draw the outlines. these extensions on each side of the base will provide flaps that you will use to secure the base of the pyramid to its sides. fold the flaps so they extend upward from the base. measure and cut the 4 triangular sides of the paper pyramid. make the base and sides of each triangle the same width as the base of the structure. in this model  they should be 6 inches. also measure and draw in flaps on the right side of each triangle  just as you did for each side of the base.    use a straight edge to make a precise fold along each flap.           while the paint is still wet  cut horizontal and vertical lines at regular intervals with the edge of a piece of paper. this will give the effect of individual stones in your pyramid project.                    apply glue to the outside edge of one of the flaps on the base and press a triangle onto it. repeat with the other 3 sides. dab glue on one of the triangle flaps and join it to the section to the right. gently force the 2 sections inward so their apexes meet. continue with the next connection  again making sure the tops of the triangles form the summit of the pyramid. when connecting the third and fourth sides of the structure  put glue on both of the remaining flaps. join the 2 sections on the left first and then pinch the last junction together. make sure the tips of the 4 triangles meet  forming the pyramid summit. dab a bit of glue at the top. then gently place a thin wire ring on the pyramid. it should be narrow enough to rest about three quarters of the way up the pyramid. this will help hold the tips together while the glue dries.   nan  you ll need sugar cubes  at least 100  more if you want to make it bigger taller   a flat piece of cardboard   1 x1   larger if your pyramid will be bigger   rubber cement  and optionally sand and lots of baking soda  and an extra piece of cardboard  any size .           glue a base layer of sugar cubes with the rubber cement  such that they form a large square  for example  6 cubes by 6 cubes .          start off with a bigger base  if you want to make a bigger pyramid.    brush a little rubber cement over the top of the first layer and then form another square of cubes on top. this layer should be one cube smaller than the layer below  for example  5 cubes by 5 cubes .           make sure that it is properly centered each time.           you can fill out the pyramid to make it look as it would have when it was new  if you want to. do this by making a relatively dry baking soda paste  mix baking soda and water . spread the paste onto the pyramid and smooth the four sides using the edge of the extra piece of cardboard.          mix in the water a very small amount at a time until a sand like mixtures is formed and the baking soda holds its shape when you form it. the smooth  white sides like this is how the pyramids would have originally appeared. while they are just stone blocks now  they used to have a smooth layer of white limestone over the top  so that they would sparkle in the sun     if you want to make your pyramid look like it does in real life today  get a can of tan spray paint and spray the pyramid before continuing. be careful to use only the minimum amount of paint and to do your painting outside  with everything underneath and around it covered in newspaper.           next  you will want to cover the cardboard in rubber cement or preferably elmer s glue and then  while it is still wet  cover the glue in sand or brown sugar.           let the sand and glue mixture dry but also allow the baking soda paste to dry  if you wanted to add it. be careful with the baking soda paste  as it will crumble away easily.           you can add some toy palm trees or make a nile river from cut out construction paper to really make your project shine.

determine your level of psychic ability    are you a natural psychic medium  some people begin seeing visions  hearing messages  or strongly feeling the presence of spirits from a very young age. they don t necessarily know what they are experiencing until they get older. the natural psychic mediumship is exceedingly rare. are you clairvoyant  clairaudient  or clairsentient  perhaps you feel on the cusp of developing abilities in one of these areas. you re sensitive and receptive to feelings  emotions  and communications from others  and you ve had experiences that you consider to be paranormal.

other mediums. decide whether you recognize yourself in their stories and experiences. learn as much as you can about the history and practice of psychic medium ship.   read books by psychic mediums

awareness and opening your third eye    pay attention to your intuition. don t dismiss your dreams. acknowledge the odd feelings and urges you feel. recognize the various energies that affect you throughout the day. spend quiet time by yourself every morning. after you wake in the morning  before starting your day  spend time allowing thoughts and emotions to wash over you. don t control what comes  welcome and absorb it. open your mind to the possibility of receiving communications from energies generated outside yourself. try free writing. write what comes to your mind the moment it arrives. don t judge the words  and avoid editing them. read back over what you wrote a few hours later. the messages you receive from other beings won t always be clear  but writing them down may help you find patterns.    a good way to start is by finding a medium ship circle  a group of mediums who gather to receive messages from the other side. this will give you an introduction to the setting that should be arranged for effective communication. once you re comfortable with the process  try it on your own  or invite other mediums to join you.   set up a room in a quiet part of your house. dim or turn off the lights. a few candles may help create a spiritual setting. say a prayer or chant to ready the space for communication and call on spirits to join the circle. recognize the presence of the spirit or spirits that join you. allow yourself to receive images  words  feelings  smells   whatever the spirits wish to communicate. ask the spirit to identify itself. when you receive an answer  confirm it out loud. continue communicating with the spirit by asking questions and receiving answers. know that at this early stage you will not be able to control the effect the communication has on you. you may feel frightened  or you may experience pain. as you develop your skills as a medium  you ll be better able to control the way you communicate with the other side.

the deceased or any details  otherwise  it is not a valid reading. it is up to you to validate the deceased loved one s name  occupation in life  birth date  physical description  how they passed  and so on. remember that doing a psychic reading is a big responsibility. it can be a very emotional process for all parties involved.    it is possible to have a very successful career as a psychic medium once you re confident in your abilities. build a website to advertise your services. set up a room in your house or rent a space to be used for the purpose of holding sessions with clients.

depend on each other. for example  if you make an agreement to do something together or help with something  make sure you do it.  although it might sound too simple  making a commitment to trust your boyfriend will help you act accordingly. if you both agree to this  you ve helped set expectations for your relationship.    an important part of learning to trust your boyfriend is thinking about how they feel and being sensitive to their emotions. if you expect your boyfriend to do this for you  then you also need to make this a priority in your relationship.an important part of this step is listening and respecting what your boyfriend thinks and feels. even if you disagree with something they say  don t dismiss their feelings or act in a way that is disrespectful.    building trust

wishes. at the same time  when he shares something personal with you  reassure him that you will keep his confidences.    mistakes are inevitable in a relationship  and if both you and your boyfriend can acknowledge you made a mistake and sincerely apologize  you will both learn to trust each other and be more secure in your relationship.   many arguments can be solved more easily if both parties

your ability to trust your boyfriend. if you ve talked it through and he s offered a sincere apology  then you need to try and let it go.bringing up the past or injured feelings each time you have an argument makes it difficult to trust each other and communicate honestly. if your boyfriend feels like you react this way to every situation  he might not want to be honest with your or communicate openly.    spending time with your boyfriend is an important way to build trust  but you also need to make time for yourself and your family and friends. time away from your boyfriend will help you trust your own instincts and can even provide new insights into your relationship.   if you have concerns about whether your trust is misplaced  talk with close friends or family about your worries. this might help you analyze your feelings and gain new perspective on whether your trust is deserved or misplaced.    trust is not something that emerges overnight. instead it requires a lot of hard work  patience  and commitment.depending on the nature of your relationship and the struggles life throws at you  expect to have doubts about whether or not you should trust your boyfriend. he will also likely experience similar doubts at one point or another. this is natural  but how you handle these doubts and concerns will determine how strong your relationship is.    regardless of what caused your loss of trust or the feeling of betrayal  your relationship won t be able to move forward unless you and your boyfriend can communicate with each other about what occurred to cause a lack of trust and discuss how you are both feeling.   make sure you have this conversation face to face. trying to communicate openly and honestly is hard to do over the phone  via email  or through text messages because you can t look into someone s eyes and gauge their behavior and expressions.try to be as honest as possible when you discuss these difficult topics. while it might initially be less painful to avoid analyzing or reliving a painful event  chances are good that the unpleasant questions about what happened will re emerge if you don t confront them head on.as calmly as you can  explain what your boyfriend did to make you feel like he betrayed your trust. instead of making this an accusation  explain that this is something you are feeling or thinking. open the conversation with phrases such as  i am worried about. . .  or  i am concerned that. . .  the situation might not be what you think it is  and you don t want to potentially damage your relationship. even if your trust has been violated  accusing your boyfriend will probably make him defensive and angry  making the conversation even more unpleasant. if you feel like this conversation is too difficult to have without help  set up an appointment with a counselor or therapist who can facilitate the discussion.    while no one wants to deal with a betrayal or loss of trust  think about the opportunities that emerge from this situation. consider this a chance to strengthen  solidify  or rebuild your relationship and address underlying problems.   viewing your situation in this way can help you cope with the betrayal and learn to trust your boyfriend again.    if you ve lost trust in your boyfriend as a result of a betrayal  you need to establish or negotiate new guidelines for your relationship because it s changed and you don t want to repeat the same mistakes. setting new terms will help make sure you are both on the same page and have the same expectations.   think about stressors that might have led to the feeling of betrayal or mistrust. for example  if you lost trust in your partner over an issue with money  agree on how you both will spend money in the future. set specific guidelines and commit to following them. if you never set any guidelines or rules in your relationship  this is an excellent time to start and will make sure you have the same expectations and agree on what is appropriate behavior and what is not.    regardless of who experienced a loss of trust in the relationship  you need to both be sensitive and empathetic toward each other s feelings and concerns. this will help get your relationship back on track and improve your ability to communicate with one another.   no one wants to continue talking with someone who can t be sensitive to their emotions or try to understand how their significant other feels.    to rebuild trust in your relationship  you ll need to learn to trust your own instincts  which can be difficult after a betrayal. the more you trust your own ability to tell if someone is being honest and open  the more confident you can be placing trust in your boyfriend again.to make you more aware of what your instincts are telling you  experts suggest paying attention what your body is telling you. do you feel a prickling sensation on your skin or a sense of physical discomfort  if so  your instincts might be telling you to be wary.research suggests you should also pay attention to your initial reactions or first response to a situation. this doesn t mean you should fly off the handle without evidence  but

confidence in the relationship  talk with your boyfriend about what you could both do to prevent these fears from gaining ground. is there a simple way to reassure yourself or for your boyfriend to reassure you that these fears are not grounded in truth  the more confidence you have in your instincts  the better able you will be to manage and handle your fears.    rebuilding trust in a relationship is challenging  and you shouldn t feel embarrassed or ashamed about asking for help. a couples therapist  marriage counselor  or other licensed mental health professional can help you and

letter cases  and is recognizable by a distinctive horizontal line running along the tops of the letters that links them together.a chart with the devanagari alphabet is available here  http   www.omniglot.com charts print hindi.pdf.    hindi has 11 vowels  some of which are indicated by the use of diacritic marks  or symbols added to the letters of an alphabet in order to show different pronunciations.vowels in hindi have two forms  one form for when they are used by themselves  and one form for when the vowel is joined to a consonant in a word.  a and   aa    does not change the consonant  so if you see a consonant without a modifying symbol  it will have this vowel sound.when   is added to a consonant  you add the symbol   to the end of the consonant  for example    na becomes    naa when   is added to it .     i and   ee  when   is added to a consonant  you add the symbol   to the left hand side of the consonant  before the consonant . when   is added to a consonant  you add the symbol   to the right hand side of the consonant  after the consonant .     u and   oo  when   is added to a consonant  you add the symbol   beneath the consonant. when   is

consonants in hindi.they are organized in the alphabet by how you use your mouth and throat to pronounce them. because hindi uses more consonants than english does  some of them have no direct equivalent in english.the  a  next to some consonants indicates that they are pronounced as aspirated  i.e.  with a strong breath of air such as p in  pit  or  puff  .   velar consonants  pronounced by using the back of the tongue at the roof of your mouth  e.g.  k or g in english     k    k  a     g    g  a     n  palatal consonants  pronounced by raising the front of the tongue just behind the gums e.g.  j in  job      ch    ch  a     j    j  a     n  retroflex consonants  pronounced by curling the tongue backward and touching the roof of your mouth just behind the gums  none exist in

little complicated  but don t worry  once you start trying to practice the sounds  you ll be able to feel the difference between voicing and not voicing.voiced consonants are pronounced by vibrating your vocal cords.for example  voiced consonants in english include z in  zoo  and g in  good .  unvoiced consonants are pronounced without vibrating your vocal cords. for example  unvoiced consonants in english include s in  snap  and k in  kitten .    hindi consonants also fall into two basic subcategories  unaspirated and aspirated. you can have unvoiced unaspirated consonants  unvoiced aspirated consonants  etc.aspiration is another term for a burst of air released through your mouth. the only way to really understand how this works in hindi is to listen to recordings.    the hindi

online  but the one at hindibhasha.com is widely recommended by university language departments.    nouns are words for objects  places  emotions  animals  and people. in hindi  all nouns have a gender  masculine  m  or feminine  f . the gender of hindi nouns is essential for proper grammar and communication  so when learning hindi nouns  you must also learn their genders so you can use the nouns correctly.a very general rule to determine the gender for a noun is words that end with the vowel   aa are usually masculine and words that end with the vowel   ee are usually feminine. however  there are many exceptions to this rule  so it s important to still learn the gender of every noun through memorization and practice.for example  the noun for boy is        larkaa  m  and the noun for girl is        larkee  f . so in the case of these nouns  the general rule of gender applies. on the other hand  nouns like      kelaa   banana  m  and      mez   desk  f  or    ghar   house  m  are all exceptions to the general rule of gender.    simple pronouns like  he  she  i  we  they  are key to communicating in any language  including hindi. the pronouns in hindi are first person singular      main   i first person plural     ham   we second person singular     too   you  intimate  second person plural      tum   you  informal      aap   you  formal   a note on informal and formal pronouns  each pronoun is used based on the level of politeness in a conversation. use the formal    aap when meeting someone for the first time  talking to someone older than you or simply to show respect to the person you are addressing. use the informal     tum when chatting with your friends or close relatives. use    too when you are in a very informal or intimate conversation  such as talking to your partner or to young children. it would be considered extremely rude in hindi to use    too when talking to a stranger or someone you barely know.   third person singular     yah   he   she  it   this third person plural     vah   he   she  it   that  in spoken hindi these words are pronounced slightly differently     is pronounced yeh and    is pronounced voh. use    yeh when talking about someone or something close to you  so if someone is standing right next to you  use    yeh. use    voh when talking about someone or something further away  so if someone is standing on the other side of the street  use    voh. when in doubt  use    voh.   third person plural     ye   these   they third person plural     ve  those   they  you will often hear    ve being pronounced as the singular  voh . the third person plural pronouns follow the same rules     ye for people   things close to you  in the distance sense  and    vo for people   things further away. note that both    yeh or    voh could mean either  he  or  she   so there is no difference based on the gender of how you are talking to. you must rely on the context of the sentence to determine if a person is talking to a  he  or  she .      verbs describe an action  occurrence  or state of being. learn hindi verbs in the infinitive form  in english   to        as verbs are conjugated by dropping the infinitive ending and adding other suffixes. hindi infinitives end in    naa.examples of hindi infinitives include       honaa   to be        pahrnaa   to read or to study        bolnaa   to speak        seekhnaa   to learn       jaanaa   to go.  like nouns  verbs in hindi must be conjugated to reflect grammatical categories such as number  gender  tense  and mood.for example  the infinitive verb      honaa  to be  conjugated for number becomes           main hoon   i am        ham hain   we are       too hai   you are  intimate         tum ho    you are  informal         aap hain   you are  formal        yah hai   he she this is       voh hai   he she that is        ye hain   these they are        ve hain   those they are   there are three conjugations for gender in the present verb tense   for masculine singular subjects  drop the infinitive ending    naa and add    taa. for masculine plural subjects  drop the infinitive ending    naa and add    te. for feminine singular or feminine plural subjects  drop the infinitive ending    naa and add    tee.   because hindi verbs have many tenses  you ll want to use a textbook or other reference materials to learn verb conjugations beyond the basic present tense. a good reference dictionary will also help you conjugate new verbs.    once you become more comfortable with hindi nouns  pronouns  and verbs  you can move on to studying other elements of hindi.  oxford university press publishes the gold standard of dictionaries  the oxford hindi english dictionary.while smaller pocket dictionaries are fine if you just need to look up a word or two  invest in a more substantial academic dictionary if you are serious about more formal study.   there are also hindi dictionaries online. the university of chicago s  digital dictionaries

query	40	win emmy law & order: special victims unit take action against lease violations  the repair and deduct remedy allows you to deduct money from the rent  up to a certain limit  in order to make repairs in the rental unit. you can only use this remedy when there has been a substantial violation of the implied warranty of habitability. examples of substantial violations might include a leak in the roof during rainy season  no heat during the winter  or no hot running water.   this remedy has certain legal technicalities that can make it difficult to put into action. therefore  if possible  you should speak with a landlord tenant lawyer or another professional to make sure you are proceeding correctly.in addition  some states  for example indiana  do not allow this remedy.make sure your state allows this remedy before you proceed.    before using the repair and deduct remedy  you must make sure the defects to your rental unit were caused by the landlord and not by you  your family  guests  or pets.remember  while the landlord must maintain your unit in a livable condition  you must work with them and hold up your end of the agreement. if the defect was caused by something you should or should not have done  you will not be able to use this remedy. however  if the defects were caused by your landlord  this remedy may be a good option for you.   for example  if  when you moved in to your unit  the bathroom did not include a shower or toilet  the defects were clearly caused by your landlord in breach of the implied warranty of habitability. however  if the defect was caused when you tried to use your bedroom as a kitchen  you may not be able to take legal action against your landlord.    in order to properly use the repair and deduct remedy  the defects in your unit must be serious enough to affect your health and safety.different states will analyze this requirement differently  so make sure you get help if you need it. if you have a major defect  you will usually be able to use this remedy. however  if the defect is only minor  you may not be able to repair and deduct.   examples of major defects include a broken hot water heater  a front door that will not lock  a toilet that will not flush  a broken heater during the winter  or a unit filled with deteriorating lead paint. examples of minor defects include a leak that causes a small stain in the ceiling  a furnace that makes noise when it runs  a screen door with a broken latch  a lobby that needs to be vacuumed  a broken heater during the summer  or an apartment with faded paint.  if you are going to repair the defect yourself and deduct the cost from your rent  the repairs cannot cost more than one month s rent.therefore  calculate how much it will cost to make the repairs before you get them done. if the repairs will cost more than one month s rent  do not use this remedy.   for example  assume you pay  1 400 in rent each month and your hot water heater is completely broken. when you call a repair person  they give you a  1 500 estimate to fix it. in this instance  you should not use the repair and deduct remedy because you will only be able to deduct  1 400 for the repairs. you will end up paying  100 out of pocket.    before you make the repairs yourself and deduct the costs from your rent payment  you must notify your landlord of your intentions to use the repair and deduct remedy and give them an opportunity to fix the problem. whenever you give notice to your landlord  it should be in writing. the letter should contain a detailed description of the defect and the repairs that are required. make sure you sign and date the letter and keep a copy for your own records.   send the completed letter to your landlord through the mail or deliver a copy to them in person. when you deliver the notice to your landlord  request a signed receipt as proof they received it.  once your landlord has been notified of the serious defect  they must have some time to fix the problem. the amount of time you need to give your landlord will depend on the seriousness of the problem. in most states  30 days is considered a reasonable amount of time. however  if the defect is serious  e.g.  a broken heater in the middle of winter   a couple of days may be considered reasonable.  if the landlord fails to make the required repairs within a reasonable time  you may make the repairs yourself or hire someone to make them for you. once the repairs are completed and it is time to pay rent  you can deduct the cost of the repairs from your rent payment. keep all the receipts as evidence of the repair costs. it is also a good idea to include a letter with your rent check that explains why money has been deducted from your normal rent payment.for example  assume you have a serious defect in your rental unit that was caused by your landlord. you gave your landlord notice of the defects and a reasonable time to fix them. your monthly rent is  600 per month and the repairs will cost  250. when your landlord fails to fix the defects in a timely manner  you hire someone to fix them and pay them  250 for their work. when rent is due  you will be able to deduct  250 from your normal monthly payment. therefore  you will only pay  350 that month instead of your normal  600.    you should not use the repair and deduct remedy if you are unsure about whether you meet any of the requirements. for example  the defects may not be serious enough to allow you to use this remedy or you may have inadvertently caused the defect yourself. in these circumstances  if you use the repair and deduct remedy  your landlord may sue you to recover the money deducted from your rent. in addition  your landlord may file an action to evict you based on nonpayment of rent.   also  be aware that you can only use this remedy twice in any 12 month period.  if the defects in your rental unit cost more than one month s rent  or if you simply cannot handle the time and hassle of making repairs  especially if you are having to do this often   you might choose to abandon the rental unit instead of repairing and deducting. when you abandon the rental unit  you move out. in order to use the abandonment remedy  the defects in you unit must be so serious that they substantially affect your health and safety  i.e.  the landlord violated the implied warranty of habitability .   similarly to the repair and deduct remedy  you must be able to distinguish between major and minor defects. if your defect is major  you will most likely be allowed to use this remedy. however  if the defect is only minor  you may not be able to abandon the property.  before moving out  you need to keep a detailed record of the defects giving rise to the lease violation. this is important because you will have to give notice to your landlord and because you need to make sure the defects were not caused by you. remember  if the defects were caused by you  your family  your guests  or your pets  you will not be able to take action for lease violations.   when you keep a record of the defects  take pictures  write down notes  and keep track of other important information so you have it when you inform your landlord. you might even have an inspection of the property done to evidence the seriousness of the defects.  before you abandon the rental property  you must notify your landlord of the defects and give them an opportunity to fix the problems. when you give notice to your landlord  do it in writing. the letter needs to contain a description of the defects and the repairs that are required. when you are finished writing the letter  sign and date it. keep a copy of the letter for your own records.   send the completed notice to your landlord or deliver a copy to them in person. when you deliver the notice  make sure your landlord gives you a signed receipt as proof that they received it.allow your landlord an opportunity to fix the defects. before you can move out  you must give your landlord a reasonable opportunity to fix the defects. if the defects are fixed in a reasonable amount of time  you will not be able to abandon the property. in most states  30 days is considered a reasonable amount of time. however  serious defects may require the landlord to act quicker. for example  if tree roots are blocking the main sewer line and your toilets do not work  a reasonable amount of time may be one or two days.  if your landlord does not fix the defects in a reasonable amount of time  you should notify them that you plan on moving out and abandoning the property. the letter should include all of your reasons for moving out along with evidence that your reasons are legitimate. your notice should include a description of when you will move out and that you will return all keys to the landlord.   within your notice you should also provide all of the evidence of the defects that you have collected. this might include pictures  inspection reports  and handwritten notes. your notice might also discourage your landlord from suing you by stating the legal standard you are using to abandon the property.  once you provide notice to your landlord you will move out of the rental unit. make sure you return all of the landlord s property to the landlord  i.e.  keys to the unit .do not leave any of your property in the unit and do not do anything to make the unit more defective than it already is. if you fail to move out properly  i.e.  if you cause major defects or leave your property behind  your landlord might be able to bring an action against you to recoup some costs.    if the defects do not rise to the level required to use this remedy  the landlord might sue you to collect rent and or damages. these damages can be substantial considering you are breaking your lease and moving out of your unit completely. great care should be taken to ensure you are using this remedy properly.  the remedy of withholding rent from your landlord can only be used in very serious situations. when you withhold rent you are choosing not to pay your landlord some or all of the required payments. in order to use this remedy properly  the defects to your unit must be more serious than defects justifying the use of repair and deduct or abandonment remedies. therefore  the defects must be so serious that they immediately threaten your health and safety.   for example  in california  a court allowed a tenant to use the withholding remedy when the defects were so serious that the unit was unequivocally uninhabitable. in that particular case  the tenant had all of the following defects at the same time  a collapse of the bathroom s ceiling  a continued presence of rats and cockroaches  a lack of any heat  plumbing blockages  exposed and faulty wiring  and an illegally installed stove.  if your defects rise to a similar level to those seen in the california court case and they were not caused by you  you need to notify your landlord of the defects and give them a reasonable time to make the repairs. your notification should be in writing and should detail all of the defects present in your rental unit. include photographs  videos  witness statements  and inspection reports if possible. when your letter is complete  sign and date it and give it to your landlord. make sure you get a signed receipt as evidence that your landlord saw your notice.   once your landlord is notified of the defects  he or she will have a reasonable amount of time to make repairs. in a rent withholding situation  the defects are likely going to be so serious that a reasonable amount of time may only be one or two days.  if your landlord does not repair the defects in a reasonable amount of time  you can withhold some or all of the rent. you can continue to withhold rent until all the repairs are made. to determine how much rent to withhold  courts will usually use one of the following tests the percentage reduction in rent. to use this method  you need to determine the percentage of your unit that is uninhabitable due to the defects. the rent will then be reduced by that amount. for example  if one of your four rooms is uninhabitable  you will be able to reduce the amount of rent you owe by 25 . therefore  if your normal rent is  1 000 per month  you will only pay  750 per month until the necessary repairs are made. the reasonable value of rental unit. to use this method  you will determine the value of the rental unit in its defective state. you will then pay your landlord the difference between the normal rent value in your lease and the defective rental value. for example  assume you determine that the value of your unit is  200 per month in its defective state. you can further assume your normal rent payment is  600 per month. in this example  you would withhold  200 every month and pay  400 in rent until the defects are repaired.    when you withhold rent  do not spend the withheld money. the money you withhold should be placed in an escrow account and you should notify the landlord that you are doing so. an escrow account is a special type of bank account used to hold money that may or may not belong to someone else. you should do this for the following reasons first  rent withholding cases often end up in court. if the judge disagrees with your calculations  you may have to pay your landlord a portion of the money you originally withheld. if a judge rules against you  you will have to make the required payment within five days of the judge s ruling. second  placing the money in an escrow account provides evidence that you are not withholding rent to simply avoid payments. third  a lot of legal organizations will not represent you unless you have placed your withheld rent in an escrow account.    as with the other lease violation remedies  there are inherent risks in using the withholding method. if the defects are not serious enough to allow for this remedy  the landlord can sue you for rent and may even be able to evict you. even if you win a court case about withholding rent  the court may not agree with the amount you withheld and may require you to pay some of the withheld money to the landlord.  all of the other methods in this article allow you to take action against lease violations without bringing a lawsuit. as a last resort  if no other remedy gives you the desired outcome  you can file a lawsuit against your landlord to collect damages if defects are not repaired. you can file a lawsuit without ever trying any of the other remedies available to you. to win a lawsuit against your landlord  you must generally be able to show all of the following the rental unit has a serious defect affecting habitability a housing inspector has inspected the unit and deemed it to be uninhabitable the defects continue for 35 days after the housing inspection is completed and the landlord is made aware you did not cause the defects the landlord still tries to collect rent from you    before you file your lawsuit  you should notify your landlord of your intentions. your notice should describe  in detail  the defects that need to be repaired. you should notify your landlord that you will give him or her a reasonable amount of time to make the repairs before you bring the lawsuit. if your landlord fails to make the repairs in a timely manner  you should contact your local housing department to schedule an inspection.   during the 35 day waiting period  you need to collect evidence of the defects. evidence can include pictures  videos  witness testimony  and inspection reports. all of these documents will be used in court to help you prove your case. before you file your lawsuit  talk with a landlord tenant lawyer about your case.if you do not know a good lawyer in your area  contact your state bar association s lawyer referral service. after answering a few general questions  you will be put in contact with multiple qualified lawyers.    in order to file a lawsuit  you will need to prepare a formal complaint. a complaint will contain a caption  which includes the court s name  the parties  names  and a title  i.e.  complaint . the first section of your complaint will introduce the parties and the factual situation that has led you to file the suit. there should be a statement of all the important facts as well as the legal standard you are suing under.   your complaint will also need to tell the court why it has jurisdiction over the case. in this scenario  it will usually be enough to say the rental unit is located in the county where you are bringing your suit and the defendant resides in that county as well. the last part of your complaint will ask the court to provide a certain remedy  e.g.  an award of money damages .  once your complaint has been written  you will need to file it with the court in the county where the rental property is located and or where the defendant resides. to file your complaint  take it to the courthouse and hand it to the clerk of courts.he or she will stamp your complaint as filed as soon as you pay the filing fee  which is usually around  200  300.    once you file your complaint  you will have to serve a copy on your landlord  who is now the defendant in your case. to serve the defendant  have someone over the age of 18 who is unrelated to the case deliver or mail a copy of your complaint and summons to the defendant. a summons is a form the court will give you when you file your case. once the defendant has been served he or she will have an opportunity to respond to your case by filing an answer.   an answer responds to all of your allegations by admitting or denying each statement you made. the defendant s answer may also contain counterclaims if he or she is choosing to bring an action against you.  once the defendant s answer has been filed you will usually attend a case management conference with the court to determine a schedule of events. discovery will start as soon as this conference ends. you will participate in formal discovery by using discovery tools to ask the other party for information. once discovery ends  the defendant may choose to file a motion for summary judgment. this motion asks the court to end the litigation by claiming there is no way you can win based on the evidence uncovered so far. you will have to defeat a motion for summary judgment by showing the court there are genuine issues of material facts and that the defendant is not entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.   if you succeed in your defense of the motion for summary judgment  you might consider settling your case before trial begins. trials are often time consuming and expensive. a lot of defendants will be willing to settle to avoid trial. you can usually resolve disputes without litigation by taking part in informal settlement discussions  mediation  or arbitration.  if settlement offers fail  you will have to go to trial. trial will start with you picking a jury. as soon as the jury is empaneled  you will make an opening statement. your opening statement will provide a road map of your case and what you intend to prove. the defendant will have an opportunity to make an opening statement after you.   the case will really begin when you present your case to the court. you will do this by offering evidence of the landlord s lease violations through witness testimony and exhibits. once you present your case  the defendant will have an opportunity to present his or her case. after the defendant presents his or her case  both parties will have an opportunity to make closing arguments. during closing arguments  you will recap the important pieces of evidence and highlight why you should win. once the trial is over  the jury will deliberate and return a verdict. if you chose not to have a jury  the judge will consider the evidence and make a decision. once a judgment is entered  you will have to comply with the order. if you win  you will be awarded damages. if you lose  you might be able to appeal to a higher court.  most residential leases are signed  written documents laying out the obligations of you and the landlord. even if your lease is an oral agreement  state laws will dictate how each party must act. while most landlord tenant relationships go smoothly  problems will sometimes arise. if you are a tenant and you feel like your landlord has done something to make your rental unit unlivable  look through the lease agreement for a remedy.in particular  look for provisions about habitability  repairs  and breaches  i.e.  violations . these provisions will be important in helping you determine whether a lease violation has occurred and how to remedy it.    research your state s landlord tenant law or ask a professional about your state s implied warranty of habitability. in most states  before a unit can be rented  and while you are renting it  your rental unit must be fit to live in  i.e.  habitable . this obligation is assumed to apply to all residential leases  which means your landlord must abide by the law even if there is no habitability provision in your lease.there is only one state that does not have an implied warranty of habitability. in arkansas  when you rent a residence you take it  as is   which means the landlord has no obligation to maintain the premises.  while most statutes require a unit to be fit for human occupation  they do not state how that is to be done. instead  court cases over time have determined what makes a residential unit habitable or uninhabitable. if your unit meets the definition of uninhabitable  the landlord has violated your lease and you can take certain actions to remedy those violations.   when a state defines habitability  they may define it by what is unacceptable  i.e.  by what makes a unit unlivable . if your dwelling lacks any of the following  it might be considered uninhabitable  effective weather protection  plumbing facilities in working order  heating facilities in working order  lighting  sanitary grounds  adequate trash receptacles  and working floors  railings  and stairs. other states might define habitability by what must be present in your residential unit. in general  your residential unit must have the following to be considered habitable  a working toilet and shower  a kitchen with a sink  natural lighting in every room  safe emergency exits  operable locks on all doors and windows  working smoke detectors  and a locking mailbox.  while almost every state has an implied warranty of habitability  it is not without limits. as a tenant  you must fulfill certain legal obligations to make sure your unit remains livable. most states will require you to take reasonable care of your unit and to take certain specific actions. if you fail to hold up your end of the agreement  and your failure caused your unit to become unlivable  your landlord will not be required to make repairs. in general  you must do all of the following to make sure the implied warranty of habitability continues to work in your favor keep the unit clean use gas  electricity  and plumbing fixtures properly dispose of trash not destroy or deface your unit not remove any part of your structure use the premises properly  i.e.  use the bedroom as a bedroom and not as a kitchen  notify the landlord as soon as possible when things do not work properly

query	42	watch this video mary poppins say the hail mary prayer  our lord is with thee. blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb  jesus. holy mary  mother of god  pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. amen.for a more modern version of the hail mary  replace  thee  with  you    art thou  with  are you   and  thy  with  your .if you would like to honor tradition  feel free to keep saying the  thees  and  thous   but consider that the classic version is itself an archaic translation from latin. ask yourself which is more important  the specific words  or the meaning behind them.    benedicta tu in mulieribus  et benedictus fructus ventris tui  iesus. sancta maria  mater dei  ora pro nobis peccatoribus  nunc et in hora mortis nostrae. amen.    this is a traditional roman catholic practice of reciting three hail marys in sequence as a petition for purity and other virtues. say these hail marys after waking in the morning  say them before going to bed at night  after examining your conscience.say the following prayers in succession each punctuated by one standard hail mary to honor mary s power  wisdom  and mercy    say the following words before the first hail mary  oh  immaculate mary  virgin most powerful  i beseech you  through that immense power which you have received from the eternal father  obtain for me purity of heart  strength to overcome all the enemies of my soul  and the special favor i implore in my present necessity.  name the favor . mother most pure  forsake me not  despise not my prayer  graciously hear me for god s glory  your honor  and the welfare of my soul. to obtain this favor i honor your power by reciting   say the hail mary .  say these words to frame the second hail mary  oh virgin mary  my mother  through that ineffable wisdom bestowed upon you by the incarnate word of god  i humbly beseech you  obtain for me meekness and humility of heart  a perfect knowledge of the divine will  and strength to accomplish it always. oh mary  seat of wisdom  as a tender mother  lead me in the path of christian virtue and perfection  enlighten and enable me to do what is most pleasing to your beloved son  and obtain my petition. to obtain this grace i honor your wisdom by reciting   say the hail mary .  repeat this phrase to preface the third hail mary  oh  mother of mercy  mother of penitent sinners  i stand before you sinful and sorrowful  beseeching you through the immense love given to you by the holy spirit for us poor sinners  obtain for me true and perfect contrition for my sins  which i hate and detest with all my heart  because i love god. mother most merciful  help me in my present necessity. turn then those eyes of mercy toward us  oh clement  oh loving  oh sweet virgin mary  to obtain this precious gift  i honor your loving mercy by reciting   say the hail mary .     you can say hail marys anywhere  but you may be able to reach a deeper level of reflection if you set aside a peaceful  intentional space for the words. some people like to say the prayer in a quiet  solitary room  some people prefer to recite a hail mary in church or other group prayer sessions. find a place and time that make you feel peaceful  comfortable  and meditative.    it is traditional to kneel while reciting a hail mary  although you can also say the words while standing. either way  keep your back straight and your head upright. face something meaningful  an altar  a picture or statue of mary  or anything that you feel enhances the power of the words you re about to say.   if you kneel  put your knees on a prayer bench  on a pillow  or directly on the floor. if you stand  try to keep your legs straight  in a solid stance. either way  try not to focus on your legs   focus on the words and the intention behind them.    the rosary is a catholic sequence of prayers that mary  the mother of jesus  asked us to remember  it is a meditation on the mysteries of jesus  life. the prayers are performed on a string of beads used to count each prayer. you can buy a rosary online  at some churches  or at certain catholic serving markets. if you can t find a rosary  try making your own.    this phrase precedes the hail mary  and it serves to set an intention for the prayer. by dedicating your words to the holy trinity  you acknowledge that you are not praying to mother mary  per se  but rather asking her to pray to god with you.  hold your pressed hands in front of your chest. point your fingertips up. this is a classic  prayer pose . by pressing your hands together  you focus your physical and spiritual energy into one spot so that you can make the hail mary as meaningful as possible.    the hail mary prayer also called the angelic salutation is a traditional catholic prayer asking for the intercession of the virgin mary  the mother of jesus. in roman catholicism  the prayer forms the basis of the rosary and the angelus prayers. in the eastern orthodox and eastern catholic churches  a similar prayer is used in formal liturgies  both in greek and in translations. it is also used by many other groups within the catholic tradition of christianity   including anglicans  independent catholics  and old catholics.   some protestant denominations  such as lutherans  also make use of a form of the prayer.    many catholics believe that although mary was a godly young woman  and greatly blessed to bear the savior  she was not divine. mary was not sinless  according to this narrative  as such  you should not worship  venerate  or pray to her. others  however  place much more reverence upon our lady  and assert that devotion to mary is a way to get closer to god.  the text of the hail mary prayer incorporates two bible passages   hail  full of grace  the lord is with thee   luke 1 28  and  blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb   luke 1 42 . the third part of the hail mary prayer is not from the bible  indeed  many believe that it exists in direct contradiction to scriptural truth   holy mary  mother of god  pray for us sinners  now and at the hour of our death. amen.    the first passage  luke 1 28  is the angel gabriel s greeting to mary. he said these words when he came to inform her that she had been chosen to bear the messiah. the second passage  luke 1 42  cites the greeting that mary s cousin elizabeth gave her when mary came to visit. elizabeth was also pregnant at the time   with john the baptist.

the budget  sending a mini baby bottle with the party info is unique and cute. you could also get plain white boxes and decorate as baby blocks  with the information inside. the sky is the limit           you don t have to send invitations through the mail  e invites work just as well  and they come in many cute designs. make your own invitations by buying pink and blue cardstock and handwriting or printing the information on them. include pink and blue confetti in the envelope.    make it clear that the event is a baby shower and be sure to include the name of the person it s being held for. in addition to these essential details  include the following info           the date of the shower. the place where it s being held. the start and end times. information about where the new mom is registered  this is only considered acceptable if you are not related to the mother. if you are related to her  it s not polite. you can also have registry information ready to give in print or over the phone  should anyone ask where the mom to be has registered . rsvp information or a regrets only request  so you know who s coming. give a date by which you d like to hear whether people can make it.    give people plenty of time to mark their calendars and plan ahead. you ll probably start receiving rsvps within a few days.           choose a character from a fairy tale  children s book  or cartoon. you could also choose baby animals  flowers  butterflies  or another fun  light hearted theme. find a party store in your area or search discount stores or the internet for plates  tablecloths  napkins  banners  balloons  favors and so on to match your theme or colors. decorative plates and napkins look so cute on the refreshment table.          matching the theme to the baby s nursery is a special idea that the mother to be will enjoy. if the sex of the baby is unknown  you could do a simple pink and blue theme.    streamers and helium balloons around the room and on the gift and refreshment tables are very festive and inexpensive to put up yourself. baby playthings such as rubber duckies  stuffed animals  or blocks make great decorative accents to place around the room. welcome guests and the mother to be to the shower in a special way with a baby shower banner and balloons at the shower entrance. if you have a publisher program on your computer you may be able to make a banner yourself.          dollar stores are excellent places to pick up inexpensive items. you may also want to look into renting a lawn stork with a sign announcing the anticipated arrival of the baby. another idea is to place a framed photo of the parents to be on the gift table for a personal touch. be sure to provide the mother to be with her own special chair next to the gifts and mark it by tying a unique balloon to it  or a sash announcing her soon to be status...she could even wear this while opening gifts  .    start with an inexpensive basket in natural  white  or another color that matches the shower colors. place a stuffed animal  doll or other item that coordinates with the shower theme into the basket and then place a baby bottle or rattle in front of the animal or doll. attach a decorative bow to the the basket handle and tie 4 5 pastel helium balloons to the top of the basket handle. place the decorated centerpiece in the middle of the refreshment or punch table and sprinkle around some baby shower confetti.          as a special gift  give the decorative centerpiece to the mother to be as a memento of her baby shower or to display in the baby s nursery.  diaper cakes also make very cute and functional centerpieces and double as a baby gift. you can make one yourself or find a diaper cake company that will create one that matches your shower theme. a simple fresh floral arrangement featuring the shower colors makes an elegant and appropriate centerpiece as well.    prepare a variety of snacks and desserts for your menu. you could simply have cake and punch or you can prepare a more elaborate spread. if your shower falls during lunch or dinner time you may want to provide a more substantial menu than just dessert.          finger foods are easy to prepare and the choice of finger foods is endless. pigs in a blanket  miniature ham biscuits  mini quiches  assorted finger sandwiches of meat and cheese or chicken egg salad croissants are always great options. prepare either a fruit or fresh vegetable tray and serve with a delicious dip. strawberries and grapes make good fruit selections because they require no cutting up. you can round out your shower menu with small snack items such as chips n dip  snack mix  assorted cubed cheeses and crackers  nuts  mints or whatever else you can think of that your guests would like. if you have a specialty dish or dessert  make it for the shower.    make your own punch using sherbet and ginger ale  or buy a prepared frozen punch starter from the ice cream section of your grocery store and simply add ginger ale. float a couple of small rubber duckies in the punch bowl for a truly fun accent  serve the punch in goblets for a more elegant touch. you will probably want to have some chilled bottled water  coffee or diet drinks available for guests who would prefer.           cake is a baby shower staple. special ordering a cake for a group can be expensive  so baking your own cake or cupcakes from a box mix and canned icing then decorating them with simple colored candy sprinkles or decorative cupcake picks is a less costly option.          display your decorated cupcakes by placing them on a footed cake plate scattered with candy sprinkles and add a cute figurine or rubber ducky in the center. a cheesecake sampler is a good alternative to your standard cake  especially for a small number of guests. these are found in most supermarket bakeries.    games are a good way to get the guests involved and break the ice. a mix of active and written games is good. you can create your own written games such as  unscramble the baby words   match the baby to the celebrity mother   or see how many words you can make out of the mother and father s names. remember to supply pens or pencils to your guests for written games. prizes can be inexpensive items such as candles  scented lotions  boxes of candy  cute stationary  gift cards or lottery tickets.          some more active games are  baby hot potato  where you pass a baby doll around a circle while you play a lullaby. whoever is holding the baby when the music stops is out. keep going until one person is left. baby bingo is fun and can be found at most party stores or you can get creative and make your own cards with a computer. this is played like regular bingo except the numbers are replaced with baby related words. for  diaper a doll while blind folded  all you need is a doll  a diaper and safety pins and a dark blind fold.  baby bottle drink off  is a hilarious game.  put about an ounce of punch  water or some other drink in baby bottles and have party participants race to drink their bottle. first person to finish wins. another really fun game that will be memorable is  baby sculptures . assign each participant a baby related item such as bottle  pacifier  baby s first tooth  or another small item and have them make it out of playdoh. the person who guesses the most correct sculptures wins.    have a few party favors to send home with the shower attendees. chocolate kisses or pastel candies wrapped in colored tulle and tied with ribbon along with a personalized tag make classic and low cost favors. design and print your own tags using your computer.          a really fun and original favor that doubles as a game are scratch off tickets that are printed with the mother to be s name and shower date. each person gets a ticket to scratch off with one ticket as a winner. guests who don t win still have a personalized keepsake from the shower.

query	45	become a f1 driver formula one become an f1 driver  this is the quickest way to find out if formula 1 is right for you. it is ideal for older racers that are new to the sport. you will get to get behind the wheel of a formula 1 race car and learn some of the basics of racing.these classes may have a substantial fee for a few hours of racing knowledge  but it is the most affordable way to gain knowledge about formula 1 racing before you decide to make a larger financial commitment.   you must have a valid standard driver s license to take these classes  and if you are a minor you will also need parental consent. you must be capable of driving a car with a manual transmission to take racing classes.    these programs will involve approximately 1 2 weeks of advanced classes to hone your racing skills. since your goal is to race in formula one  you likely want to select a school that is approved by the licensing organization.    upon completion of the required courses your school will send a letter of recommendation to a racing organization. this will enable you to register and compete in a racing school event.    these entry level race events are a great opportunity for amateur drivers to showcase their skills and get the attention of potential sponsors. some schools hold their own races and will even provide you a car for these race events. you can win scholarships and race points towards getting your next level license.    this method is the best way for younger racers to get involved in the sport. most of the top formula 1 drivers all started off racing carts. buying a kart can be costly  so you may just want to visit a local kart track and try it out first.    some organizations will give any beginner that applies a license so they can start entry level races to learn the sport. to get into more serious races  you will need to continue to apply for higher licenses. you may need to pass a test given at an accredited school  or show proficiency at racing at your current level before being allowed to move up.    if you are going to race you need some wheels. there are different vehicles for different levels of race  and you will probably need to buy or rent several karts before you move up to racing cars.  placing well in races is a big part in how quickly your racing career advances. the better you perform the sooner you will reach the next level. if you plan on getting to formula 1  you will need to race as much as you can and always be looking to move up to the next level.    formula 1 requires drivers to have a good deal of experience driving similar vehicles. while there are many possible race series that can be your path to formula 1  all racers must go through one or more of the junior levels to move up.  formula 1 racers must all be a minimum age to hold a license. some younger racers are good enough to be considered for formula 1  but will not be eligible until they reach the proper age. if you are still too young  look at gaining some more experience in any of the junior single seater race series to add to your race points.    these points are acquired based on performance and placement in junior race series events. 40 points must be acquired over a 3 year period to be eligible to get your formula 1 license.    to be eligible to hold the racing license you need to have a good handle on driving the car. these hours can be logged doing practice laps or test drives for car manufacturers.    if you have performed well as an amateur an owner might ask for you to drive for their team. these teams are often owned by car companies and have their own sponsorships to cover costs. they usually sign their drivers on a season to season basis.    most formula 1 drivers have some sponsors that require additional work off the track. to attract sponsors you need to have success on the track and a positive public opinion. you may have to do appearances or photo shoots for your sponsor in addition to your on track work. racing is a very expensive sport  so drivers must look to add to supplement their racing income whenever possible.    pay drivers are common in many levels of motorsports  including formula 1. instead of being paid by the race team  the driver uses money from sponsorships or their personal fortune to fund the racing operations.while this isn t practical for most new racers in formula 1  it is an option if you have the ability to pay for it.  
query	46	attend ceremony graduation find a graduation dress  some schools may prohibit strapless or spaghetti strapped dresses. if this is the case  don t look for graduation dresses that would violate the dress code. check with a teacher  professor or prior graduate  if you re unsure of where to find a handbook.    if you graduate in the spring  you may not want to wear a wool  sweater dress. besides that  you may get toasty in the graduation auditorium with loads of people. cotton  silk and rayon are all light weight fabrics good for spring. if you happen to be graduating in the fall  choose thick cotton or cotton blends  which will still breathe under your robe.linen is a great fabric for extra hot humid months  because of its superior breathability. wool is great in cold weather  because it will insulate yet breathe.    you will find a huge variety of places to shop for dresses. this includes everywhere from discount chain stores to specialty boutiques that sell wedding dresses too. you can find the right dress no matter where you shop  but keeping your budget in mind can help narrow down the playing field. remember that different department stores have

hundred dollars. boutique dress shops are for when money is no object.    most dresses are going to look best right above or below the knee on graduation day. if you happen to have a formal dinner or celebration after the ceremony  you may look at longer dresses  but make sure they are not too long. you wouldn t want to trip on your way to the stage.    keep your graduation colors in mind as you shop for dresses. just because most of it will be covered  doesn t mean hemlines or necklines can t peek out. choose a color that will match your school colors  so it will look nice in pictures and with or without the robe on. do not wear a hot pink dress with an orange cap.    in all actuality  it will be your shoes that will be seen the most on your walk to stage. pick your shoes out first and match your dress to them. make sure you can walk comfortably and match not only the color of your dress  but the style to them. wedges may match with a light colored  flirty dress  while black  leather pumps may be better with a sheath dress.  don t stress yourself out by shopping for a graduation dress at the last minute. start looking as soon as you can  preferably a few months ahead of time. you ll be able to weigh your options  stay on budget  and find one that perfectly flatters you.  sometimes it s hard to decide on important things like a graduation dress on your own. a close friend or relative can tell you what looks good and what doesn t. use your own judgement first  but they can point things out about fit and colors you may not normally notice.   take along fellow graduates  if you can. this will prevent you from choosing the same dress.    online dress shops often have a wide selection. use filters to narrow down your choices. filter by choices like style  cut  print  length  or occasion. some online shops even have selections specifically for graduation day. review the return policy before you buy in case you don t like a dress  after you try it on.  the

on graduation day. skip the clubwear and opt for a semi formal or casual dress that is cute  yet leaves room for the imagination.    graduation day rarely includes just a graduation ceremony. you will probably at least go to dinner with close friends and family. wear a summer dress for an outdoor graduation party  or a dress you can take out on the town to dance the night away.    the style of dress you decide on is going to have a lot to do with what looks good on your body type. you can minimize areas you re self conscious about  or emphasize parts of your body you re proud of. show off your hourglass figure with a belted or cinched waist. choose an empire waist  if you want your dress to flow loosely around a mid section.   play up curves with ruched fabric around the bust and hips. down play your bottom half with a dress fitted from the waist up and flared out below it. offset broad shoulders by wearing an a line dress that flares out slightly at the waist.  necklines of dresses come in as much variety as the cut. if you have special jewelry for graduation day  like your grandmother s pearl necklace  you definitely need to decide on a neckline. you may want a scalloped or v neck to show it off. choose no neckline at all with a strapless dress and wear a statement necklace.go conservative with a high neckline. a little cleavage is fine  but don t go overboard.    the best way to feel good in what you re wearing is by showing off your style and personality. be feminine with ruffles and bows. be chic in something simple and dark. be glamorous with touches of sparkle or sequins. wearing a dress that helps express your individual style will keep you glowing on graduation day.  sometimes you may find the perfect dress  but need the waist or bust taken in. the fit of a dress is important. make sure you go to a well reviewed seamstress for measurements and alterations. they can put the final touches on a dress to help you feel your best.
query	47	recommend honeymoon plan your honeymoon  take the time to discuss with your future spouse what the two of you would like. plan something that fits your budget and that you both can agree on. compromise  because this is a trip about both of you.   fall is the least expensive time of year to travel. travel deals are easiest to find in the fall because just about every destination is  on sale  in the fall. once labor day hits  the tourist season winds down and stays slow until christmas. travel when it s least expensive. to avoid paying the most for your trip  avoid the week between christmas and new year s. starting about december 16th and until january 3rd  the rates are highest for  fun in the sun  places  and ski destinations. the next time to avoid  the week leading up to easter sunday   almost as bad as christmas for getting  gouged  on the price. spring break happens at different times throughout the world  from about the mid march to    also  avoid thanksgiving week like the plague. if planning a short getaway  avoid all government holidays  such as columbus day and president s day. due to the number of federal employees that get this time off  demand is higher and prices rise.   pick  hidden holidays  for traveling  especially since you might want to be away from the touristy crowds on your honeymoon  not all holidays drive up the price of travel. there are even some that are ideal to travel since pricing is lower than normal. when you think a bit about people s habits  it starts to make sense. the week of memorial day is a good one. it s the first bbq holiday of the year and most people want to stay home and gather with friends and family. mother s day and father s day are slow travel weekends  because being away keeps lots of people home forcing hotels and airlines to reduce prices to induce people to leave loved ones behind. labor day weekend is the best holiday weekend for finding a bargain in travel  since the focus is on  back to school.     if you dream about going  somewhere different  that not every one else has gone to for their honeymoon   there is a reason why. such places are always harder to reach from where you live and require a commitment to spend additional time traveling to get there. are you committed enough to your dream destination to take a connecting flight  are you committed enough to spend 12 or 14 hours getting to this place  with all the cutbacks in flights  the number of nonstop schedules have dwindled making it much harder to get to  some place different.     you can get off the well worn path and delve into nearby areas that offer the unique and unusual setting you crave  and all for a lot less than you d pay for places that take an entire day to reach. for example  one of the easiest beach destinations to reach is cancun  mexico  but for many  it s not unusual enough. consider flying into cancun and taking the ferry to the island of isla mujeres to stay at a resort that can only be reached by boat.    some good ideas are bike tours around the city  so you can even go to the less explored or reachable areas  pottery or sculpting classes and even home run cooking classes or dining with locals.  you only want to plan one honeymoon  so make sure you do it right. a good travel consultant will seldom cost more than if you  do it yourself   but can often save you money. they have an insider s knowledge about the fares and deals that are circulating around. they know how to get you  wholesale  prices for your honeymoon. they have contacts for problem resolutions that you are not likely to have. they know the places to avoid and the places that are the best in their category. a good travel consultant wears many hats on your behalf. they act as a personal shopper  your accountant  and sometimes even a therapist when you need a shoulder to cry on    nan  you will find they range from the most basic  3 squares and a hot shower to limited gourmet dining and then to unlimited luxury where every possible option is yours to enjoy. note  some of the most heavily advertised all inclusive resorts are not the best deal or the best resorts. they just spend a lot to make themselves seem like they are. there are many hidden fees that your travel consultant knows about and can recommend to save you money and give you the best honeymoon possible   
query	48	apply for citizenship immigration obtain dual citizenship  were you born in a state whose right to citizenship you have never exercised  if so  then you might be eligible for citizenship through an unrestricted right of soil  also known as unconditional jus soli. this means that you have an automatic birthright to be a citizen of that country because you were born there. for example  if you are currently a british citizen who was born in the united states  you are entitled to american citizenship through unrestricted jus soli.research the immigration laws of your country of birth. most countries do not grant citizenship through right of soil  so it is important to research the laws of the country in which you were born.30 of the world s 194 countries practice unconditional jus soli.of these 30 countries  canada and the united states  as of 2010  are the only countries among the world s advanced economies that practice unconditional jus soli and grant citizenship to most children born on its soil  including children born to persons present in the state illegally.however  children born in the united states to foreign diplomats and foreign heads of state do not acquire citizenship through right of soil.    you may find that your country of birth  which is not the country whose citizenship rights you exercise  grants you a right to its citizenship through a right of soil. if so  discover how you can exercise that right.   one way to exercise a right to citizenship is to apply for a passport. you can apply for a passport through the state s embassy or consulate in your current country of citizenship and or residence. you may be asked to present an original or certified copy of your birth certificate to the consulate or embassy as evidence. for example  if you apply for a canadian passport  then you can present a birth certificate issued by the canadian province or territory in which you were born. this serves as evidence of your canadian citizenship because canada practices unrestricted jus soli.  find out the laws regarding dual citizenship of both the state of your current citizenship and of the state whose second citizenship you are trying to obtain. consider whether enforcing your right of soil citizenship may require renouncing your current citizenship. this is important because not all states that practice unconditional jus soli permit their citizens to hold dual citizenship.   for example  pakistan practices unconditional jus soli  with a few minor exceptions  but only permits dual citizenship with a select number of states.examples of countries that both practice unconditional jus soli and permit dual citizenship are the united states and canada.  most countries in the world grant citizenship on the basis of right of blood or jus sanguinis. under the jus sanguinis principle  you acquire one or both of your parents  citizenship upon birth.this means that the child acquires the parents  citizenship regardless of where she is born  and her only citizenship is the one acquired through right of blood if she is born in a country that does not practice jus soli.   for example  if you were born in the united states  but your parents are both british citizens  then you are also a british citizen.    find out if obtaining a second citizenship through the jus sanguinis principle of a state would require you to renounce your prior citizenship. if that is the case  you cannot become a dual citizen.   both the united states and the united kingdom permit dual citizenship. however  there are other countries that grant citizenship on the jus sanguinis principle and do not permit dual citizenship.singapore  for example  practices jus sanguinis but does not allow dual citizenship.  the process that you will need to follow to gain citizenship through parentage will vary by country. check with the country s consulate to determine what you will need to do.   for example  if you are currently an american citizen who was born to british parents  and you are under the age of 18  it is your parents who must apply on your behalf to register you as a british citizen. the application form and guidance on how to register as a british citizen in this scenario are available here.    many countries issue resident visas or permits to individuals who are willing to invest in the country s economy  and those resident visas can make you eligible for citizenship after a few years. this can be an expensive route as the minimum investment amounts range from several hundred thousand dollars to several million dollars.for example  the united states requires an investment of  1 million  or  500 000 if you are investing in a high unemployment or rural area   and in return you receive a conditional permanent resident permit.  this path to citizenship can take a long time  so research the amount of time that it will take you to become a citizen before you decide to invest.   for example  the united states and belgium grant citizenship after five years of holding a resident permit of this type. however  malta  whose minimum investment requirement is eur 1 million  grants citizenship after only 1 year.    some states that grant investor visas also require that you remain a resident in that state before you can become a citizen. however  not all countries have residency requirements.   for example  cyprus does not have a residency requirement but the united states does.  not all countries permit dual citizenship. you may be required to renounce your prior citizenship in order to acquire citizenship by investment. if that is the case  you cannot become a dual citizen in this way.    if you are married to someone who holds a citizenship that you do not  then you might consider whether your spouse s country of citizenship grants you citizenship by marriage. this process involves applying for a resident permit that you would qualify for based on your marriage. you would also need to meet any residency requirements.   if you believe that you can acquire a second citizenship through marriage  research the laws of your spouse s country of citizenship regarding citizenship by this route. the laws about the application process and amount of time involved to obtain citizenship will vary by country. for example  if you are married to a british citizen  you must meet certain requirements before you can apply to become a british citizen by marriage. you must be 18 years of age or older  of sound mind  of good character  e.g. you don t have a serious criminal record   you must meet english language requirements and show knowledge of life in the uk  you must have been granted indefinite permission to stay in the uk  and you must meet a residency requirement.  note that entering into a sham or fake marriage for the sole purpose of acquiring residency and  subsequent citizenship  of your spouse s country is considered fraud and is a serious criminal offense in most countries. do not attempt to enter into a sham marriage for the purpose of becoming a dual citizen  as the legal consequences of this can be severe.  not all countries permit dual citizenship  and your spouse s country of citizenship may be one that requires you to renounce your previous citizenship. if that is the case  then you cannot become a dual citizen through marriage.    you may also gain citizenship by applying for a job in another country. some countries allow individuals who have legally entered the country on a work visa to convert their visa status to permanent residency and then to citizenship.   for example  in australia you can apply for a number of categories of employment visas that have their own requirements. one type is called a skilled independent visa and it allows you to enter australia with the intention of working in australia as long as you meet the criteria. if you spend four consecutive years in australia under the visa  then you become eligible for australian citizenship.  in many countries  the first step to becoming a citizen is to apply for residency. once you become a resident  you may then apply for citizenship through naturalization. eligibility requirements vary from country to country.   for example  in the united states you can qualify for permanent residency through the diversity immigrant visa program. this program randomly draws from a pool of individuals who are from countries with low rates of immigration to the united states.check to see if the country in which you are interested in acquiring a second citizenship has a similar route to acquiring residency. once you acquire residency and meet any other criteria  then you can apply for citizenship.    keep in mind that not all countries permit dual citizenship. if you acquire citizenship of a state through a work visa  visa lottery  or other program  then you may be required to renounce your prior citizenship. if that is the case  you cannot become a dual citizen by following this route.

the gate of a secured building and appeared to be trying to gain access. he was about 5 11  was wearing black pants and a black jacket  and appeared to be between 30 40 years old. he seemed agitated and nervous so i thought it best to report what i saw.     if you have strong suspicions that terrorist activity is taking place  submit a tip online to the federal authorities. online reports will be viewed by an agent or another professional staff member of the organization and handled accordingly. to report an immediate threat  find the number for your local federal security office and contact it as soon as possible.   in the u.s.  visit the fbi website at https   tips.fbi.gov  to fill out a form for tips and public leads  which will require your name  location  contact information  and a detailed description of the suspicious activity that you witnessed.  if you suspect that a breach to cyber security has occurred  e.g. an attempt to gain unauthorized access to a secured system or its data  report it to local authorities. finance and power systems are especially vulnerable to cyber terrorism  but security fixes and upgrades are increasingly being mounted to lower the risk of such attacks. reporting potential threats may aid with these measures.if you are a u.s. resident you may also report your suspicions to the united states computer emergency readiness team  a division of the u.s. department of homeland security. visit the organization s website at https   www.us cert.gov forms report to submit a report.    extreme poverty can cause a low standard of life  a sense of disenfranchisement  and a lack of opportunities. this lack of choices and hope sometimes creates a feeling of desperation that leaves young people vulnerable to recruitment by terrorist groups. support charities that fight poverty on a global level  such as unicef k.i.d.s.  kids in distressed situations  interaction action against hunger    discrimination can cause unrest  distrust  and anger  all of which may create an environment where terrorism becomes more likely. do your best to fight discrimination within your community on a day to day basis by being aware of it  denouncing it  and declining to associate with individuals who perpetuate hate against specific demographics of people. be considerate in your dialogue and treatment of others.for instance  if you observe discrimination of a client or customer by an employee of a business or other organization  report the incident to their superiors as soon as possible to ensure that they will be held accountable for their behaviour.    while terrorism might seem like a huge  overwhelming phenomenon  efforts to make small scale social improvements can help in the larger fight against it. radicalization cannot be traced to one common cause  but it is attributed to both  push factors   e.g. marginalization  inequality  discrimination  and  pull factors   e.g. the appeal of extremist groups  who offer a feeling of inclusion and an outlet for grievances . reach out to marginalized colleagues  peers  and acquaintances who may be feeling isolated to help foster a stronger  more inclusive sense of community.for instance  invite marginalized colleagues out for group lunches or other activities. reach out to uneasy or isolated new neighbours by making a kind gesture  bringing over a gift or offering to help with an outdoor task  e.g. shovelling the driveway .    the goal of terrorism is to spread fear  so help overcome its paralyzing effects by keeping terror statistics in perspective. the odds of a u.s. citizen being killed in a terror attack are approximately one in twenty million  taking into account both home and overseas incidents. keep this information in mind and share it when family  friends  or colleagues express anxiety about the threat of terrorist attacks.  to really make an impact in the war against terrorism  pursue a counterterrorism career. government agencies provide a wide variety of job opportunities in the field  while public and private organizations offer numerous positions in counterintelligence. the jobs may include criminal investigators intelligence analysts special forces business intelligence analysts loss prevention managers fraud examiners  investigators and analysts

is a valuable tool you can use to better understand an event or historical period.even though real people may or may not be involved in historical fiction about the vietnam war  these tales can often explore what it felt like to fight in or endure the war in ways that nonfiction cannot. in the case of the vietnam war  there are numerous novels  plays  and films about the conflict.   some of the most popular films about the war include born on the fourth of july  casualties of war  and full metal jacket. some of the most popular novels about the war include the short timers and matterhorn.    there is a world of nonfiction about the vietnam war. some of these books are memoirs  others are biographies of significant people  and others are more wide ranging histories about the roots

talk about. for instance  do not ask   how many people did you kill   or say  i would have killed many enemy soldiers.  these statements might make veterans uncomfortable or even angry. for similar reasons  do not say to a vet   i m glad you made it home okay.  even if veterans are physically unharmed  they might feel a great deal of psychic pain and emotional frustration about what they did or saw in vietnam. start with easy questions like   when did you serve in vietnam   and work your way up through more difficult questions like   did you see many battles   arrange a meeting with a vietnam vet in your area by contacting vietnam veterans against the war or the wounded warriors project to learn more about the military experience of the war.    during the vietnam war  civilians suffered terribly.their experiences can help you understand how people who lived through the war talked and thought about it. prepare a list of questions you want to ask before beginning your conversation.   find out where the civilian lived during the war. people who lived in north vietnam will likely remember the conflict differently than people who lived in south vietnam. you might want to ask about the attitude toward the war and how it changed over time.    the cold war was the ongoing conflict between the 20th century s two great superpowers  the u.s. and the u.s.s.r. the u.s. was a capitalist democracy  while the u.s.s.r. was a communist dictatorship. the two nations saw each other as mortal enemies. instead of fighting each other directly  though  they fought a series of indirect proxy wars and conflicts around the world in vietnam  nicaragua  cuba  angola  and elsewhere.china was the other emerging superpower  and it officially sided with the u.s.s.r.  though the two countries often disagreed. china and the u.s.s.r. both aided north vietnam. ask a grandparent  or parent  if they are old enough to remember  what the cold war was like. ask questions like   what did americans think of the u.s.s.r.   or  did you know anyone who fought in vietnam      vietnam had a long history of colonization. in the 1800s  france took over indochina  what is today vietnam  laos  and cambodia . during world war ii  they were pushed out by japan  who then instituted an even more brutal colonization regime  resulting in the starvation of around 2 million vietnamese people.france took over again briefly after world war ii ended  but struggled to maintain control  and left in 1954 after their defeat in the battle of dien bien phu.   when france left  the peace treaty divided the country into two parts  north vietnam and south vietnam . elections and reunification were scheduled  but did not occur. in 1959  north vietnam declared war on the south. vietnam s struggle for unity and independence was part of a global struggle against colonial rule. india  algeria  and indonesia all fought anti colonial wars following world war ii. learning about colonization in vietnam will help you understand why the vietnamese were so suspicious and opposed to american intervention in their country.    in 1964  two american battleships reported they had been fired upon by north vietnam. following these alleged attacks  president lyndon johnson sought approval to expand american military presence in vietnam. after this incident  american involvement in vietnam began to increase.later reports revealed that there had been a small conflict between u.s. and north vietnamese forces several days before the incident that president johnson suggested demanded military response. later  it was discovered that american ships had not been fired upon during this incident.    the gulf of tonkin incident caused president johnson to increase the number of u.s. troops in vietnam. by 1967 there were about half a million u.s. troops in the country.one of the major turning points was the tet offensive  a large scale military against u.s. and south vietnamese forces. after the attack  americans increasingly believed that they could not win the war and that new leadership was needed to take america out of vietnam.    as the war dragged on  it became less and less popular.president johnson s high disapproval due to his stance on the war led him to decline seeking re election in 1968. richard nixon was then elected president on a platform that promised to end the war. finally  in 1973  american forces withdrew. north vietnam finally prevailed over south vietnam in 1975  and the country was reunified.    the vietnam war was very unpopular. as more and more u.s. soldiers died  americans began to question the validity of the war. many americans dodged the draft by going to canada or getting married in order to avoid military service in what they considered a pointless conflict. others protested the war by marching and engaging in anti war actions. college campuses were hotbeds of antiwar activity.   many people publicly burned their draft cards in opposition to the war. at kent state university in 1970  army national guardsmen fired on students during an anti war protest. four students died and nine were wounded.try to imagine yourself being shot at by your own country s military simply for exercising your freedom of speech. how would you feel  in order to understand the vietnam war  it is important to consider why it was so unpopular. compare reactions to the vietnam war to reactions to world war ii. how were they different and why     the war was equally unpopular in vietnam. america gave support to the government of south vietnam  but that government was very unpopular. one of the most visible symbols of vietnamese opposition to their own government    and  by extension  their allies and the war   was when thich quang duc burned himself alive in saigon in 1963.  the war was unique in a few ways. it used new kinds of weapons  napalm and agent orange  and was fought against a different kind of enemy.to fully understand the civilian response  it is important to understand these unique aspects.   napalm was a flammable liquid that caused massive burns across anything it touched. during the vietnamese war  it was used extensively by the u.s. to burn forests where enemy soldiers were hiding  but it also caused many civilian deaths. agent orange was a chemical weapon developed by two companies  dow chemical and the monsanto corporation. this chemical caused widespread birth defects  immune deficiency  and an increased rate of cancer for the vietnamese people. it also produced adverse health impacts for u.s. soldiers who were exposed. traditional wars involve two armies facing off on a battlefield. this rarely occurred in vietnam. instead  american soldiers had to contend with guerrillas   soldiers who did not wear uniforms and who would attack small groups of soldiers from a distance  rather than engage them in direct battle. many of these guerillas moved freely between north and south vietnam. guerrillas also used traps and mines to cause damage to american soldiers without confronting them directly.    unlike prior conflicts  americans saw the impact of the vietnam war directly each night on tv. as the war dragged on  support declined as audiences saw firsthand the horrors of the war. understanding the war requires recognizing the impact of tv footage on american attitudes.

of water depth below you. research the area you re planning to jump off and also check out the guidelines put in place by the world high diving federation because they have some very useful height and depth measurements that they have calculated to reduce risks.also ask boaters  expert jumpers who have already jumped the relevant cliff  marina or tourist staff  and other people who would have knowledge about the cliff and its suitability for diving off. if it s already a place where people jump off successfully  that may be a good reassurance or may give you cause to pause if you learn otherwise. see  tips  for famous cliff diving locations.   be aware of the laws regarding the cliff. if it s a tourist attraction like la quebrada  you can be certain that no tourist will actually be allowed to perform a dive. and if it s a known diving location  there may be warning signs or requirements in place that you need to know about. ask around before assuming anything. check out access to the cliff. unless you re diving in shoes  see next step   you may be clambering up a rocky cliff face in bare feet and you ll need to know which access routes the experienced cliff divers usually use.    for a cliff jump under 30 feet  wear a secure and aerodynamic bathing suit  avoid anything flimsy or flapping and definitely have nothing that s over sized. remember   this gear has to stay on when you land in that water    for cliffs over 30 feet  it is best to jump in soft cloth shorts and have tennis shoes on your feet. goggles are not recommended during a jump as they will fly off when you hit the water. some advice suggests that a wetsuit is best because it provides impact cushioning between your skin and the water as you hit it. preferably  don t wear glasses but contacts are permissible if you re good at keeping your eyes shut until you surface.    find a pair of excellent goggles and a snorkel for the checking crew to wear. have at least two snorkelers swim underneath the cliff you intend to jump off as  spotters  for possible dangers. they will examine the area for hidden rocks  branches  limbs  or other projections that could cause you harm when you jump and hit the water. while snorkeling  identify a location that will allow jumpers to climb back out of the water and to the top of the cliff again.   an example of a landing danger is shown by la quebrada s unique situation. the cliff dive here can only be undertaken at high tide and even then the dive must end when an incoming wave pushes up the water to its highest point in the inlet  that kind of precision takes years of training and care and isn t something you can just jump into unawares.    are there any snags  parts jutting out  or other possible obstacles that could break your fall or throw you off course  be sure to avoid any cliff that has such problems because they increase the risk tremendously. another thing to check for is the safest way back to shore  avoiding rocks and riptides  etc.   also look for wind problems. everything may look great but certain features might cause wind problems that could slam you back into the cliff. ask experts who have dived off that cliff first. is there wildlife hanging about  even hitting a fish can cause injury but hitting a dolphin  whale or seal will definitely cause problems. avoid any area teeming with wildlife.    diving off a cliff is not only dangerous because of the cliff itself and the water below but also because of the speed of impact. a jump from 20 feet  6 meters  above water will cause you to hit the water at 25 mph  40 kph  and that can compress your spine  break your bones or cause concussion.the world high diving federation recommends that no cliff dives of 65.5 feet  20 meters  or higher take place without professional scuba divers being positioned in the water.before you attempt a cliff dive   can you dive  it s foolhardy to be jumping off a cliff not knowing the basic principles of a safe and good dive technique and to know how it feels to dive. it s recommended that you practice diving off high diving platforms at the local pool before trying cliff diving. and this should also be done under supervision until you know what you re doing   diving at any height is dangerous when you don t know how to do it properly.    you will need to propel yourself off the cliff using your knees as a propulsion unit. falling off the cliff is dangerous as you may hit the side on your way down. jumping away from the surface will keep you away from the side of the cliff and protect you from harm.   start by standing erect  with feet together  arms raised straight above your head and bend your knees. bring your arms down  then back to hip level and sweep them forward as you drive forward with your legs. leap straight out with your body facing perpendicular to the water. while still perpendicular to the water  arch your back and as you do so  gravity will pull you to the vertical position. in the air  you will need to be as straight as possible  like a pencil . once gravity has pulled you to this position  bring your arms over your head and place your right hand in a fist with your left locked over it  or vice versa if preferred . jump staying straight  with your toes pointed to the water at all times. enter the water vertically  perpendicular to the surface. do not aim to land on your face  stomach  or bottom as this can incur severe damage if you do.    when you hit the water  stretch your legs and arms out and arch your back. this will keep you from going too deep into the water. swim to the top and then find your predetermined location to climb back up    if people are watching  give them a wave to let them know you re okay.   nan

query	56	debug php write php scripts  this is the program you will be using write and edit your code.   notepad can be accessed on any version of windows using   win   r   notepad. textedit can be accessed on mac by going to applications   textedit.    a section of php code begins and ends with bracketed php tags     php       .  echo  is a very basic statement  an instruction to the computer  in the php language that will output text to the screen. the text you want to echo must be enclosed in quotation marks and end in a semi colon.   the code should look something like   php echo  hello world      .    this is done by navigating to file   save as...   in notepad  add .php to the end of the filename and enclose in double quotations. this ensures the file will not be converted into a basic text file by notepad. without the quotation marks  the file will become hello world.php.txt. alternatively  you can select the drop down menu under save as type and change it to  all files   .    which will leave the name exactly how you type it and the quotes will not be needed. in textedit  no quotations marks are necessary  but a popup will appear asking you to verify that you want the file saved as .php. make sure you save the file to your  server s  document root directory. typically this is the folder named  htdocs  in your apache folder on windows  or  library webserver documents on mac  but can be set by the user manually.    open your preferred web browser and type this address in the address bar using the name of your php file  http   localhost hello world.php. your browser window should display the echo statement.   if you receive an error message  make sure you typed the code correctly as shown above  including the colon. also make sure that your file is saved into the correct directory.    the    php  and      tags tell the php engine that everything between them is php code. everything outside the two tags is treated as html and ignored by the php engine and sent to your browser the same as any other html. the important thing to recognize here is that php scripts are embedded inside regular html pages.    statements are used to tell the php engine to do something. in the case of an echo statement  you are telling the engine to print what is inside the quotes.   the php engine itself never actually prints anything to your screen. any output generated by the engine is sent to your browser as html. your browser does not know that it s getting php output. as far as the browser is concerned  it s getting plain html.    adding html tags can alter the output of the php statement. the   strong      strong   tags will add bold formatting to any text placed inside of them. note that these tags appear on the outside of the text  but inside of the quotations marks of the echo statement.   you want your code to look something like    php  echo   strong hello world   strong          go to file   save as  and save the file as  helloworld2.php   and open it in your browser by using the address  http   localhost helloworld2.php. the output is the same as before  but this time the text is in bold.   make sure you save the file to your  server s  document root directory. typically this is the folder named  htdocs  in your apache folder on windows  or  library webserver documents on osx  but can be set by the user manually.    remember  statements need to be separated by a semicolon.   your code should look something like    php echo  hello world   br   echo  how are you doing          the page will display two echo statements  listed in order  on two lines. notice the   br   on the first line. this is html markup to insert a line break.   if you didn t add this  your output would look like this  hello world how are you doing     to manipulate data  be it numbers or names  you need to store the data in a container. this process is called declaring the variable. the syntax for declaring a variable is   myvariable    hello world       the dollar sign     at the beginning tells php that  myvariable is a variable. all variables must start with the dollar sign  but the name of the variable can be anything. in the above example  the value is  hello world    and the variable is  myvariable. you re telling php to store the value at the right of the equal sign  into the variable at the left of the equal sign. a variable containing a text value is known as a string.    referring to a variable in the code is known as a call. declare your variable  then echo the variable instead of typing out the text.   your code might look something like    php   myvariable    hello world    echo  myvariable        go to file   save as  and save the file as  myfirstvariable.php . open your browser and navigate to http   localhost myfirstvariable.php and the script will print the variable. the output looks the same as printing plain text  but how it was achieved is different.   make sure you save the file to your  server s  document root directory. typically this is the folder named  htdocs  in your apache folder on windows  or  library webserver documents on osx  but can be set by the user manually.    variables can also contain numbers  known as integers   and then those numbers can be manipulated using simple mathematical functions. start by declaring three variables called   mysmallnumber     mylargenumber   and   mytotal .   your code should look something like    php  mysmallnumber   mylargenumber   mytotal        give an integer value to   mysmallnumber  and  mylargenumber .   note that integer values do not need to be contained in quotation marks. that will cause numbers to be treated as a text value like the  hello world   variable. your code should look something like    php  mysmallnumber   12   mylargenumber   356   mytotal        rather than doing the math yourself  you can call the two variables in the   mytotal  variable. using a mathematical function  the machine will calculate the sum for you. to print the variable  you need only add an echo statement that calls the variable after the declaration.   any change to either integer variable would be reflected when printing the   mytotal  variable with echo. your code should look something like    php  mysmallnumber   12   mylargenumber   356   mytotal    mysmall number    mylargenumber  echo  mytotal        your browser window will display a single number. that number is the sum of the two variables called in the   mytotal  variable.    using a variable to store text allows you to call that variable any time you want to use the store value instead of constantly typing out the contained text. it also allows for more complex manipulation of the stored data moving forward.   the first variable   myvariable  contains a string value   hello world  . unless you change the value   myvariable will always contain the value  hello world  . the echo statement prints the contained value of  myvariable.    you have explored basic manipulation of integer variables by using a mathematical function. the resulting data can be stored into another variable. this is only the beginning of what can be accomplished with these variables.   the two variables   mysmallnumber  and  mylargenumber are each assigned an integer value. the third variable   mytotal  stores the added values of  mysmallnumber and  mylargenumber. since  mysmallnumber holds one numeric value  and  mylargenumber holds a second numeric value  this means  mytotal holds the value of the first number added to the second number. this value can change with alterations to either of the included variables.  
query	57	teach english grammar learn english grammar  every word in the english language can be categorized as a specific part of speech. the parts of speech do not define what a word is. instead  they describe how to use that word.   a noun is a person  place  or thing.example  grandma  school  pencil a pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun within a sentence. example  he  she  they  articles are special terms that proceed a noun within a sentence. the three articles are  a  an  the an adjective modifies or describes a noun or pronoun. example  red  tall a verb is a word that describes an action or state of being. example  be  run  sleep an adverb modifies or describes a verb. adverbs can also be used to modify adjectives. example  happily  wonderfully a conjunction joins two parts of a sentence together. example  and  but a preposition is used in combination with a noun or pronoun to create a phrase that modifies other parts of speech  like a verb  noun  pronoun  or adjective. example  up  down  of  from  interjections are words that express an emotional state. example  wow  ouch  hey    most parts of speech have additional rules governing their usage. if you want to master english grammar  you will need to study these rules in detail. make note of the following for your studies nouns can be  singular or plural  proper or common  collective  count or non count  abstract or concrete  gerunds pronouns can be  personal  possessive  reflexive  intensive  reciprocal  indefinite  demonstrative  interrogative  or relative adjectives can be used on their own  for the sake of making comparisons  or as superlatives. adverbs are either relative adverbs or adverbs of frequency. conjunctions are either coordinating or correlative. verbs can be  action verbs or linking verbs  main verbs or auxiliary helping verbs the articles  a  and  an  are indefinite  while the article  the  is definite.    single digit numbers  zero through nine  should be spelled out in word form  but double digit numbers  10 and up  should be written in numerical form.all numbers within a sentence should either be spelled out or written numerically. do not mix and match.  correct example  i bought 14 apples but my sister only bought 2 apples. incorrect example  i bought 14 apples but my sister only bought two apples.   never start a sentence with a number written in numerical form. spell out simple fractions and use hyphens with them. example  one half a mixed fraction can be written numerically. example  5 1 2 write decimals in numerical figures. example  0.92 use commas when writing numbers with four or more digits. example  1 234 567 write out the numerical figure when specifying the day of the month. example  june 1    at minimum  every sentence consists of a subject and an action. a sentence that lacks either one is a sentence fragment and is considered to be improper.   the subject is usually a noun or pronoun  and the action is conveyed using a verb. correct example  the dog ran.  note that the subject is indicated in italics and the action is indicated in bold print.   incorrect example  yesterday afternoon. expand your sentences into more complex forms after mastering this basic format.    within a sentence  both the subject and verb must share the same singular plural state. you cannot use the singular form of a verb with a plural subject  a plural subject must have a plural verb.correct example  they are at school. incorrect example  they is at school. when two singular subjects are connected with the word  and   he and his brother   the subject becomes plural. when connected by  or  or  nor   he or his brother   the subject is singular. collective nouns  like  family  or  team   are treated as singular nouns and require a singular verb.    compound sentences are the easiest sentence form to master after the basic sentence. use a conjunction to join two related thoughts into one sentence rather than forming two separate sentences.   instead of  the dog ran. he was fast.  use  the dog ran and he was fast.   instead of  we looked for the missing book. we could not find it.  use  we looked for the missing book but could not find it.      a conditional sentence describes a situation in which one part of the sentence is true only if the other part is true. they can also be referred to as  if  then  statements  but the word  then  will not always appear when the sentence is written.example  if you ask your mother  then she will take you to the store.  note  however  that it would also be correct to write  if you ask your mother  she will take you to the store. both forms are still conditional.      use clauses to form complex sentences. clauses are the  building blocks  that can be used to expand a sentence past its basic form. they can either be independent or dependent.an independent clause has its own subject and verb. as a result  it could stand as its own sentence. note that compound sentences  as mentioned previously  consist of independent clauses.  example  she felt sad  but her friends cheered her up.  both  she felt sad  and  her friends cheered her up  could stand as separate sentences.   a dependent clause is one that could not stand as its own sentence.  example  while he agreed with his brother  the boy would not admit to it.  the clause  while he agreed with his brother  would not make sense a separate sentence  so it is a dependent clause.      there are multiple punctuation marks and various rules governing their usage. you should study these rules in detail  but first  you need a basic understanding of how each punctuation mark is used.periods  .  mark the end of a statement sentence.  ellipses  ...  indicate that a portion of text has been removed from the passage.  commas     separate words or word groups when a pause is necessary but a period is inappropriate.  semicolons     should be used in complex sentences that lack a connecting conjunction.  colons     are used to introduce lists within a sentence.  question marks     are used at the end of a sentence when the sentence asks a question.  exclamation points     are used at the end of a statement sentence to indicate surprise or emphasis.  quotation marks     separate words spoken by another person from the rest of the text.  parentheses    enclose information that clarifies a preceding thought.  apostrophes     separate contractions and show possession.    a basic paragraph consists of three to seven sentences. each paragraph must have a topic sentence  supporting sentences  and a concluding sentence.the topic sentence is usually the first sentence in the paragraph. it is the most general sentence and introduces the idea you plan to discuss throughout the rest of the paragraph.  example  english grammar is a complex topic that covers a range of information.    the supporting sentences explain the idea presented in the topic sentence with greater detail.  example  english grammar is a complex topic that covers a range of information. at the  word  level  one must learn about parts of speech. at the  sentence  level  topics like sentence structure  subject verb agreement  and clauses must be explored. the rules governing punctuation use are also a part of  sentence  level grammar. once a person starts writing larger piece  he or she must also learn about paragraph structure and organization.    the concluding sentence summarizes the information presented in the paragraph. it is not always necessary  but you should still know how to write one.  example  english grammar is a complex topic that covers a range of information. at the  word  level  one must learn about parts of speech. at the  sentence  level  topics like sentence structure  subject verb agreement  and clauses must be explored. the rules governing punctuation use are also a part of  sentence  level grammar. once a person starts writing larger piece  he or she must also learn about paragraph structure and organization. all of these rules define and describe how to write english correctly.    also note that the first sentence of a paragraph should be indented a few spaces to the right of the paragraph s left edge.    while you could technically have a paragraph that uses nothing but basic sentences  a better and more grammatically pleasing paragraph will have a variety of simple and complex sentences.   correct example  i love my cat. he has soft  orange fur. on cold days  he likes to cuddle next to me for warmth. i think that my cat is the greatest cat ever  and i am really happy to have him. incorrect example  i love my cat. he is orange. his fur is soft. he cuddles next to me on cold days. my cat is the greatest cat. i am really happy to have him.    after you feel comfortable with your paragraph writing skills  try writing longer works  like academic essays. essay writing is a separate subject  so you should study about it in greater detail. there are a few things you should keep in mind as you begin  though.    organize your essay by writing an introductory paragraph  three or more body paragraphs  and a concluding paragraph. the introductory paragraph must be a general paragraph that presents the main idea without providing detail. the supporting paragraphs must expand on this main idea with greater detail  and each paragraph should cover its own separate point. the concluding paragraph restates and summarizes the information presented in the essay and does not introduce any new information.    the rules and information provided in this article will not teach you everything you need to know about english grammar. this article is intended to serve as a starting point in your studies. the actual subject of english grammar is much more complex  and you will need to devote a lot of time and effort if you really want to learn it.    some aspects will be similar while others will differ.   when the rules are the same  rely on the knowledge you have of your native grammar to help you with english grammar. when the rules differ  devote more time and concentration on practicing those aspects of english grammar as you study.    people who do a lot of reading tend to be more proficient with english grammar in their own writing and speech.   this does not refer to grammar books. grammar books are helpful  of course  but the principle of this step is a different one. read books  magazines  or other materials written in english that you enjoy. the more often you read  the more familiar you will naturally become with the way that grammar is used in word  sentence  and paragraph levels. learning the rules of english grammar is an important step  but you will be able to put those rules into practice better if you are actually used to seeing proper grammar.    if you are no longer in school  consider taking a grammar class at a community college  community center  or library. you could also look for a class online.   for non native english speakers  look for classes specifically designed for students who are learning english as a secondary language. these classes are usually labeled as esl  english as a second language   enl  english as a new language   or esol  english for speakers of other languages  classes.    if formal classes do not help  find a mentor who can review grammar rules with you one on one. this mentor could be a teacher  professor  or professional tutor. on the other hand  it could also be a parent  sibling  friend  or other relative who has a strong grasp of the english language and is willing to help out.    go to a bookstore and purchase an english grammar workbook  or hop online and access some free grammar resources through the internet.   as a general rule  look for internet sources that come from educational  .edu  websites. examples include   the guide to grammar and writing by capital community college foundation  http   grammar.ccc.commnet.edu grammar   purdue university s online writing lab  https   owl.english.purdue.edu owl section 1 5        above all else  practice makes perfect. the more you can practice english grammar  the better you ll get with it.

query	59	get job satisfaction measure customer satisfaction  measuring customer satisfaction could cover a wide range of different areas  so you should start by thinking carefully about what it is precisely that you want to find out. write down a list of the most important findings you hope to uncover in your research and then organise them in order of importance. this could include   how satisfied the customer is with the quality of the product they purchased. how satisfied the customer is with the in store experience. what the customer thinks about the pricing policies of your business. to what extent the customer felt that his needs were fulfilled.    once you have an idea about the sorts of questions you want to ask  and the kind of information you want to gather  you need to think about what approach to take. you can break down approaches to measuring customer satisfaction into the qualitative and the quantitative.qualitative data would include personal  emotional and subjective responses of individuals. quantitative data could include of statistical records of how often a customer revisits your store  or how often goods are returned. you need different surveying techniques to gather these types of data  so think about whether you want to focus on one approach in particular  or perhaps both.  qualitative and quantitative techniques both have specific strengths and weaknesses  so you need to consider what type of data you are hoping to produce. qualitative information on customer experience and satisfaction gained from interviews or focus groups will help you identify key issues and recurring problems across your customer base.   qualitative research can give you helpful and insightful information about customer perceptions of your business. you can also get a clearer picture of the expectations customers have and in what way you are or are not meeting these expectations.the information will  however  be fairly loosely structured around a few key questions. it can provide you with answers that are open ended and lack specificity.    quantitative research can give you more discreet information and results. it will provide data that is more easily measurable along an objective scale  but will lack the nuance and contextualisation that you get from qualitative research.   a survey that has defined answers  such as  agree    disagree    partially agree  will provide you with quantitative data which you can collate easily. quantitative research is a good way to get a picture of the responses of larger numbers of customers  but the information you gather will be less detailed than qualitative research.  once you have decided what kind of information you are looking for  you need to carefully plan out your customer satisfaction measurement strategy. you will need to think about what questions you are going to ask and what exactly you are trying to measure. you will also need to think about who you are going to ask  and how you are going to ask them.will you conduct interviews over the phone  face to face  or through an online survey  will you ask specific questions with limited answers  or more open ended questions  how will you coordinate your customer satisfaction research     if you are embarking on a comprehensive review of customer satisfaction  it s a good idea to begin by establishing some baseline figures. having a clear picture of where you are starting from will enable you to effectively track your progress and improvements over time. a baseline survey will also pinpoint the key areas you need to focus on.a baseline survey can establish the expectations of your customers. it can also demonstrate how important your customers consider the service to be in their decision to return to your business. you will obtain a clearer view of the relative importance of service  price  convenience  and various other factors.    the main tool in quantitative analysis of customer satisfaction is the survey. you can do in this online  through the post  or on your business premises.surveys enable you to gain a broad range of information  but the depth of the answers will be a limited. have a clear objective in mind when you are preparing a survey.  the broadest questions would concern levels of overall satisfaction  how likely the customer is to buy from you again  and whether or not they would recommend your business to others  other questions can be grouped according to specific parts of your service to focus on individual elements of the customer experience.for example  you might have questions on customer service in store  the quality and price of a product  delivery times  and the ease of completing the transaction.  as well as asking people if they will return to your business  you can monitor customer loyalty more objectively by tracking payments and transactions. metrics from credit card transactions  for example  can be monitored to show who is buying what from your business. this might not be be appropriate for smaller businesses  but larger firms will use this data to develop a clearer view of customer habits and loyalty.  as well as analysing the feedback you have generated through your surveys  don t forget to look out for unsolicited feedback. regularly look online for comments and reviews of your business  and include these in your broader analysis.   if a customer has left a bad review  you could contact them and ask some follow up questions  in order to get a fuller picture of the bad experience they had with your business. websites and social media are an increasingly important and influential forum for customer satisfaction surveys  so you need to engage with this area.  interviews give you a great opportunity to mine the customer s experience and perception of your business. they enable you go further than answers with fixed  discreet answers. the format used can vary greatly  but the one of the advantages it gives you is the possibility to use follow up questions in order to clarify any uncertain remarks.interviews can be conducted over the phone or in person  to a script or more free form. the kind of data you get will depend on the style and format  as well as actual content of the interviews. a skilled interviewer will most likely be able to gain a lot more useful information than someone who is reading from a script. interviews produce the most in depth information  but are the most expensive way to gather data.  focus groups can be a good way to get relatively informal information from a number of your customers. it has the benefits of a face to face interview in that you can gauge the reaction of somebody  and there is ample opportunity for follow up questions. unlike an individual interview  a focus group enables a group dynamic to develop  which can have positive and negative consequences.   you may discover more about perceptions of your business as the members of the group react to each other s remarks. this can highlight disagreements as well as agreements  and expose how different people can respond to the same thing in different ways. aim for small groups of 5 10 people  and record what is said. you might consider hiring a specialist to conduct the focus group  or do it yourself.  feedback cards can be a cheap and low maintenance way to conduct regular research on customer satisfaction. you can leave them out around your business  or hand them out directly to customers. they don t take long to complete and can be analysed quickly.  on the down side  the information you receive will most likely be very limited  and you won t have to opportunity follow up. often feedback cards are treated as an afterthought  with generic questions. they will give customers an opportunity to make a complaint anonymously and quietly  which can highlight problems that would not otherwise have come to light.    mystery shopping is another way to get feedback on the performance of staff  and the service your business is offering to customers. mystery shopping may be done in person in the store  over the phone  or over the internet. a person unknown to you will be hired to act as a normal customer and then document the experience.   mystery shopping can help you see from a customers eye view  and negate the possible biases that managers and supervisors might have about particular teams or employees. the results are  however  somewhat dependant on the professionalism and effectiveness of the mystery shopper.  when you review your findings you need to pinpoint which factors have the largest negative impact on the overall customer experience. identify what problems are most likely to result in them not returning to your business or advising others against going there.once you have identified the most significant factors  these should be the first things you seek to address in your customer satisfaction improvement plan. communicate these results to all of your colleagues to ensure that everyone understands the areas that need to be improved upon.    once you have identified and acted on the most pressing issues that are holding back your business  you need to continue to evaluate and develop your service. test the effectiveness of the changes you have made continuously with feedback and analysis.   you will be able to tailor your research to focus in on the key changes you have made  and evaluate their impact. if you have used quantitative methods to identify problem areas  you will be able to gain a clearer understanding of these problems with some targeted qualitative research.  you may have been able to produce accurate  thorough and helpful information through your own in house evaluations  but you might consider bringing in a customer satisfaction company to help. if you want to broaden or deepen your research  you may require those with particular skills to conduct more thorough focus groups  or help you analyse large data sets.   if you want to develop an ongoing strategy of customer satisfaction measuring  it can be economic and efficient to employ an outside firm to do this work. for example  you are unlikely to have a call centre in house. there are a large number of firms that specialise in this work. consider what s appropriate for your business  and if you do go for an outside specialist  be sure to employ somebody with knowledge and experience of your sector.

might need to pursue litigation. consult a qualified lawyer if you intend to take legal action.  your insurance policy could cover the costs of all or some of the damage. after getting your claim check  move forward with the process of having your car repaired. if your car is declared unrepairable   totalled    you will receive the blue book price  a standard price assigned to used cars  adjusted for certain specifics like the mileage and condition of your car.with your check in hand  you don t need to go to the auto repair shop that performed your original estimate. if the auto

query	70	watch history of television quit watching tv  try not watching tv for just one day a week. make sure to replace that time with another activity that s equally or more satisfying. in other words  don t replace tv time with a task you dread. the task might be noble  such as cleaning the fireplace  or raking leaves  or giving the cat a bath  but such endeavors are best left to when you ve already phased tv out of your life. right now  the best way to wean yourself off of tv is to replace it with another enjoyable activity  but one that s more constructive or engaging  like reading a book  practicing to be a guitar god  or playing drown the penny with your kids. eventually  increase the number of days per week when you don t watch tv  until there are none  if you wish to go that far .    when one of your favorite shows goes off the air or you stop enjoying it  don t replace it with another show. instead  use that new free time to do something else  like calling on friends  doing a hobby  reading  or exercise. eventually  you will whittle down the shows you watch to a manageable few.    many tvs come with a timer feature. when you start watching tv  decide how much time you want to spend there  and set the timer so that the tv turns off when that time is up. this prevents you from  lingering  on the tv  or at least it s a reminder  forcing you to turn the tv back on if you want to keep watching. if you have an older television that does not have a timer  or if you do not know how to use your tv timer  get a simple egg timer from the store. they are cheap  easy to use  and handy for other uses in the house.    bringing attention to your habit  without pressuring yourself to get rid of it  can help you realize how much time you actually waste on tv. in fact  the very act of recording how much time you spend watching tv  and what you watch  is likely to reduce your habit. as you write down  12 30am   watching rerun of friends that i ve seen twice already  you might realize how much of a waste of time it is  and shut off the television  whereas normally you would just keep watching because you lose track of time.    this is a good motivation exercise. once you ve kept a tv diary for at least a week  you ll know how much time television really takes up in your life. now it s time to ask yourself how you can use that time more productively. if you re spending 20 hours a week glued to the tube  think about how much you could accomplish if you redirected that time towards something else  make a list of goals  or things you always complain about but never have time to do. things like   losing weight and getting fit. spending more quality time with friends  your significant other  or your family.       learning or practicing a musical instrument.       planting a garden so you can grow your own food.          the rise in television is linked to the increase in tvs per household.cut down on the number of tvs  and you ll cut down on tv time. you might be met with a good deal of resistance if you live with other people who are addicted to tv  especially kids  see how to get your children away from tv  but do you really need more than one tv  do you really need one at all  if you do leave a tv in the house  at least put it in an uncomfortable place  like the garage  with no comfy couch to lounge in.    another reason people are watching more tv is because there are more channels.look into downgrading your cable or satellite package  and you ll save some money  too  . another option  if your provider offers it  is to program your tv so it only shows channels that don t suck you in  or if they do suck you in  they at least feed your brain. stick to news  science  and history channels. steer clear of entertainment  comedy  and sports channels. make it so that you can t access the  bad  channels unless you have a password  and have someone you trust be the only person who knows the password. having to ask for permission is a good way to filter your tv watching.    even though recording devices like dvr and tivo are associated with an increase in tv watchingyou can also use them for the opposite effect. make a rule that you will only watch recorded shows. then place a limit on how much tv you can record. this will force you to be more selective about what you watch.    this is a critical step because if you do not find something that will keep your interest  you will fall back on your ol  faithful crutch  the tv. look up a volunteer program   check out  that book  books of cd or magazine out of the library  find a new hobby  pick a craft  introduce your self to your family or even your neighbors  or any thing else that you want to do that you are currently not doing. you may want to schedule something during your usual tv watching time  you cannot watch tv at your house and volunteer at the local soup kitchen at the same time.    start with a small amount of time   30 minutes  1 hour  and then expand each day or week.   nan  then increase the time. soon enough your tv time will be replaced with something productive. you may even get to the point where watching tv is a waste of your time and your money. also  you can cut you expenses down by down grading your cable or satellite package.    make sure there are no penalties for doing this. nan nan nan

in order.   make partial or full payments of any remaining standout debts. even putting some money toward the payment of a debt will make you look better in the eyes of creditors. collection agencies will be happy to work with you  and will appreciate your efforts.    before anything else  it s worth making the mental adjustment of understanding what you are really earning and can really afford to spend. your credit score is meant to reflect how you spend your money  so begin by making sure you are well organized and realistic in your financial choices.    having debt is a burden on you psychologically as well as having a negative impact on your options financially. it s time to get it in control    while you don t want to empty retirement accounts  it is a good idea to lower the amount you owe rather than putting more toward your savings at least until you have your credit score in good shape. keep a close handle on your spending. getting into debt usually happens when you spend more than you can afford  so it is important to properly understand your income and make smart choices about what you buy. to achieve these goals  it may be helpful to create a budget. this will help you to save money in other areas of your life so that you can pay down your debt as quickly as possible.    maybe you have several credit cards and debt on each card. not all debt is equal in this case  as cards with high debt to limit ratios are penalized more on your fico credit score than cards with lower debt to limit ratios.   what is a debt to limit ratio  also called credit utilization  it s a measurement of how much debt you have on your card versus how much you are allowed to spend.a credit card with  900 of debt and a credit limit of  1 000 has a very high debt to limit ratio  one of 90 . ideal credit utilization rates are under 10 . if you can get your total debt to under 10  of your available credit  you ve done very well. this should be your target debt level  even if it might take you a while to get there. in general  keeping your utilization under 30  is healthy. transfer debt from one card to the next. if you have one card with a high limit and another card with a high debt load  consider transferring some of the debt over from one card to the other. this might help massage the credit utilization. keep an eye on whether you would be accepting higher interest rates  and make sure to look at your options carefully.    if your credit score is less than stellar  this is going to be more difficult  but applying for a limit increase will lower your total credit utilization and improve your credit score.gather any supporting documents that might demonstrate why you should be given a credit increase  a pay increase  for example  and make your case to someone over the phone. be careful  however  as a limit increase request may cause your credit score to go down by a few points. if the credit card company needs to make a credit score check in order to authorize a limit increase  call the request off     about 35  of your credit score is determined by your payment history  whether you paid your bills on time. if you have any bills that you haven t yet paid  find a way to pay them off.   your credit score gets dinged each time you have a late payment  and then dinged again each time your payment is 30 days late and each time your payment is 90 days late.    you should use your credit card or cards for small purchases and pay off the balance at the end of the month. this shows that you can borrow small amounts of money  what the card provides for convenience when you re at the grocery store  and be relied on to pay it back when you pay your bills at the end of the month.   start using old credit cards again. if you have a credit card that you don t use anymore  the credit issuer may simply decide so stop reporting the account to the credit bureaus. that doesn t sound horrible  until you realize that accounts with a longer history actually improve your overall credit score.so get out your old card  put a small recurring monthly payment on it  or use it every so often to go to the movies. pay off your debt in full each month.    prepaid credit cards don t get reported to credit bureaus. you may be thinking that paying for a credit card up front will give you an easy way to boost your credit score. think again. prepaid credit cards do not get reported to the three major credit bureaus and will not help boost your fico credit score.however  a secured credit card may help you improve your score. this is a credit card with collateral  that becomes the credit limit  and it can be used to improve your credit score  so long as you use it responsibly.a credit card is an agreement  you are allowed to use a certain amount of money  as long as you promise to return it. a prepaid card is just like a transfer of your money into a different account. it won t show future creditors how you handle the contract of promising to pay back what borrow. the difference here could be considered technical  as the collateral you put forth for a secured credit card will cover your credit limit. however  it will be in a separate account  and rather than being spent as you use the card  it will be a final resort for the bank if you fail to pay back what you owe. not all banks offer secured cards  but many do. see if your bank or credit union offers a card that will help you improve your standing.    if you know you ll be able to pay it off  a small personal loan can increase your credit score. about 10  of your fico credit score is what s called  account mix   or basically how many different loans and credit accounts you have. if you take out a small loan and are able to pay it back quickly and responsibly  this will help your credit score.   only take out a loan that you know  with certainty  you ll be able to pay back. if it takes several months or years for you to manage the loan  don t bother. interest rates could eat up any remaining cash  making it harder for you to finish paying off the loan  and increasing your debt. this is simply to increase your credit  not to add more money to your accounts. join a credit union and apply for a loan there instead of at a bank. a credit union is owned by the members and will often be more understanding about lending small amounts of money to working families. see if you can get a small loan through an online peer to peer network to establish your credit. since the decision of these loans will be made by your peers  there is a higher chance of being approved.    a low credit score doesn t mean all your financial opportunities are lost. especially when seeking a loan  make sure you consider potential areas of assistance.   if you own a home but have fallen into debt  check if the value of the property has gone up recently. you may be able to borrow against the equity of your home in order to get the small responsible loan that will increase your credit score. ask a family member for help. someone you know who has better credit than you can assist you in this situation. have them co sign a loan with you. this will guarantee to the bank that it will be repaid  and allow you the chance to show reliability. of course  you need to prove to your friend or family member that you are as good as your word to get them to sign   
query	73	relieve asthma treat asthma attacks  people with chronic asthma may wheeze occasionally and require the use of their asthma medication to control symptoms. an attack is different in that it results in more severe symptoms which last longer and require immediate attention. early symptoms that an attack may be imminent include  itchy neck feeling irritable or short tempered feeling nervous or edgy fatigue dark circles under the eyes    an asthma attack can deteriorate into a life threatening situation that requires immediate medical attention. know how to identify an asthma attack so that you can begin treatment as soon as possible. although signs and symptoms of an asthma attack vary depending on the person  the most common symptoms include wheezing or whistling while breathing. most often the wheezing is heard when a person is breathing out  exhaling  but can sometimes also be heard when they are breathing in  inhaling .coughing. some sufferers may cough in an attempt to clear the airway and get more oxygen into their lungs. this may be especially aggravated at night.shortness of breath. people suffering from asthma attacks will complain of being short of breath. they may be breathing in short shallow breaths that appear to be faster than normal.chest tightness. attacks are often accompanied by a feeling that chest feels tight or that there is pain on the left or right side.low peak expiratory flow  pef  readings. if the person uses a peak flow meter  a small device that measures the maximum speed of expiration in order to monitor a person s ability to exhale air  and the measurements range from 50  to 79  of your personal best  this is indicative of an asthma flare up.    children will often have the same symptoms as adults with asthma  such as wheezing or whistling when breathing  shortness of breath  and chest tightness or pain.   fast breathing is common in an asthma attack in children. children may show  retractions  where you can see their neck pulling  belly breathing  or their ribs when they breathe. in some children a chronic cough can be the only symptom of an asthma attack.in other cases  symptoms of asthma in children are limited to coughing that is made worse with viral infections or when they are sleeping.  assess what is happening to determine if emergency medical attention is needed and what treatment should be done at the scene. individuals who are having mild symptoms may be able to use their medication which should work immediately. those individuals in greater distress should be seen by emergency medical personnel. in the case of a severe asthma attack  call or have someone nearby call emergency medical services before proceeding to treat the attack. know how to distinguish which situation you have on your hands people with asthma who need their medication but may not require immediate medical attention will   be wheezing slightly but not appear in distress may be coughing to clear their airway and get more air have some shortness of breath but able to talk and walk do not appear to be anxious or in distress will be able to tell you they have asthma and where their medication is located   people who are in significant distress and will require immediate medical attention   may appear pale or even have a bluish color to their lips or fingers have the same symptoms as above but intensified and more severe strain their chest muscles to breathe experience severe shortness of breath  which results in short panting breaths wheeze audibly with inspiration or expiration have increased anxiety about the situation possibly be confused or less responsive than normal have trouble walking or talking because of shortness of breath demonstrate persistent symptoms      once you are diagnosed with asthma  create an asthma action plan with your allergist or physician. this plan is basically a step by step process of what to do when you face an acute attack. the plan should be written down and include emergency phone numbers as well as those of family and friends who can meet you at the hospital if needed.when you get the diagnosis  consult with your doctor to identify your particular symptoms of worsening asthma and what you should do when they flare up  e.g. take medication  go to the emergency room  etc .make sure you know how to use your rescue inhalers. write this plan down and keep it with you at all times.    in general  note that prevention of symptoms is the best way to manage and treat asthma. if you know what situations trigger your asthma attacks  such as being around furry animals or extremely hot or cold weather   then try to avoid these when possible.  there are two different type of rescue medications that you may have been prescribed your doctor  a metered dose inhaler  mdi  or a dry powder inhaler  dpi .   mdis the are most common inhalers. they deliver asthma medication through a small aerosol canister equipped with a chemical propellant that pushes the medication into the lungs. an mdi can be used alone or with a breathing chamber   spacer   that separates your mouth from the inhaler  and which can allow you to breathe normally to receive the medication and help the medication get into the lungs more efficiently. a dpi inhaler means of delivering dry powder asthma rescue medication without propellant. brand names of dpi medications include flovent  serevent  or advair. a dpi requires you to breathe in quickly and deeply  which makes them difficult to use during an asthma attack. this makes them less popular than the standard mdis.whichever you have been prescribed  make sure you are always carrying it with you.    note that when suffering an asthma attack  you only want to use an mdi filled with the rescue medication  bronchodilators  such as albuterol    and not corticosteroids or long acting beta 2 agonist bronchodilators. shake the inhaler for five seconds to mix the medication in the canister. before using the inhaler  push out as much air in the lungs as you can. lift your chin and seal your lips around the air chamber or the end of the inhaler. using an air chamber  you would breathe normally and slowly to get the medication. using the inhaler  start to breathe in and press the inhaler once. keep breathing in until you can t get in any more air. hold your breath for 10 seconds and repeat at least one time  but often more  allowing at least one minute between uses. always follow the instructions on your asthma plan.    dpis vary consistently from manufacturer to manufacturer  so care should be taken in reading the instructions before using.   breathe out as much air as possible. seal your lips around the dpi and breathe in strongly until your lungs are full. hold your breath for 10 seconds. remove the dpi from your mouth and exhale slowly. if more than one dose is prescribed  repeat after one minute has passed.    if your asthma symptoms worsen even after taking your medication  you may need to get emergency medical assistance. if you can call emergency services  you should do so. however  if your breathing is too labored and you cannot speak clearly  you may need someone to call for you  such as a friend or family member nearby or a passersby.a good action plan will include the local number for emergency services. in addition  your doctor will have helped you identify when your symptoms are becoming more severe and when you are entering an emergency situation so that you ll know when to get help. call your local emergency number if your attack is not significantly relieved by your rescue inhaler in several minutes.    sit and rest while emergency personnel are coming to your aid. some asthmatics find sitting in the  tripod  position leaning forward with their hands on their knees to be helpful because it can relieve pressure on the diaphragm.   try to stay calm. becoming anxious can increase your symptoms. ask someone in the vicinity to sit with you to help you stay calm until emergency help arrives.    most people with asthma will be more comfortable sitting and not standing or lying down. keep the person upright to assist with lung expansion and ease of breathing. let the person lean slightly forward onto you or a chair for support. some asthmatics may sit in a  tripod  position by leaning forward with their hands on their knees to relieve pressure on their diaphragm.   asthma is exacerbated by anxiety but it is not triggered by anxiety. this means that during an attack the individual will respond more rapidly when he is calm. anxiety releases cortisol in the body which constricts the bronchioles  the passages by which air passes through the nose and or mouth to the air sacs of the lungs.it s important that you stay calm and reassuring as this can assist the person in maintaining calm.    even if the person cannot verbally answer due to wheezing or coughing  he may nod or gesture towards his inhaler or an instruction card.   ask the person if he has a written asthma emergency action plan. many individuals who are prepared for asthma attacks will carry a written emergency plan with them. if the person has one  take it out and help him follow the plan.  asthma is often exacerbated by specific triggers or allergens. ask the individual if something in the immediate area might be triggering an attack and if the person communicates a response  try to remove the trigger or remove the person from the trigger if it is environmental  like pollen or weather related .animals smoke pollen high humidity or cold weather    do this to keep the person calm and reassure him that you are working with him  not against him.   women may keep their inhaler in their handbags and men in a pocket. some asthmatics  especially children or the elderly  may have a clear plastic tube called a spacer that attaches to the inhaler. a spacer delivers the medicine into the mouth with less force  making it easier to inhale. children and elderly people who suffer frequent asthma attacks may also carry nebulizers  which deliver asthma medication through a mouthpiece or mask. they are easy to use  because the patient breathes normally and are thus ideal for the young and old  but are somewhat bulkier than the mdis and require electricity to work. if the person does not have an inhaler  call emergency medical services  especially if the asthmatic is young or elderly. people suffering from asthma attacks without inhalers are serious risk of asphyxiating.    if the person has his head resting downward  temporarily lift his upper body back.   if there is a spacer for the mdi  attach it to the inhaler after shaking. remove the cap from the mouthpiece. help the person tilt his head back if necessary. have the asthmatic exhale as much as possible before using the inhaler. allow the person to administer his own medication. inhaler dosages must be appropriately timed  so allow the asthmatic control of this process. help the person support the inhaler or spacer against his lips if necessary. most asthmatics will pause for a minute or two between puffs.    monitor the asthmatic until paramedics arrive.   even if the asthmatic seems to get better after using their inhaler  it is best if a paramedic or healthcare professional can assess the person. if the person does not want to go to the hospital  he can make that decision after being informed of his health status. continue to help the person with their inhaler if necessary  even if the asthma attack does not decrease in severity the medication will help keep it from worsening by relaxing the airways.    if you or another person do not have an inhaler  it is important to call your local emergency phone number. there are also other steps you can take while awaiting emergency services. however  you should always ask emergency services what they advise while you re on the phone with them.    if at home  running a hot shower or bath can transform the bathroom into a good recovery zone due to the steam.  many people get anxious and panic when they suffer an asthma attack and this can increase breathing. however  panicking usually aggravates the asthma attack because it restricts the amount of oxygen that the lungs get. try to do slow  conscious breathing. breathe in through your nose for a count of four and then out for a count of six.try pursing your lips as you exhale. this can help slow your exhales and keep the airways open for a longer time.    caffeine s chemical structure is similar to common asthma medications  and a small amount of coffee or soda can help relax the airways and reduce respiratory problems.the drug in question here is called theophylline  which can help prevent and treat wheezing  shortness of breath and chest tightness.there may not be enough theophylline present in coffee or tea to counteract the asthma attack  but it is one alternative option.    certain drugs may help relieve the effects of an asthma attack in the case of emergency  although they should never be taken in lieu of getting emergency assistance.   administer a fast acting antihistamine  allergy medicine  if you or the asthmatic thinks an allergen has triggered the reaction. this may be the case if you are outside on a day with a high pollen index. antihistamines include  allegra  benadryl  dimetane  claritin  alavert  tavist  chlor trimeton  and zyrtec  to name a few. echinacea  ginger  chamomile  and saffron are all natural antihistamines. if you can find any teas that contain these ingredients  this might help relieve some symptoms  although the effect of antihistamines in general is likely to be minimal. be careful when using natural herbs or supplements as some people are allergic to the ingredients. use a over the counter pseudoephedrine like .sudafed. sudafed is a nasal decongestant  but it could help during an asthma attack when an inhaler is not present because it can help open the bronchioles. it s best to break the pill down with a mortar and pestle and dissolve in warm water or tea before administering to limit the risk of choking. note as well that while it does work  it can take up to 15 to 30 minutes to be effective. keep in mind as well that pseudoephedrine can increase the heart rate and blood pressure.

in the wrist. the wrist anatomy of people can make a difference   some have naturally smaller passageways in their wrists or have carpal bones that are positioned oddly.    stretching your wrists on a regular basis can be effective at reducing or minimizing carpal tunnel symptoms.in particular  wrist extensions can help make more room for the median nerve in the carpal tunnel by stretching the ligaments that attach to the carpal bones. the easiest way to extend and stretch both wrists at the same time is the  prayer pose  with your palms together. put your palms together in front of your chest and raise your elbows until you feel a nice stretch in your wrists. hold for 30 seconds and repeat 3 5x daily.   you can also grab the fingers of the affected hand and pull backwards until you feel a stretch at the front of your wrist. you may feel more temporary tingling in your hand with this stretch  but don t stop unless you feel pain. in addition to hand tingling  other symptoms commonly associated with carpal tunnel syndrome are  numbness  throbbing pain  muscle weakness and color changes  too pale or too red . the only part of the wrist   hand typically spared symptoms is the little finger   it s not innervated by the median nerve.    the symptoms of carpal tunnel are often related to having inflammation   swelling in the wrist  which either directly irritates the median nerve or crowds  pinches  it. as such  taking otc non steroidal anti inflammatories  nsaids   such as ibuprofen  motrin  advil  or naproxen  aleve   can be very helpful to reduce symptoms short term.painkillers such as acetaminophen  tylenol  paracetamol  can be used for carpal tunnel also  but they don t impact swelling  only the pain.   anti inflammatories and analgesics should be considered short term strategies for pain control. there isn t any evidence that these drugs improve carpal tunnel syndrome in the long term.taking too many nsaids or taking them for too long significantly increases your risk of stomach irritation  ulcers and kidney failure. taking too much acetaminophen or taking it for too can cause liver damage. as an alternative  rub an ointment that contains a natural pain reliever into your sore wrist   hand. menthol  camphor  arnica and capsaicin are all helpful for relieving mild to moderate pain.    if your wrist is sore and looks or feels swollen  then apply a small bag of crushed ice  or something cold  to it in order to reduce inflammation and numb the pain. doing so may also reduce hand symptoms. cold therapy is most effective for soft tissue injuries that involve some sort of swelling because it reduces blood flow.apply the crushed ice to your wrist for about 5 10 minutes 3 5x daily until the symptoms subside.   compressing the ice against your wrist with a stretchy tensor or ace bandage is even more effective for fighting inflammation. always wrap ice in a thin cloth before applying it skin   it prevents skin irritation or frostbite. if crushed ice isn t available  use a large ice cube  frozen gel pack or small bag of frozen veggies instead. in some cases  cold therapy may aggravate the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. avoid ice if that s the case with you.    wearing a rigid brace or splint that holds your wrist in a neutral position during the day may reduce the compression or irritation of the median nerve and help with carpal tunnel symptoms.splints or wrist braces can also be worn during activities that aggravate symptoms  such as working at the computer  bowling or carrying groceries. wearing splints while you sleep can help relieve nighttime symptoms of tingling and numbness in your hands  especially if you have a habit of curling your wrists.you may need to wear a splint for several weeks  day and night  to get significant relief from carpal tunnel symptoms. for some sufferers  splints and braces provide negligible benefit. splinting at night can be a good idea if you re pregnant and have carpal tunnel syndrome because pregnancy tends to increase swelling  edema  in the hands and feet. wrist splints and braces can be purchased at most pharmacies and medical supply stores.    some sleeping postures can aggravate the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.sleeping with your fists clenched and wrists tucked in  flexed  is the worst position  but having your arms extended above your head is not great either. instead  sleep on your back or side with your arms at your sides  and try to keep your hands open and your wrists in a neutral position. wearing a wrist splint or brace is very helpful in this regard  although it takes a little getting used to.   don t sleep on your stomach with your hands   wrists compressed under your pillow. people who do this frequently wake up with numb and tingly hands. most wrist splints and braces are made of nylon and fasten with velcro  which can irritate other parts of your body. consider covering your splint with a sock or thin cloth to reduce irritating other body parts.    your carpal tunnel problem may be caused or aggravated by a poorly designed work station. if your computer keyboard  mouse  desk and or chair isn t positioned properly for your height and body proportions  it can put strain on your wrists  shoulders  neck and mid back. make sure your keyboard is low enough so that your wrists are not constantly bent upwards while typing.consider getting an ergonomic keyboard and mouse  designed to take the stress off your wrists and hands.   putting cushioned pads underneath your keyboard and mouse can lessen the impact on your hands and wrists. have an occupational therapist review your body positions while performing your job. people who work on computers for many hours each day are at higher risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.  if you are feeling any carpal tunnel symptoms in your wrist and hand that persist for more than a few weeks  then see your doctor for an examination. your doctor may take x rays and blood tests to rule out other causes of wrist   hand pain  such as rheumatoid arthritis  osteoarthritis  advanced diabetes  hairline fractures or vascular problems.   electrodiagnostic studies  emg and nerve conduction  are usually done to confirm the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome.your doctor will see if you can perform certain tasks that are difficult with carpal tunnel syndrome  such as  making a tight fist  pinching your thumb and forefinger together and manipulating small objects with precision.your doctor may ask about your profession  as certain jobs are at high risk  carpenters  cashiers  assembly line workers  musicians  auto mechanics and people who work on computers for long hours.    your doctor may recommend injecting the carpal tunnel area of your wrist with corticosteroid medication  such as cortisone  to relieve the pain  inflammation and other symptoms.corticosteroids are strong and fast acting anti inflammatories that can quickly decrease swelling in your wrist  which relieves pressure on the median nerve. taking oral corticosteroids  by mouth  is another option  but these drugs are not considered as effective as injections and they come with significant side effects.   other common corticosteroid medications used for carpal tunnel syndrome are prednisolone  dexamethasone and triamcinolone. potential complications of corticosteroid injections include local infection  bleeding  tendon weakening  local muscle atrophy and nerve irritation   damage. as such  injections are limited to 2 per year. if corticosteroid injections fail to significantly reduce the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome  then surgery should be considered.    if all other remedies and treatments fail to give you relief  then your doctor will likely recommend carpal tunnel surgery. surgery should be considered as a last resort  although it can completely relieve your symptoms for good with minimal risk  so it should not be considered as a long shot. the goal of surgery is to relieve pressure on the median nerve by cutting the ligament pressing on it.however  carpal tunnel surgery can be performed in two different ways  endoscopic or open surgery.   endoscopic surgery involves uses a telescope like device with a tiny camera on the end  endoscope   which is inserted through a small incision in your wrist or hand. the endoscope can see inside the carpal tunnel and cut the problematic ligament. endoscopic surgery typically results in the least amount of pain and the quickest recovery. open surgery involves making a larger incision in the palm of your hand and over your wrist in order to cut through the problematic ligament  which frees the nerve. surgery risks include  nerve damage  infection and scar tissue formation.    following the surgery  it s done on an outpatient basis   you ll be asked to often elevate your hand above your heart and move your fingers  which reduces swelling and prevents stiffness.mild pain  swelling and stiffness in the palm and wrist can be expected post surgery for up to 6 months  and complete recovery may take a year. for the first 2 4 weeks  you may be required to wear a splint or brace  although using your hand is encouraged.   most people s symptoms get much better after surgery  but recovery is often slow and gradual. on average  hand strength returns to normal 2 months after surgery.carpal tunnel syndrome can occasionally recur  about 10  of the time  and may require additional surgery.  
query	77	identify dna identify an exotic shorthair cat  the fur on an exotic shorthair cat is thick and dense like its relative the persian. however  unlike the persian  the fur is plush and short. it almost gives the cat the general appearance of having the coat of a teddy bear.this coat makes the exotic shorthair much more easy to keep groomed than a persian. unlike a persian  which should be groomed daily  an exotic shorthair rarely needs to be brushed. this is why the exotic shorthair is nicknamed the  the lazy man s persian. the only area on the cat that may have longer fur is the tail  but this is not always the case.    the exotic shorthair comes in a wide variety of fur colors. its coloring can be anything from white all the way to black and every color in between  including variations of brown  orange  and grey. this makes it very difficult for non professionals to use coat coloring as a way to identify the breed.  this is not to say that there isn t a standard for the coloring of an exotic shorthair. it just means that the standard is extremely varied and complicated.    an exotic shorthair s eyes are very distinctive. they should only be green or blue green  or brilliant copper in color. they are also very round  which complements the roundness of the cat s body and face shape.  like its relative  the persian  the exotic shorthair has a delightfully flat face that is warm and inviting. its eyes are set far apart and its face is very round and large in proportion to its body. it has an extremely stubby nose that is set in line with its eyes  which is key to its distinctive look.the cat s nose is almost flush against the head  as the cat s muzzle is very short.    an exotic shorthair has small ears for the size of its head but this smallness highlights the cat s round and soft head. the short little ears are spread far apart and  although sticking up  are low to the head.the ears are rounded at the tips and tilted slightly forward  which also increases the rounded appearance of the cat s head.    the exotic shorthair cat usually looks big boned yet well proportioned. the general look of its body proportion has been described as  rounded.  this strength of build may also be described as  sturdy  yet not large or obese.the cat s legs are slightly short for the size of its body. this also adds to the perceived roundness of the cat. part of the reason the cat has this appearance is the plushness of its coat. the fullness of the fur adds to the roundness of the cat s appearance.    exotic shorthair cats are known to be easy going and relaxed. they love to lounge around and curl up in their owners laps. they also don t get disturbed by much  so are not apt to run away and hide if a new person comes in your house or a loud noise is made.  the relaxed nature of the exotic shorthair means that they like interacting with their humans but they do not need attention all of the time. for example  depending on the specific cat  they might sleep with you or take a nap on your lap  or they might prefer to spend their sleeping time alone.some people assert that male exotic shorthair cats are more cuddly and affectionate than female exotic shorthair cats.this may  however  depend completely on your specific cat.    unlike a persian  which is known to be very docile  an exotic shorthair can have more liveliness. they like to play and run around more than a persian and they tend to stay active into adulthood.your adult exotic shorthair is likely to enjoy the simple pleasures of a cat s life  such as playing with a dripping faucet or climbing in and out of a cardboard box.    exotic shorthair cats are very quiet cats. their voices are seldom heard and they do not meow incessantly when begging like other breeds can. while there are always exceptions  if your cat is very  very quiet  it may be an exotic shorthair.instead of meowing for food or attention  an exotic shorthair is likely to sit right in front of you and make intense eye contact with you until you give it what it wants.    if you are unsure about your cat s breed  discuss it with your veterinarian. they are likely to be well versed in popular cat breeds and are likely to see a wide variety in their work.  discussing your cat s breed with your veterinarian can also allow you to get information about potential health problems that are common with your particular breed of cat. once your veterinarian identifies what breed your cat is  ask them about any issues that might be common in this type of cat.    if you cannot identify the physical characteristics or behavior yourself  consult with an expert. this could be a cat behaviorist or trainer  or someone that is familiar with the breed standards of the exotic shorthair  such as a breeder or member of a cat breed club.  if you want to find a breeder or a cat breed club  consult the website of a national cat organization  such as the cat fanciers  association. they should have lists available of breeders and local clubs available.    if you want definitive verification about what type of cat you have  get a dna test done on it. you will need to contact a company that does cat dna testing and have them send you a sampling kit. once you have collected a sample of your cat s saliva  you will send it back to the company to be analyzed and then the company will send you the results.there are a wide variety of labs that do dna testing on pets. some are private labs and some are labs connected to organizations  such as veterinary schools or animal appreciation organizations. dna testing is done for a fee  so you may want to shop around to see what company will do your cat s dna testing for cheapest. however  you may also want to search for online reviews of companies to verify that they provide quality service.  
query	78	diagnose hepatitis c evaluate your hepatitis c risk  some people may be at higher risk for getting hepatitis c. organizations such as the world health organization and the mayo clinic suggest screening for these individuals. consider testing for hepatitis c if you inject drugs. use intranasal drugs. have received infected blood products at a facility with inadequate infection control practices  usually before the 1980 s . have had invasive medical procedures at facilities with inadequate infection control practices. are the child of a mother with hepatitis c. have hiv. are or were incarcerated.    there is no vaccine for hepatitis c  but taking preventative measures can minimize your risk for contracting the disease. figuring out occasions on which you may have been exposed to hepatitis c can help you better evaluate your risk for the disease.think about and note any occasions on which you may have been exposed to hepatitis c. consider things such as where you were  what you touched  and if you required medical treatment. for example  if you were traveling to a country that doesn t screen blood and required medical care  you may have been exposed to hepatitis c. you may have been a good samaritan and helped a person in an accident. if you came in contact with any of the person s blood  you may have been infected with hepatitis c.another common cause is if you receive a transplant that is coinfected with hepatitis c. transplant recipients who receive organs from hcv positive donors have a high risk of acquiring hcv infection and liver disease.  this can minimize your risk of not getting prompt screening for the disease. symptoms of hepatitis c include fever. fatigue. loss of appetite. nausea. vomiting. abdominal pain. dark urine. clay colored bowel movements. join pain. jaundice. bleeding or bruising easily.itchy skin. swelling in the legs.    however  70 to 80  of individuals infected with hepatitis c don t have any symptoms. if you suspect you ve been exposed to the disease  it s important to undergo tests for a diagnosis.consider getting tested for hepatitis c if you have any doubt. there is no harm in getting screened  even if your risk is fairly low. this could minimize the risk of serious health conditions and prevent you from transmitting the disease to someone else.    one of the best ways to share your concerns about the risk of contracting hepatitis c and evaluating your risk is speaking to your doctor. a medical professional will consider various factors and determine if screening is necessary.let your doctor know about your concerns. inform them about known risk factors and situations in which you may have been exposed to hepatitis c. ask any questions you have about the disease and things that may make you at risk for hepatitis c.    a person can contract hepatitis c by coming in contact with the blood from an individual who has the disease. most people today are infected with hepatitis c by sharing needles or other implements to inject drugs. people infected with hepatitis c can also transmit the disease even if they show no symptoms or are unaware they have it. other ways that hepatitis c spreads include sharing needles or syringes. injection drug use accounts for 60  of cases. needlestick injuries in health care settings. healthcare setting injuries account for less than 5  of cases. mother to a fetus or infant. perinatal exposure accounts for less than 5  of cases. sharing personal items  such as razors  with a person who has the disease  rare . sexual contact with an infected person. sexual contact accounts for approximately 15  of cases. unlicensed and or unhygienic tattooing or piercing conditions  rare . receiving a blood transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products. blood transfusion infection rates account for 10  of patients.  just as it s important to know how hepatitis c is spread  it s also vital to know how you can t get the disease. this can minimize your concern about contracting hepatitis c and may help you avoid potentially uncomfortable situations. you cannot get hepatitis c by sharing eating utensils. breastfeeding. hugging. kissing. holding hands. coughing. sneezing. sharing food or water. being bitten by a mosquito or insect.    any person can contract hepatitis c. there are some general risk factors that may expose you to hepatitis c. you should consider these when evaluating your own risk for the disease. the risk factors include injecting street drugs or past drug injection. receiving donated blood  blood products  or organs. hemodialysis patients or those who received it for a long time. getting a tattoo or piercing in an unsterile environment. being infected with hiv. being the child of a mother with hiv.  
query	79	cause insomnia cope with insomnia  if you haven t already  discuss your insomnia with a doctor to make sure there is no treatable medical reason for your poor sleep. there is a long list of conditions that can cause symptoms that mimic insomnia  from anxiety and depression  to hyperthyroidism  lyme disease  and heart conditions.your insomnia could be caused by obstructive sleep apnea  a common condition in people who snore. this condition occurs when the muscles in the back of your throat are relaxing so much that your airway narrows for 10 20 seconds  preventing you briefly from getting air. your brain will wake you so you can get more air  over and over again throughout the night causing disrupted sleep.go over your medications with your doctor  as some may interfere with your sleep. this includes mentioning anything herbal  alternative  or over the counter that you might be taking.be sure to tell your doctor if you have any pain that is preventing you from sleeping. your doctor may recommend cognitive behavioural therapy  completing sleep journals  or relaxation training to sort out your sleep.    though you may be tempted to take a quick nap during the day  and many people can do so effectively  napping may be counterproductive for the insomnia sufferer.if you must nap  maximize it at 30 minutes and don t nap after 3 pm. stick to as regular a sleep schedule as possible  waking and going to bed at the same time each day  even on weekends.    sleep experts agree that your bed should be used only for sleep and sexual intimacy so keep the computers and tv out of your bedroom.have black out curtains to keep your room dark at night. keep your bedroom cool. being too warm prevents you from falling soundly asleep. studies have shown that wearing a cooling cap at night reduces time to fall asleep and increases length of sleep.use a white noise machine or fan to drown out inconsistent environmental noises and create a comforting atmosphere.    both supplements are touted as facilitating sleep. just be sure to not take them too early before bed  within 30 minutes is best  or for too many weeks without consulting your doctor.you should also consult your doctor if you are currently taking any medications. herbal supplements are all natural  but sometimes they do interact with medications. melatonin occurs naturally in the body to regulate your sleep wake cycle and we generally lose melatonin as we age  hence the creation of a supplement. its safety in long term usage is not known. take 3 5 milligrams 30 minutes before bed.melatonin can interact with anticoagulants  immunosuppressants  diabetes medications  and birth control pills.valerian root is an herbal supplement with a mildly sedating effect. this root can be somewhat addictive. try 200 milligrams 30 minutes before bed.valerian root may increase other sleep aids  effects as well as the sedative effects of alcohol  benzodiazepines and narcotics and can interfere with other prescription medications.  it is important to deal with your stress and get back to a regular sleep schedule. there are several things that you can do to counter nighttime stress  such as journaling about your stresses  developing a bedtime ritual  and practicing progressive muscle relaxation.    acupuncture helps decrease stress by regulating hormones  and decreased stress leads to a better sleep. acupuncture may also assist the release of melatonin.ear acupuncture in particular seems to be helpful for facilitating sleep.    we tend to feel more tired when we are dehydrated because our blood thickens  forcing your heart to pump harder to circulate the blood throughout your body  and this extra work by the heart tires us out.doctors recommend having 2 liters of water a day  or about 8 glasses. soft drinks and coffee don t count. you can also get water naturally through fruits and vegetables such as watermelon  celery  and broccoli. you ll know you re getting dehydrated if your urine turns from a pale  clear fluid  as it is when you re well hydrated  to a darker yellow. don t wait until you feel thirsty to drink. by the time your brain starts sending you signals  you re already lacking fluids  hence the message of being thirsty. drink regularly throughout the day to stay hydrated.    getting little bursts of carbohydrates and protein throughout the day will help you stay awake and alert. plus  if you eat every 3 4 hours  you won t have blood sugar crashes  which make you feel tired.eating breakfast really is the most important way to start the day  so don t skip it. if you find you re often on the run to work or school and don t have time for breakfast  get into the habit of preparing grab and go options. include fibre so you have the slower release of carbs that keeps you from crashing. include popcorn  tortillas  or whole grain pitas in your meal and snack time  for example. small meal examples that work include low fat yogurt with berries and granola  a whole grain chicken wrap with greens  or apple slices with some peanut butter.    it is generally recommended that you avoid caffeine after noon. when you live with chronic insomnia  this might be really hard to do so try to minimize it to 200 300 milligrams  or no more than 2 cups of coffee.decaffeinated coffees are not 100  caffeine free  so don t be fooled. energy drinks may not be a good choice. they have up to 250 milligrams of caffeine per serving and can increase your tolerance to caffeine  meaning you need more and more caffeine to feel the effects. they also have a lot of sugar and don t actually provide any more energy than a regular soda.  although alcohol is often associated with partying and fun  it is actually a depressant that will drag you down and make you even more sleepy  make you restless at night  and increase your night time waking.  getting at least a 30 minute workout a day  five hours before bed  will increase your chances of sleeping better at night.expending energy breeds energy. exercise boosts your energy producing mitochondria in your cells  fuels your circulation of vital oxygen  and releases neurotransmitters and the feel good endorphins responsible for the  runners  high. short bursts of activity throughout the day can help you manage the fatigue that might set in while you are at work or school. take the stairs instead of the elevator. walk to school instead of taking the bus. get up and walk around the office for a minute every 30 minutes.    dance around to music while you unload the dishwasher or put on music in your office  if allowed.    having a quick shower in the middle of the day or even just going to the bathroom to splash some water on your face can do wonders to wake yourself up.  even for a brief spell  taking a quick break to get some sun and fresh air can invigorate you enough to get through the rest of the day.    if you find that your insomnia is affecting your work habits  try cutting out distractions at work so that you can really focus when you have the energy to do so. that includes self distracting behaviours such as checking facebook.work with a clear goal in mind. whether you re trying to write an essay for school or prepare a presentation at work  having a focus and smart goals will then help you feel energized when achieve your goal. have a task list and avoid straying from it. do the more mentally taxing work when you re sharp and keep the menial tasks for when you re more tired. you can still be productive filing or writing emails when you re worn down. work standing up  if possible. it helps keep you awake and burns calories.  
query	80	donate kidney donate your kidney  you can choose to donate a kidney directly to someone you know  but only if you are a compatible match. you also have the option of donating to a stranger or participating in a paired exchange donation  which means you will donate your kidney to a stranger on the condition that a compatible stranger also donates a kidney to your loved one.some kidney transplant centers allow you to be a good samaritan donor  which means you can initiate a chain of donations by donating your kidney to a stranger. when you donate your kidney  the recipient s loved one will donate hers  and so on and so forth. this will probably not directly impact anyone you know personally  but it will help a lot of people. if you don t want to donate your kidney while you are still alive  but you want to help someone after you die  you can register to donate all of your organs or specific organs by signing up on your specific state s registry or indicating your preferences on your driver s license.    once you have decided that you would like to donate a kidney  you must contact a transplant center in order to initiate your application. the transplant center should have a nurse available to answer all of your questions and help you decide if donation is really right for you.if you are donating to a specific person  you must contact the transplant center that has approved them for a transplant. if the person has not yet been approved  you will not be able to proceed with donating your kidney until that happens.if you are not doing a direct donation  you have a choice regarding which facility you work with. contact multiple facilities and ask questions regarding their success rates  their policies for matching donors and recipients  and the financial assistance they offer in order to choose the right one for you. consult the u.s. department of health and human services  organ procurement and transplantation network for a complete list of transplant centers in the united states.  if you want to donate to a specific person  you will need to undergo blood testing to determine if you are a match. the initial screening involves a simple blood test.you must have a compatible blood type in order to donate your kidney to a specific individual. people who have type a blood can accept blood from donors with type a or type o. people with type b blood can receive blood from people with type b or type o. people with type ab blood can receive blood from someone with any blood type. people with type o blood can only receive blood from a donor with type o blood. the antibodies in your blood must also be compatible with those in the recipient s blood. in general  the more antibodies that recipient has  the more difficult it will be to find a match. doctors also consider antigen matching. you do not need to be an exact match in order to donate  but research has found that an exact match does increase the success rate of the transplant. if you have passed all of the other tests  doctors will then perform a cross matching test  which may actually be a series of several tests. doctors will collect cells and serum  blood without the cells in it  from both the donor and the recipient and mix them together to see if the recipient s body is likely to reject the donor s organ. if these tests come back negative  you will be considered a match. keep in mind that if you are not a match for your loved one  you still have the option of participating in a paired exchange donation program  which will greatly increase the chances that your loved one will receive a kidney in a timely fashion.  in order to donate a kidney  you must be healthy enough to undergo surgery and to do well afterward with only one kidney. you also must have a sufficiently low risk of developing kidney problems in the future.your doctor will likely perform blood tests  urine tests  x rays  an ekg  and a ct angiogram to check your overall health and look for any abnormalities of your kidneys.certain chronic conditions  such as diabetes and liver disease  may disqualify you from donating your kidney. if you are a smoker  you will be required to quit at least one month before undergoing surgery to have your kidney removed.you may also be disqualified from donating a kidney if you have certain diseases that could be passed on to the recipient  such as hiv or hepatitis. you will also be required to undergo a psychological examination in order to confirm that you are aware of the risks of donating your kidney and are choosing to do it of your own free will. if you have any health conditions  you might require a pre surgical clearance from your treating doctor in order to be approved for surgery.    donating a kidney requires that you undergo major surgery  and this is not without risks. make sure to talk to your doctor about the risks before you agree to undergo surgery  and always ask if you have an increased risk of complications for any reason. although rare  some risks of surgery include the following bleeding infection blood clots in the lung  pulmonary embolism  death    kidney donors do not usually have shorter lifespans or a diminished quality of life as a result of the surgery.there are  however  some long term risks to keep in mind.   while your body is perfectly capable of functioning normally with only one kidney  you will be at a disadvantage should your remaining kidney fail. if you end up needing a kidney transplant  you will be given preference as a prior donor.kidney donors may have a somewhat higher chance of developing high blood pressure.having only one kidney may prevent you from being eligible for certain military  police  and fire fighting jobs.  most of the time  your medical expenses will be covered by either the recipient s insurance or by the transplant center if you choose to donate a kidney. make sure to find out if you will be responsible for any costs. also  keep in mind that the surgery may have many hidden costs that are not covered. the following expenses are typically not covered  although you may be able to get help with them by contacting a nonprofit agency expenses for travel to and from the transplant center childcare lost wages during your recovery period medical expenses related to long term surgical complications    there are two different surgeries your doctor may perform to remove your kidney  an open incision removal and a laparoscopic procedure. the laparoscopic procedure is much less invasive  which means there are fewer risks involved and the recovery time is shorter.a laparoscopic procedure means that instead of making a large incision and the surgeon using their hands to do the surgery inside your body  a very small set of incisions are made and instruments with long handles are inserted into the holes. the surgeon uses the instruments to do the surgery without ever opening up the abdomen. the laparoscopic procedure may not be an option for all patients  depending on their surgical histories and the anatomy of the individual s kidney and whether it can be accessed and removed with the laparoscopic instruments alone.    your doctor will give you specific instructions that you must follow prior to surgery. most commonly  you will be restricted from eating and drinking in the hours leading up to your surgery  usually beginning the night before. this is to prevent aspiration of food into your lungs when you are under anesthesia. it is very important to follow these and all other instructions  as they are meant to reduce your risk of surgical complications.make sure your doctor knows about all of the medications you are taking. you may be required to stop some medications prior to surgery.    depending on the type of surgery and a host of personal factors  recovery typically takes anywhere between one and six weeks. you should expect to experience pain  discomfort  and fatigue while you recover.it s a good idea to have a caretaker available to help you with daily activities  like preparing meals and you may have to spend a few days recovering in the hospital before you are sent home. people who are in good shape tend to recover from surgery faster than people who are out of shape  so you might want to begin an exercise regimen before your surgery.moving around in the days following your surgery will help you avoid complications  such as blood clots.  your doctor will probably have you come in for at least one post surgical check up. the purpose of this is to make sure you are healing properly  so be sure to go to all scheduled appointments.it is also important to continue getting regular medical checkups throughout your life. your doctor may want to monitor your kidney function to make sure your remaining kidney is functioning properly.    when you are released from the hospital  your doctor will give you a list of activities that you should avoid for certain periods of time. these restrictions are meant to help you heal and to protect you from injury  so it is very important that you follow them.you should not do any heavy lifting in the weeks following your surgery. your doctor will provide you with specific guidelines. depending on the type of work you do  you may not be medically cleared to return to work for several weeks. the more strenuous your

query	82	break pubis recognize crabs  this is the most common symptom of having crabs. it will usually start 5 days after you get exposed to the bug and be isolated within the genital and anal area.it tends to be worse during nighttime hours because this is the time when the lice become more active and feed more often.   fight the urge to itch  as getting lice under your fingernails or on your hands will make the infection more likely to spread. even if you re not entirely sure crabs may be the culprit  it s better to be safe than sorry.    this will appear once the crabs have bitten the surface of your skin. it indicates that blood has been withdrawn from your skin through biting. several spots will be seen depending on how many crabs currently infest the pubis area.   the longer you ve had crabs  the more visible these colored spots will become. if left untreated  the area will be covered in all the dark spots the lice have bit.    crabs do a lot of hair gripping through their claws that will prevent them from falling from the hair. if you look closely you will see eggs attached to the hair and lice crawling over the area.   of course  it s not just your pubic hair that could be affected  though that s the most common site. if necessary  take a close look at your eyebrows and eyelashes  too  for similar manifestations.    nits are the eggs of the crabs. they look like white  tiny  oval shaped eggs. they are usually found near the roots or the base of the hair.   these are just as important to get rid of as the crabs themselves. once you ve started treatment and adult lice aren t visible  nits are what you need to keep an eye on to make sure the infection doesn t return.    crab lice have similar characteristics to crabs   that is  they have stereotypical claws that are normally associated with ordinary aquatic crabs. however  they re not easily seen due to their size and location. but nevertheless  they still can be seen with ease under a magnifying glass. can you see the claws    the average louse is about 1 to 2 millimeters in diameter. they are very tiny and just barely visible to the human eye. your dermatologist might use a magnifying glass to diagnose you. it s a surefire way to know exactly what you re dealing with.    lice that haven t fed on blood yet have this color   but when they have already fed on blood they will turn into a rust colored or dark brown due to presence of blood in their body.   crabs feed roughly every 45 minutes. you may notice a change in color in this interval if you monitor them stringently.    in general  crabs live for about 30 days. if they are away from the body  they can survive for 2. that means that even if you re rid of lice  or the people in your household do not currently have lice   it doesn t mean you re home free.   they love warm areas. if the temperature drops  as in they get removed from the body   they will head for warmer ground. this means you may be able to find them in your sheets or in other dark  stuffy areas.    as soon as you find out you have crabs  make a trip to your local pharmacy or grocery store for an over the counter lice killing lotion or shampoo. if you follow the directions on the label and are diligent  your crabs can easily be gone in no time. it may take a few applications  but it will work.   along with treating your body  treat your home  too. wash your sheets  towels  and linens to prevent any lice that may be surviving out in the open from creating a recurring issue. this goes double if you live with others  as crabs are contagious and do not require physical contact for transference.    crab lice may exist in two forms on your body    live lice form  which can be seen crawling on the infected area  egg form  otherwise known as  nits   finding either form indicates the presence of an infestation which requires immediate treatment. even just one egg can present a problem.    in most cases  there aren t any serious complications seen with crabs  however  in patients with weak immune systems or other chronic diseases complications may be seen. because of this  aesthetics and stigma aside   it s important to start treatment as soon as possible.   in cases of infestation that have not been treated for a long period of time  discoloured skin may be seen at the sites where the lice have been constantly biting and feeding from your blood.    if you already have wounds present near the genital area or you get injured and this is then superimposed with an infestation of crabs  this could lead to a more serious skin infection which could spread around the body through the blood. this type of infection is called a  secondary infection.    pubic lice in the eyelashes or eyebrows gives rise to irritation of the eyes leading to potential cases of conjunctivitis as well as secondary infections of the eye.    special treatment has to be taken for treating crab lice in the eyebrows and eyelashes. your ophthalmologist will prescribe you with ophthalmic grade petroleum jelly which must be used on the eyelid margins at least two to five times per day for a period of 7 10 days. this is usually enough to kill the lice effectively.   additionally  with care  tweezers may be used to remove any visible lice that may be present within the eyelashes and eyebrows. regular petroleum jelly  such as vaseline  must not be used in the eyes as it is an irritant.  
query	83	evaluate respiratory system clear respiratory foreign bodies from a cat  foreign bodies can get lodged in the nose  throat  trachea  or bronchi of a cat  and the symptoms vary depending on the exact location of the foreign object. look for any of the following symptoms nasal discharge sneezing nose pawing or nose bleeds head shaking gagging salivation difficulty swallowing or breathing bad breath pawing at the face and mouth coughing retching blue coloured gums fainting anorexia    in most instances a foreign body  such as a blade of grass or a piece of a stick  will enter your cat while they are smelling or chewing these objects. keep a close eye on your cat while it is playing outside. this way you will have a better indication of what might be the problem if your cat starts to develop symptoms.  if you notice any common symptoms associated with a respiratory foreign body  or you believe your cat may have ingested a foreign object  you should take your cat to the vet immediately. if left untreated  a foreign body in the respiratory system could cause an infection or lead to chronic lung disease. in some cases the foreign object may travel through the body  causing severe complications and even death.your vet will need to run a number of tests in order to rule out other possible illnesses and to find the exact location of the foreign object.    your vet will likely need to administer a number of examinations in order to determine the exact location of the foreign object. an examination can also provide your vet with more detailed information concerning the type of object that has been lodged in the respiratory system. your vet may administer any of the following tests a complete blood count  cbc   biochemical profile  and urinalysis. an x ray of the throat and chest. skull nasal radiographs. a scope may be used to evaluate the nasal cavity  trachea  and bronchi. a ct scan or mri may be useful in some cases.    this is often done by administering a local anesthetic and then reaching in and grabbing the object from the throat or nasal cavity. this type of removal is only possible if the object is visible and easily accessible.in some cases  you may be able to do this without the help of a vet  if you are able to see the object and are certain you can remove it completely and without causing any damage to the nasal passage. it is safest to let the vet do any removal  however.    your vet may be able to encourage the foreign object to dislodge itself  by flushing the respiratory tract. a lubricant will be flushed through the respiratory tract in the hope of dislodging and washing out the foreign object.  to remove a foreign body using a scope  the vet will place a tube into the cat s nasal cavity or throat and pull out the object. typically the object will be removed using forceps or a balloon catheter.if the lodged object is sharp  a protective tube can be placed down the cat s throat to protect the esophagus while the object is retrieved.    in severe cases  the foreign object may be lodged deep within your cat s internal respiratory system. in these instances  the vet may need to complete a surgery to remove the object. your vet may use a local anesthetic or full anesthesia  depending on the location and invasiveness of the procedure.this type of surgery is relatively common and safe  and has a 93  recovery rate.  although cats generally recover quickly from removal procedures  it is still a good idea to schedule a follow up appointment with your vet. during this appointment your vet will check to make sure that your cat is not suffering from any lingering pain or infection as a result of the lodged object or removal procedure.  your vet may notice that the foreign body has caused a secondary infection. this happens if the foreign body contained bacteria that was spread to the cat. if this is the case  your vet will prescribe antibiotics to help treat the secondary infection.follow all instructions provided by your vet for administering the antibiotic.    if your vet suspects that your cat is still experiencing residual pain as a result of the foreign object removal  they may prescribe pain medication during the follow up appointment. it is very important that you follow of the instructions provided by the vet when administering medication.for example  your vet may prescribe a corticosteroid  such as methylprednisolone.  giving your cat wet food can also alleviate pain following this procedure. this type of food is typically softer and will be less irritating if your cat experienced a foreign body lodged in the throat. talk with your vet to see if this is a suitable option for your cat.

query	86	care skin choose a skin care line  knowing your skin type is essential to finding the right products to care for it. the basic types are normal  oily  dry  and combination. your type is determined by the size of your pores  the degree of oil and moisture in your skin  and its sensitivity to environmental irritants.you have normal skin if you have few imperfections  no significant sensitivities  and small pores that are barely visible. oily skin generally comes from large pores. it leads to dull or shiny skin that is prone to blackheads  acne  and other blemishes that arise from clogged pores. you have dry skin if your skin is rough  scaly  or dull. it also may be spotted with red or itchy patches. your pores will be so small as to be practically invisible. combination skin that combines areas of oily  normal  and or dry skin is common. for instance  many people have larger pores that produce more oil on their foreheads  noses  and chins.    besides knowing your skin type  you should also note if you have any significant sensitivities to environmental irritants. if your skin sometimes itches  stings  burns  and or breaks out in a rash when you use beauty or hygienic products  then you have sensitive skin.if you do  you should go for beauty products that are for sensitive skin  hypoallergenic  and free from dyes and fragrances.    besides catering to a particular skin type  many skin care lines are aimed at improving specific  treatable conditions that affect your skin. ask yourself what problems you are trying to correct or prevent so that you can pick products to address them.for instance  do you want to get rid of acne  acne scars  rosacea  dark spots or pigmentation  are there wrinkles or other signs of aging that you d like to address  would you like to minimize large pores or treat blackheads  is the skin under your eyes puffy or discolored     is your skin fair  light  medium  or dark  while this won t make a difference for many products  it s useful to keep in mind when you re buying products that are tinted to match your skin  such as tinted moisturizers . it s also helpful to think about when considering the degree of sun protection that you d like your skin care products to provide.if you have fair skin  it s likely that you burn easily and should go for a skin care line that offers a high spf of 30 . if you re light or medium in complexion  pick products that offer some protection in the 15 30 spf range. if you have darker skin and only rarely burn  you can choose a line with minimal to no sun protection.    make sure that you keep notes about your skin assessments for your reference. many skin care products are made to address specific skin care needs and issues. you want to have your skin type  condition  and tone on hand as you select beauty products to help you make the best choices.   for example  your skin may be dry but also sensitive  so you need products designed for both dry and sensitive skin  as opposed to something heavy that may be hydrating but also irritating. perhaps your skin is combination and patchy in its coloring. you may want products that balance the skin s moisture and tone.    besides knowing your skin needs  it s important to know your budget when it comes to skin care. prices for skin care products can vary greatly  ranging anywhere from a few dollars to a few hundred or more. figuring out your minimum and maximum expenditure is very useful for limiting your skin care options.for example  facial moisturizers alone can run you anywhere from less than  10  like purpose dual treatment moisture lotion  to around  50  like lancome bienfait multi vital sunscreen cream  to more than  100  such as tracie martyn re sculpting cream .as a general rule  product lines carried at salons  boutiques  high end department stores  and spas tend to cost more than those on the shelves of your local pharmacy or discount retailer.    organic products must use all natural materials that have not been genetically modified  synthetically produced  or grown with pesticides or chemical fertilizers. while there is no evidence that they are more effective than other types of skin care products  some people prefer organic lines because of their lack of potentially toxic chemical ingredients and ethical  environmentally sound production standards.the use of the word  organic  on product labels is highly regulated by the usda  so you can be confident that the product that advertises itself as such meets a strict code. however  words like  natural    non toxic   or  hypoallergenic  are not regulated. since they have no set legal definition  it s important to treat them as marketing terms rather than specific factual claims.    when you re looking for a skin care line  you should pick those products that have active ingredients that have been clinically proven to be effective. be sure to check the labels to ensure that the lines you are considering have at least 5 15  concentrations of safe and effective active ingredients.the most important active ingredients are vitamins a  b  c  and e  but they will most likely take on different names on product labels. for vitamin a  which helps with moisturizing  acne  rosacea  and dermatitis  look for retinoic acid  retinol  or retinyl propionate. for vitamins b   b5  which moisturize while addressing acne  itchiness  eczema  and sunburn  look for niacin  nicotinamide  pantothenic acid  or panthenol. for vitamin c  which enhances skin texture while decreasing wrinkles and sun damage  look for l ascorbic acid. for vitamin e  which moisturizes and helps prevent wrinkles  look for di alpha tocopherol. do not use products that include tocopherol acetate  since this form of vitamin e is especially susceptible to degradation from sunlight and can therefore actually cause damage to your skin.    the most basic  line  will pair a cleanser with a moisturizer. if you re looking for a more complete regime that can address more specific issues  you can consider adding on toners  exfoliators  serums  and or specific treatments  for instance  for nights  wrinkles  under eye puffing and discoloration  or acne .the amount of product you get should correspond with both your skin care needs and lifestyle. more comprehensive lines will be more costly to purchase and time consuming to administer.    now that you ve done your homework  it s time to start finding the right products to match your needs and preferences. the best way to do so is to take all of your requirements with you to a pharmacy  beauty shop  department store  salons  or skin care center where you can consult with an esthetician. tell them your needs and preferences  and ask for their advice about which skin care lines would offer the best fit for you.for instance  when you approach an esthetician for advice  you could say something like   hi  i m looking for an inexpensive line of skin care products. i ve got dry  sensitive skin that s very fair. i m looking for products that can address wrinkles and other signs of aging while providing sun protection. do you have any recommendations and samples i could try   or   hello  can you help me  i ve got dark  combination skin that s prone to acne. could you suggest some appropriate skin care products that are under  100   avoid salespeople who represent a particular line. you want advice from someone who is unbiased and knowledgeable about multiple brands. ask for multiple options with a range of price points that fit in your budget. keep your budget in mind when picking where to go for recommendations. over the counter lines at pharmacies and beauty shops will be less expensive than those offered exclusively by salons or skin care centers. however  the latter will be more likely to have qualified experts to guide you. many skin care centers will offer free consultations if you make an appointment in advance.    one of the nice things about consulting with an esthetician in person is that they will likely be able to give you samples of the skin care options that they recommend to you. while you won t be able to judge the long term effects of particular products  there s nothing like being able to test first hand if you like the general look and feel of a product as well as if the skin care routine associated with the line works for you.if you re sampling more than one line  keep notes about your impressions of each as you test them. list any pros and or cons about how the products make your skin look and feel to help you make your final decision. for example  when you re evaluating a cleanser  you may write something like   pros  nice fragrance  good lather  rinses off cleanly. cons  dries out skin.  if you re taking notes on a moisturizer  you might write   pros  pleasant feel and texture  all day hydration  sun protection. cons  makes skin shiny around t zone.     samples will give you a preliminary first hand impression  but if you want to hear more about customers  long term satisfaction with the line  seek out reviews.most online stores that sell multiple skin care lines  such as amazon or sephora  will enable customer reviews to lend credibility to the products on offer. search for a particular product to see how it rates  and read the written reviews to see the volume of reviewers and hear why they gave the ratings they did. there are also some product reviews available from skin care experts. do an online search for your product s name    review  to see if it has been evaluated by an unbiased expert. only consider those reviews that include the author s skin care credentials and indicate that they have no financial ties to the brand being reviewed.    see if the product packaging lists any potential side effects that you should be aware of. besides looking at customer reviews  research the safety of your line through databases that conduct independent testing of skin care products.some skin care products may alleviate a specific problem quickly but may not be best for long term use. see if this is the case for your line before you commit to it. try consumerlab.com  an independent review site that tests health and nutritional products  for reports on your skin care line. search for a particular product and or active ingredient in it to ensure that your line is

query	87	overcome speech disorder overcome your weaknesses  as you go through life  some things will go the way you want and others won t. making a list of your failures or shortcomings can point you in the direction of your weaknesses. write down anything in life that didn t turn out the way you had hoped.for example  if you continuously fail to keep a relationship going for more than a few months  write that down.    if your shortcomings have a common thread  this is a clear weakness. now that you ve identified that weakness you can start developing a strategy to work on it. when you overcome the weakness  there s a better chance that your future outcomes will be what you want.for example  if you struggle to get along with family and coworkers  you might be weak in communication skills.    you might not always recognize your own weaknesses. sometimes  it helps if you ask for feedback from people that know you well. get the opinion of your boss  your spouse  or anyone else that you know well.   avoid becoming defensive when asking for feedback. thank the other person for their honest advice  and they will be more likely to be open with you in the future.    if there are areas of life that make you unhappy  it may be because you feel weak or unsuited to handle those areas well. make a note of such things and see if there is any correlation between your weaknesses and the changes you want to make. you will likely find that these changes all stem from an area that you are not well suited to handle.for example  if you wish your house was cleaner and your office was less cluttered  it isn t a stretch to say that you might have a weakness in organization. finding that weakness is the first step to overcoming it.    your mind does not create weaknesses on purpose. these traits are created in an attempt to protect you or serve you in some way. the sooner you understand what that is  the sooner you can find a more positive way to cope with that situations  leaving no need for your current weakness.for example  a weakness in approaching strangers could stem from being taught that strangers are dangerous and that protecting yourself meant staying away from them. remember that nobody can be perfect at everything. if you struggle with certain skills or subjects  consider your strengths instead. for example  you may not be good at math  but you can celebrate how good you are at writing.    there are multiple ways to look at any task or situation. instead of focusing on skills that you lack  try tackling tasks with the skills you do have. this can build your confidence and make you capable of doing more things that you thought possible.for example  if you are intimidated by math but great with computers  you can tackle budget related tasks by plugging everything into a spreadsheet and letting it do the math for you.    networking with others is a strength in any situation. admitting that you need help in a certain area will help you to include team members and other partners in your tasks. you can also learn to overcome your weaknesses by observing how others tackle those tasks.if you find it difficult to reach out or to rely on others  this might be your weakness  you can take steps to learn how to depend on others.     you can take a class  workshop  or training to develop some skills. you could also seek out a mentor to help you grow as a person and overcome your weaknesses. you can also read a self help book or online coaching materials. if your weaknesses are the result of emotional roots  you could even see a counselor to help you work through these underlying issues.a therapist or mental health professional can help you identify your patterns and habits so that you can make positive changes in your life.    once your weaknesses are identified  you need a plan to beat them. set goals for yourself with time limits. under each goal  create actionable steps that allow you to stay on track and succeed.for example  if your public speaking skills are weak  make it a goal that you can give a confident presentation. you can plan out actionable steps like writing a speech  delivering the speech to an empty room  then to one person  then to several people. eventually  you ll be confident enough to deliver the speech to a public audience. tell other people about your goals to make yourself accountable for them. you may even ask a trusted friend or mentor to be an accountability partner. they should check in every now and then to see how far you have progressed.    while you are working to overcome a weakness  work on things you are good at  too. this will keep your confidence up and help you get back to work overcoming the weaknesses. it also keeps you looking competent and skilled while you build your skillset even more.for example  if you are really good at writing speeches  you could help others write their speeches until you feel comfortable delivering your own.    your weaknesses are called weaknesses for a reason. it takes hard work and dedication to overcome them. even if you fall short of a goal  acknowledge any progress that you did make. this will keep you in a positive frame of mind and help you pick up and continue overcoming the weakness.even if you haven t mastered the art of speaking to large crowds  give yourself credit when you speak up in a meeting or give a presentation to your colleagues. celebrate all of your successes. you can do this by taking photographs to commemorate them  making social media posts  or going out to dinner with friends.  
query	88	reduce spinal muscular atrophy treat upper back pain  upper back pain is often caused by repetitive motions at work or minor injuries related to playing sports or vigorous exercise. as a first measure  take a break from the activity that may have resulted in the strain and rest for a few days. if your problem is work related  talk to your boss about switching to a different activity or improving the ergonomics of your work station. if the pain is exercise related  you may be working out too aggressively or with bad form. in this case  consult with a professional trainer or sports therapist.   total bed rest is not a good idea for any type of back pain because some movement  even just leisurely walks  is needed to stimulate blood flow and healing.practice better posture at work and at home. sit up straight and don t slouch or lean to one side excessively. examine your sleeping conditions. mattresses that are too soft or pillows that are too thick may contribute to upper back pain. avoid sleeping on your stomach as it can cause the head and neck to twist in ways that aggravate back pain.    non steroidal anti inflammatories  nsaids  such as ibuprofen  naproxen  or aspirin can be short term solutions to help you deal with pain or inflammation in your upper back. keep in mind that these medications can be hard on your stomach  kidneys  and liver  so it s best not to use them for more than two weeks at a stretch.   dosage for adults is usually 200   400 mg  by mouth  every four to six hours.alternatively  you can try over the counter analgesics such as acetaminophen  tylenol  or muscle relaxants  such as cyclobenzaprine  for your upper back pain  but never take them when you are taking nsaids. be careful not to take any medications on an empty stomach  as they can irritate the lining of your stomach and increase the risk of ulcers.    the application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all minor musculoskeletal injuries  including upper back pain. cold therapy is most effective for acute injuries  injuries that have occurred in the last 48 hours . cold therapy should be applied to the tender part of your upper back in order to reduce the swelling and pain. ice should be applied for 20 minutes every two to three hours for a couple of days  then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside.compressing the ice against your back with a wrap around elastic support will also help control the inflammation. always wrap ice or frozen gel packs in a thin towel in order to prevent frostbite on your skin.    soaking your back in a warm epsom salt bath can significantly reduce pain and swelling  especially if the pain is caused by muscle strain.the magnesium in the salt helps the muscles relax. don t make the water too hot  to prevent scalding  and don t soak in the bath for much more than 30 minutes because the salty water will pull fluid from your body and start to dehydrate you.   if swelling is a particular problem in your upper back  then follow the warm salt bath with cold therapy until your back feels numb  about 15 minutes or so .    stretching the affected area of your back might reverse the condition  especially if you address the problem during its early stages. use slow  steady movements and take deep breaths during your stretches. in general  hold stretches for about 30 seconds and repeat three to five times daily.   kneel on a padded surface with your buttocks resting on the soles of your feet. then bend forward at the waist  walking your fingers forward as far as you can go while trying to touch your nose to the floor. while standing  place both hands behind your head and slowly push your head backwards while arching or extending your spine so that your stomach sticks out. while standing with your feet shoulder width apart  for stability and balance   place your arms in front of you  bent at the elbows  and in a controlled fashion  rotate your upper body as far as you can in one direction  then switch and do the other way a few seconds later.    rolling on a piece of firm foam is a good way to massage your back and potentially relieve mild to moderate discomfort  especially in the mid back  thoracic  region. foam rollers are commonly used in physiotherapy  yoga and pilates.pick up a foam roller at a sporting goods or big box store   they re very inexpensive and nearly indestructible. place the foam roller on the ground  perpendicular to where you re going to lay your body. lie down on your back so that the foam roller is beneath your shoulders. your body and the roller should form a  t  shape. put your feet flat on the floor  bend your knees  and lift up your lower back so it rolls over the foam in a back and forth manner. use your feet to move your body over the foam  so that your entire spine is massaged  at least 10 minutes . repeat as many times as necessary  although your muscles might be a little sore after the first time you use a foam roller.    medical specialists such as an orthopedist  neurologist  or rheumatologist may be needed to rule out the most serious causes of your upper back pain  such as infection  osteomyelitis   cancer  osteoporosis  spinal fracture  herniated disc  or rheumatoid arthritis.these conditions are not common causes of upper back pain  but if home care and conservative therapies are not effective  then more serious problems need to be considered.   x rays  bone scans  mri  ct scan and ultrasound are modalities that specialists may use to help diagnose your upper back pain. your doctor may also send you for a blood test to rule out rheumatoid arthritis or a spinal infection.    your upper back pain may be caused by chronic joint inflammation. a facet joint injection involves real time fluoroscopic  x ray  guidance of a needle through the back muscles and into the inflamed or irritated spinal joint  followed by a release of an anesthetic and corticosteroid mixture  which quickly relieves both pain and inflammation at the site. facet joint injections take 20   30 minutes to do and the results can last from a few weeks to a few months.facet joint injections are limited to three within a six month time frame. the pain relief benefits from facet joint injections typically begin on the second or third day post treatment. until that time  your back pain may get a little worse. potential complications of facet joint injections include infection  bleeding  local muscle atrophy  and nerve irritation damage.    scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine that usually occurs in young people before puberty.it can cause pain in the upper and middle back. you may not notice mild forms of scoliosis  but even mild scoliosis can cause pain or worsen over time  leading to more serious complications such as lung and heart damage or changes to the body s appearance  such as uneven shoulders and hips and a prominent rib cage.the doctor will check for scoliosis by asking the person to bend forward at the waist so he can see if one side of the ribs sticks out more than the other side.the doctor may also check for muscle weakness  numbness  and abnormal reflexes.learn more about managing pain caused by scoliosis by reading this article  relieve back pain from scoliosis.    surgery for back pain is the last resort and should only be considered after all other conservative therapies are proven ineffective and if the cause warrants such invasive techniques.reasons for upper back surgery may include to repair or stabilize a fracture  from trauma or osteoporosis   to remove a tumor  to repair a herniated disc  or to combat a deformity such as scoliosis.   spinal surgery may involve the use of metal rods  pins or other devices for structural support. possible complications from back surgery include local infection  allergic reaction to anesthesia  nerve damage  paralysis  and chronic swelling and or pain.    a strained muscle occurs when individual muscle fibers are taken beyond their tensile limits and subsequently tear  which leads to pain  inflammation and some degree of guarding  muscle spasm in attempts to prevent further damage . a deep tissue massage is helpful for mild to moderate strains because it reduces muscle spasm  combats inflammation  and promotes relaxation.start with a 30 minute massage  focusing on your upper back and lower neck areas. allow the therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate without wincing.   always drink lots of water immediately following a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by products  lactic acid  and toxins from your body. failure to do so might cause a headache or mild nausea. as an alternative to professional massage therapy  position a tennis ball underneath your body and between your shoulder blades  or wherever your upper back pain is . roll on the ball slowly for 10   15 minutes a few times daily until the pain subsides.    chiropractors and osteopaths are spinal specialists that focus on establishing normal motion and function of the small spinal joints that connect the vertebrae  called spinal facet joints.manual joint manipulation  also called an adjustment  can be used to unjam or reposition facet joints that are slightly misaligned  which triggers inflammation and sharp pain  particularly with movement. you can often hear a  popping  sound with a spinal adjustment. traction techniques or stretching of your spine may also help your upper back pain.   although a single spinal adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your back issue  more than likely it will take three to five treatments to notice significant results. chiropractors and osteopaths also use a variety of therapies tailored more towards muscle strains  which may be more appropriate for your upper back issue. a chiropractor or osteopath may help with improving mobility in the joints.    if your upper back problem is recurring  chronic  and caused by weak spinal

query	89	increase testosterone get more testosterone  how much testosterone your body produces has a lot to do with diet  so it s important to become aware of exactly what you re eating. a good testosterone friendly diet includes plenty of healthy fats  green leafy vegetables  protein and cholesterol  it s not all bad  . low fat diets should be avoided when trying to boost testosterone.   for example  minerals such as zinc and magnesium help to get testosterone production started  while a healthy level of cholesterol allows your leydig cells to actually make testosterone. in addition  veggies such as broccoli  cauliflower and cabbage work to lower the levels of estrogen  a female hormone  in your body  thus boosting testosterone levels.    incorporating a handful or two of walnuts or almonds into your daily diet is a great  easy way to increase testosterone levels.   also try branching out to brazil nuts  cashews  peanuts and other nuts high in monounsaturated fats  as men who regularly consume these fats have higher testosterone levels than men who don t.seeds  such as sunflower and sesame seeds  also provide high levels of monounsaturated fats  in addition to protein  vitamin e and zinc  all of which boost testosterone. for the healthiest option  go for the unflavored  unsalted versions of nuts and seeds.    zinc is one of the most important minerals your body needs for the production of testosterone. in fact  increasing your zinc intake can significantly raise testosterone levels in as little as six weeks.if you re looking for a quick fix  six oysters is all the boost your body needs to produce more testosterone  as oysters contain loads of zinc.but if shellfish isn t your thing  you can also increase your zinc intake by eating protein rich meats and fish  along with raw dairy products such as milk and cheese  all of which contain high levels of zinc. if you re finding it difficult to increase your zinc intake through diet alone  especially as a vegan or vegetarian  you can help the process along by taking a zinc supplement. the recommended intake for adults is no more than 40 mg per day.    the health benefits of oatmeal are well known   it is high in fiber and low in fat   but now there is one more reason to start your day with a bowl of oats  a 2012 study has shown that oatmeal is linked with increased levels of testosterone.   the study found evidence that compounds in oats called avenacosides can limit the level of sex hormone binding globulins in the system  thus increasing testosterone levels.oatmeal has also been shown to improve sexual performance. it loaded with l arginine  an amino acid that reacts with nitric oxide to relax blood vessels. when those blood vessels expand  blood flow is increased mightily.    eggs are basically a testosterone producing superfood. their yolks contain high levels of hdl  a.k.a. the  good  type of cholesterol  which forms the building blocks of testosterone production.   in addition  eggs are high in protein and loaded with zinc   two more testosterone producing essentials. don t worry about your arteries   eating  good  cholesterol will not raise your blood cholesterol levels  unlike  bad  cholesterol such as triglycerides  so you can eat up to three whole eggs a day without compromising your health.    cabbage  along with other leafy green veg such as spinach and kale  can do wonders for your testosterone levels. it contains a phytochemical called indole 3 carbinol  ic3  which has the dual effect of increasing male hormones while decreasing female ones.   specifically  a study conducted at rockefeller university hospital showed that estrogen levels were reduced by up to 50  in men who took 500 mg of ic3 a week  thus making existing testosterone levels much more effective. the most effective way to increase your ic3 levels at home is to eat plenty of cabbage  so try making cabbage soup  cabbage rolls  cabbage juice  or good old cabbage and potatoes.    scientists have found that obese men are 2.4 times more likely to have low testosterone than their counterparts  so it s important that you attempt to shed any extra pounds in order to increase testosterone.the fastest way to do this is to cut as much processed sugar from your diet as possible.   if you are an avid soda drinker  that should be the first thing to go. sodas are filled with processed sugars and empty calories  which lead to insulin resistance and weight gain. just by cutting your daily can of soda from your diet  you could be eliminating a ton of calories. fructose is a type of sugar found in processed foods and fruit juices. it is believed to be one of the major factors behind modern day obesity. to decrease your fructose intake  cut out processed food and drinks  along with refined carbohydrates found in breakfast cereals  bagels  pretzels  waffles etc.   it s technically a hormone  but a really important one at that. studies show that people who regularly take d3 supplements actually have higher testosterone levels.  while they may be in vogue  they certainly don t help your little helpers produce more t. these are the things you should stay away from    vitamin c. unless you have diabetes  you won t benefit much from taking this supplement to boost your testosterone. while it may be beneficial in boosting t in diabetic rats  that s about the extent of the scientific evidence.you re most likely getting enough vitamin c from your diet. zma. zma is a supplement blend of zinc  magnesium  and vitamin b6. recent studies have found that zma has absolutely no effect on the production of testosterone in men.unless you know you have deficiencies in any one of these categories  steer clear.  do your research. research supplements that claim to help raise testosterone levels. if you re unsure  be your own advocate and make an informed decision. just because it s out there on the internet does not make it true.    if you re hoping to increase your testosterone levels  diet isn t the only thing to consider. exercise is an equally important part of increasing testosterone levels  which is why you should come up with an effective  yet sustainable fitness plan designed to maximize testosterone production.   specific types of exercise  such as weightlifting  actually cause the body to produce more testosterone. exercising decreases your chances of being overweight and  as discussed above  being overweight can negatively impact testosterone levels.if you re not sure where to begin  it may be a good idea to enlist the services of a personal trainer who can develop an exercise plan specifically tailored to your current fitness level  along with your desired outcome.    if you want to boost testosterone  you should begin to lift weights  as weight lifting is the most effective form of exercise for increasing testosterone production. however  for best results  you will need to lift heavier weights with fewer repetitions  and it s probably best to avoid the weight machines altogether. stick with free weights and follow the advice below     lift large muscle groups. studies show that lifting larger muscle groups  which require complex  compound movements  is much more effective for producing testosterone than working just one or two smaller muscles.for this reason  you should stick with weight exercises such as bench presses  squats  deadlifts  and shoulder presses.  try to work out with high volume. the type of exercises you perform will mean nothing if you don t have enough volume. you should be doing at least 3 to 4 sets of each compound exercise  using a weight you can only lift 5 times per set. the volume of your workout is determined by this formula  reps x sets x weight   volume. however  when it comes down to a choice between more repetitions or more sets  you should choose more sets every time.  focus on high intensity. push yourself hard in the gym   only by pushing yourself to your physical limit will you maximize your testosterone production. increase intensity by performing each exercise more slowly and by resting for no longer than two minutes between sets  high intensity interval training  or hiit  is another form of exercise which can actively increase testosterone levels  in addition to improving fitness and speeding up the metabolism.   hiit involves performing an exercise in a short  intense burst then following it up with an easier  recovery exercise. this process is then repeated several times throughout the workout.this type of exercising can be adapted for most types of exercise   you can perform hiit on the treadmill  the elliptical  in the swimming pool  etc. just use the following formula  perform the high intensity exercise for approximately 30 seconds  then follow it up with approximately 90 seconds of slower recovery exercise. repeat this 7 more times for best results.even 20 minutes of this type of exercise can reap huge rewards   so there s no excuse for not finding the time.    while cardio exercise won t have a huge impact on testosterone production  it can still have a positive impact on overall testosterone levels. as a result  you should try to incorporate some running  swimming  spinning or other aerobic exercise into your fitness plan.   cardio is one of the best ways to burn fat  so incorporating a little running or swimming into your weekly exercise plan will help you to shed any extra pounds. this is good news  as being overweight can negatively impact testosterone. when you re stressed  your body releases a chemical called cortisol which  amongst other things  inhibits testosterone production. cardio exercise is also a great form of stress relief so it can reduce your body s cortisol production  thus increasing testosterone. however  cardio should be practiced in moderation   there s no need to become a long distance runner. in fact  a study conducted by the university of british columbia found that male runners who ran more than 40 miles  64 km  per weeks had lower levels of testosterone than short distance runners.  despite the importance of exercise  it is imperative that you give your body the time it needs to recover between workouts. otherwise  your exercise regime may be having a negative effect on your testosterone levels.   a study conducted by the university of north carolina found that over training can decrease men s testosterone levels by up to 40 . therefore  it is very important that you take at least two days off from intense exercise per week  and that you avoid working the same muscle groups in two consecutive training sessions.on days when you re not exercising intensely  just try to be more more active than usual. take the stairs instead of the elevator  walk or bike to work  use a standing desk instead of sitting down all day. these small changes help to keep your body moving  which is good news for testosterone levels.    sleep is a very important factor when it comes to testosterone levels. this is because your body uses the time you re asleep to produce more testosterone. therefore  you should do your very best to get at least 7 to 8 hours sleep a night.   a study conducted at the university of chicago found that men who spent less than 5 hours sleeping for 7 consecutive nights produced 10  to 15  less testosterone compared to when they were fully rested.in addition to decreased testosterone production  being sleep deprived also increases the amount of cortisol  the stress hormone  in your system  and high levels of cortisol negatively impact testosterone levels. not getting enough sleep also interferes with your growth hormones  which can prevent you from building muscle when you work out.you should also try to improve the quality of your sleep by turning off all computers and electronics an hour before bed  avoiding caffeinated drinks late in the evening  and having a hot shower before bed.    many experts believe that stress is one of the major contributing factors in the widespread fall in testosterone levels in modern day men. this is because the hormone which causes stress   cortisol   has been found to have an inverse relationship with testosterone.   in other words  when cortisol levels are high  testosterone levels are low  and vice versa. it is believed that cortisol  which puts your body in  fight or flight  survival mode  conflicts with testosterone related behaviors such as aggression  competition and mating. this is why the two cannot co exist harmoniously.in order to maximize testosterone levels  it is important to minimize stress in any way you can. consider trying deep breathing techniques  meditation  yoga or visualization.    alcohol can have a negative impact on your testosterone production. binge drinking can negatively affect the endocrine system  which  in turn  prevents the testes from producing testosterone.   in addition  alcohol raises cortisol levels and inhibits growth hormones   bad news for testosterone. unfortunately  beer is the worst type of alcohol when it comes to healthy testosterone. this is because the hops used to make beer are full of estrogen  the female hormone . so you might switch to drinking liquor instead  or nothing at all.when drinking  it s best to cut yourself off after two three drinks  as this will limit the damage to your testosterone levels.    caffeine needs to be taken in moderation  otherwise it can produce cortisol  which negatively impacts testosterone levels.in addition  consuming too much caffeine late in the day can disrupt sleeping patterns   and less sleep means less testosterone. however  recent studies have shown that consuming caffeine before a workout can actually boost your performance   so if you re really craving a cup of coffee  have one before you pump iron.   luckily  increasing your testosterone levels doesn t have to be all work and no play. there are several enjoyable things you can do to boost your t.    watch more sports. researchers at the university of utah have found that the testosterone levels of sports fans are linked with their favorite team s performance. the testosterone levels of the research subjects increased by up to 20  when their team won  but decreased by the same percentage when their team lost. therefore you should feel completely justified in watching more sports   as long as you re sure your team will win have more sex. you probably know that testosterone is what fuels men s sex drive  but did you know that it also works the other way around  that s right  having sex can actually increase your testosterone levels. and not only that   just the fact of having an erection  or getting turned on by an attractive woman is enough to boost testosterone.enjoy the great outdoors. getting outside and enjoying the sunshine can be hugely beneficial to testosterone. in fact  exposing yourself to those vitamin d filled rays for just 15 to 20 minutes a day can increase t levels by a whopping 120 . if you can sunbathe naked  the results are even higher. just don t get caught.  studies have found that men with high blood pressure are 1.8 times likelier to have low testosterone than their counterparts.there are specific diets than you can start on   such as the dash diet   in order to decrease your high blood pressure and improve your testosterone levels. other factors such as reducing stress  cutting out booze and alcohol  and maintaining a healthy weight can all help to reduce blood pressure. and if all else fails  blood pressure medication can help to keep your hypertension under control. see your doctor to figure out the best course of action for you.    xenoestrogens are chemicals that mimic the effects of estrogen in the body  which is bad news for your testosterone levels. unfortunately xenoestrogens  like other endocrine disruptors  have infiltrated almost every part of daily lives and are impossible to avoid completely. here are some ways you can limit your exposure    avoid heating food in plastic containers. if you re heating up leftovers  make sure to transfer your food to a plate before popping in the microwave. most plastic containers contain phthalates  a type of xenoestrogen  which can be transferred to your food when the plastic is heated. if possible  store your food in glass containers instead. limit exposure to pesticides and gasoline. both of these contain xenoestrogens  so try to limit your exposure as much as possible. if you come in contact with either  wash your hands thoroughly afterwards. eat organic produce. non organic foods are often sprayed with pesticides and pumped with hormones which mimic the effects of estrogen in the body. choose organic product when possible  or at least wash fruit and veg thoroughly before eating and avoid meat and dairy products which come from cows that have been treated with hormones. use natural grooming products. items such as shampoos  soaps  toothpastes and deodorants can introduce xenoestrogens to the body  so consider making the switch to more natural versions of these products.  if you believe you may be suffering from a condition called low t  consult with your doctor. your doctor will be able to prescribe medicine that will help your body produce more of its super hormone.  
query	90	produce thyroid hormone heal your thyroid naturally  the thyroid depends on good nutrition to get the iodine  selenium and vitamins it needs to function properly. without the proper nutritive balance  the thyroid cannot do its job properly.   make time for nutrition. while it is not always the simplest thing to do  you will be doing you and your family a great service by making your own food and encouraging everyone in your family to follow a healthier diet.    processing in general adds sugar to foods. this can worsen any thyroid problems. it takes a bit of practice and planning

your blood  a digital rectal exam  dte  to feel for prostate abnormalities  and or a cystoscopy  a tube inserted into the bladder via the urethra to check for a tumor . if the doctor finds a tumor in

body mass index  points as a result of gastric bypass surgery had regained urinary continence by one year after the procedure.  urination occurs by a complex arc of nerves communicating with the brain and causing muscles within the bladder and surrounding areas to contract and relax. if you have a neuromuscular disorder such as multiple sclerosis  ms   for example you may experience disruptions in these signals  resulting in a neurogenic bladder. people who have had a stroke can also have a resultant neurogenic bladder if the muscles that cause the bladder muscles to contract and relax are affected.    most of those who have a neurogenic bladder will already be familiar with the underlying causes. however  you should still see your doctor for a positive diagnosis. you doctor will also

stay close to a bathroom  as well as times when you should force yourself to go  to minimize incontinence episodes.    though no drugs currently target the bladder sphincter to help with neurogenic bladder  some drugs do reduce muscle spasms or induce contractions. your doctor will help determine if one of these classes of medications can help with your specific case.    a variety of difference surgical options are available  depending upon the underlying cause for your neurogenic bladder. your doctor may discuss    electrical stimulatory therapy  which involves electrodes and a small stimulator implanted to help deliver the signals disrupted by the damaged nerves an artificial sphincter  which is a cuff that attaches to the neck of the bladder and works in coordination with an implanted pump and regulating balloon to collect the urine.    an overactive bladder  oab  is a syndrome which leads to an immediate and unstoppable need to urinate.common symptoms of the syndrome include urinary urgency  primary symptom  urgency incontinence  not making it to the toilet quickly enough  high urinary frequency and nocturia  getting up at night to go     your doctor will help you officially diagnose oab as the underlying cause. only 2  of men who suffer from oab experience regular symptoms of incontinence  so your doctor will want to exhaust other potential causes.your doctor will likely perform a physical exam  as well as ordering urinalysis to test your urine and potentially even a cystoscopy in complicated cases.findings also suggest the overactivity of the detrusor muscle  which is found in the wall of the bladder.  treatment involves behavioral therapy with a timed voiding regimen. a timed voiding regimen involves going to urinate at set times for example  every four hours whether or not you actually feel the need to empty your bladder.   this is a bladder retraining regimen  and a form of cognitive behavior therapy. trying to train the bladder to empty at certain times to prevent incontinence. a recent report has shown that biofeedback assisted behavioral therapy  timed voiding  was shown to be superior to pharmacologic therapy with oxybutynin or placebo in patients receiving treatment for detrusor instability.biofeedback is when a patient is attached to some electrodes that measure their subjective  unconscious physiologic responses. that way they can see in plain sight when their body is having a physiologic response  such as the urge to urinate  and attend to their needs  versus a  false alarm.  this ability to see factual data rather than guessing increases their accuracy of judging their bodies cues.    there are some pharmacologic interventions  specifically ditropan  which is dosed as 5 mg twice daily or 5 mg extended release tablet once daily. combination therapies  using combination of behavioral  pharmacologic  and biofeedback are common.

query	97	sell big oil buy commodities  a commodity is simply a good that is interchangeable with other commodities of the same type  and that is usually produced and sold by many different companies. for example  a barrel of oil of one particular type  such as brent crude  is the same product regardless of who makes it.this is opposed to a consumer product like a computer or automobile  for example. these products differ dramatically between producers and cannot be easily exchanged for one another. note that while the quality and characteristics may vary somewhat between types of a particular commodity  for example  brent crude oil is typically higher quality than west texas intermediate crude   producers would be generally willing to exchange products of the same type with one another. there are many different types of commodities. they include  but aren t limited to  gold  oil  natural gas  coal  copper  zinc  potash  nitrogen  phosphate  live cattle  hogs  orange juice  cotton  sugar  and even coffee.    commodities offer an opportunity for both diversification and profit. commodities are an asset class  like stocks  bonds  cash equivalents  or real estate. each asset class has different properties  and owning commodities can be a useful way to diversify your portfolio.   commodities don t always move in the same directions as other asset classes. for example  when the stock market falls 30   it is possible that a commodity like gold could stay flat  or even rise. the fact that commodities are not strongly correlated to other asset classes makes them a great way to diversify your portfolio. commodities are also a useful way to protect against inflation. inflation essentially refers to the cost of goods increasing over time  due to money losing value   and as inflation increases  so do commodity prices. it is for this reason that people who are worried about inflation often buy commodities. commodities can also be traded to make a short term profit. they are extremely volatile  meaning that their prices move around a lot   and as a result people looking to make a short term profit look to capitalize on these swings. this volatility is due to the fact that commodities are heavily traded and speculated on  which leads to more movement in the prices. commodity investment can also be used as a method of hedging. hedging requires taking a position in a futures contract opposite your position in the real commodity. for example  a farmer may buy wheat futures when he plants his crop to make delivery of wheat when it is harvested. as a consequence  he is protected against price changes while the wheat is in the ground.  commodities as an asset class are considered high risk due to their price volatility and leverage compared to other investments. over a very short period of time  commodities can gain  or lose dramatic amounts of value.for example  between the beginning of june and the beginning of september 2015  the price of crude oil lost 26 . at the start of september 2015  crude oil then shot up 4.5  in one day. it is because of this risk that commodity investing or trading is typically for more sophisticated investors. one popular way in which commodities are purchased is through what is called a futures contract  and futures investing involves a high amount of leverage  which basically means that the majority of the investment is made with borrowed money . essentially  using leverage on a futures contracts magnifies your potential gains or losses and therefore is even riskier than non leveraged commodity investments.  an etf stands for an exchange traded fund  and these  along with mutual funds  are both  baskets  of investments. when you buy a mutual fund or etf you are purchasing a collection of different types of investments  which could include commodity stocks  non commodity stocks  bonds  or direct commodities..   with a mutual fund  the basket of investments is managed by a professional investor who actively monitors and changes the investments  and you purchase units in the fund. the value of your units then goes up or down depending on whether or not the basket of investments goes up or down. an etf is similar to a mutual fund  except many etfs often do not have a manager actively buying and selling depending on their goals. instead  etfs often track something known as an index. an index  like the dow jones or s p 500 index  simply indicates how a group of investments are doing. for example  the s   p 500 index contains the prices of the largest 500 companies in the u.s. when you hear  the s   p is up 10 points   it simply means combined price of all those businesses is up  10. there are also commodity indexes that do the exact same thing. a complete commodity index  for example  would simply indicate what the combined prices of all commodities are doing. a complete commodity etf would simply go up and down with that index  since it owns the same commodities that the index tracks.    the main benefit to purchasing commodities through etfs or mutual funds is simplicity. mutual funds and etfs are bought and sold just like stocks  and they do not require you to own the commodity itself. .   etfs and mutual funds also allow you to own one  many  or all commodities in one basket  due to the huge range of products available. for example  there are etfs that contain all commodities  and some that just contain oil  or gold for example. purchasing an etf or mutual fund that owns multiple commodities can also be much less risky than simply owning one commodity  since commodities do not all go up and down together. this is because each commodity has different supply and demand forces determining the price  which means on one day gold may be up  and potash may be down  for example. the main risk of etfs and mutual funds lies in the fact that at the end of the day  these funds still hold commodities  which can be volatile and risky. while owning an etf or mutual that holds a basket of different commodities can reduce risk  the risk of losing some or most of your investment is always there.    the first step in buying commodity etfs or mutual funds is to open an online trading account. there are multiple brokers available  and commonly used brokers are td ameritrade  capital one investing  e trade  charles schwab  and tradeking.   when choosing an broker to open a trading account with  always be mindful of fees. fees are typically charged per trade  and can range from  4.95 to  10.00. stockbrokers.com is an excellent resource to compare brokers  and their fees. there is a minimum balance requirement you must meet in order to trade commodities on most platforms. at some brokerage firms this can be as much as ten thousand dollars. check with your broker to find out how much you will need to deposit. many brokers require a confirmation of an investor s experience before opening an account to trade commodity futures and options. most brokers have completely online registration that simply involve filling out information  and then funding the account with money from your bank account. you can also download the forms  complete the information  and then mail it back to the brokerage firm. wait for approval from the brokerage firm.    there are thousands of available products to accomplish this. to determine which is right for you  you need to ask yourself what your goals are. for example  do you want exposure to all commodities as a way to diversify your portfolio  or are you looking to profit from a specific commodity gaining in value    if you are looking for broad exposure to many commodities  consider etfs that contain a small sample of every commodity. one example would be the ishares s p gsci commodity indexed trust etf or the powershares db commodity index tracking fund. these funds each contain many commodities and are good ways to gain access to the entire commodity market. if you want exposure to only one commodity  such as oil for example  etfdb.com can be a very useful resource to find complete lists of all the etfs that give you exposure to just one commodity. alternatively  doing a google search for the name of the commodity you want to invest in  followed by the word etf can yield many examples of etfs to consider.    once your brokerage account is opened  and you have selected a product you want  you can proceed to purchase. while the exact procedure varies between brokers  the basic process remains similar.   start by opening a new order. once an order is open  enter the ticker symbol for the investment you want to buy. google the name of the etf to locate the ticker symbol. once you enter the symbol  you will need to enter the amount of units you want to buy. to determine this  you need to know how much money you want to invest. if you want to invest  1 000  and the units are trading for  100 each  you can purchase 10 units. at this point  click  buy   and you will own units of the etf.    futures contracts are the main way commodities are directly traded  and this is a highly risky and sophisticated means of owning commodities. therefore  this is only recommended for advanced investors and traders.a futures contract refers to an agreement to to make or take delivery of a predetermined amount of a defined commodity at a specific point in the future for an agreed upon price. contracts are generally in standardized units. for example  a standard contract for brent crude oil is for 1000 barrels. there are also  mini  contracts available for 500 barrels.for example  you may enter into a contract to to purchase a 1000 barrels of oil at  40 per barrel on december 1st  2015. this contract would then be worth  40 000  1000 times 40 . if the price of oil rises to  45 per barrel before december  your contract is now more valuable because it allows you to purchase the product at  40 a barrel. you could then sell the more valuable contract before the due day to earn a profit. in this case  you would sell it for  45 000   45 per barrel times 1000 barrels   making a  5 000 profit.    futures contracts are very risky  which is why amateur traders should not use them without extensive research.   futures involve something called buying on margin. this means you only pay a small portion of the value of the contract  with the rest being borrowed. in the previous example  you would only pay 25  of the  40 000 value of the oil contract for example. this means if you sold it for  45 000 like in the example  you would make a 50  profit  because you would make  5 000 on an  10 000 investment . this also means you can quickly lose 50   or much more  if the price moves against you. if the price dropped  5 per barrel  you would lose half of your investment. your original equity was  10 000 and you borrowed  30 000 to buy the initial contract at  40 per barrel. if you sell the contract at  35 per barrel  the proceeds would be  35 000. after paying off the loan of  30 000 plus interest  your equity would be worth less than  5 000. keep in mind that in some cases you may be required to put up more than 25  for investments bought on margin. this depends on your broker and the investments made.futures also have very high commissions  relative to required investment for contract  not total value of contract   and require advanced strategies and knowledge to trade well.    if you have the knowledge  you can use futures to trade a commodity you are interested in. to do this  you will need to find a broker that offers futures trading.   many brokers that offer etfs and mutual funds often offer futures trading. popular brokers include td ameritrade  e trade  and tradestation. when you are ready  purchasing a futures contract involves a few simple steps. you will need to select the type of commodity you wish to purchase  and then you will need to select the month in which the contract expires  as well as the number of contracts you wish to purchase. for example  you may want to purchase 3 december 2015 crude oil contracts at the available price of  38 per barrel. most brokers have drop down menu s with the various dates  contract amounts  and commodities available. you simply need to select the options you want  and then click buy.    futures options are another type of investment that adds another level of complexity to futures contracts. whereas futures allows an investor to simply buy or sell a contract to make or take delivery of a commodity  options trading gives an investor an option to buy or sell a specific futures contract to make or take delivery of a identified commodity at a set price in the future. these options allow traders to respond to market changes.specifically  a call option gives an investor the right  but not the obligation  to buy a futures contract  called the strike price. a put option gives them the right  but not the obligation  to sell a future contract.the price paid for the option is the strike price and is independent of the futures contract price. if this seems confusing  that s because it is. many financial professional advise that individual investors  especially inexperienced ones  stay away from options investing entirely.  futures options are primarily used for two purposes  speculation and hedging. both come with unique sets of benefits and potential risks.   speculation with futures options is essentially the same as speculating on any other security  with one big difference. with a normal speculative investment  you are simply betting that the price of a security will rise. with a futures option  you are projecting that the price of a commodity will rise or fall in excess of the option strike price within a specific time period. this makes this type of speculation incredibly difficult. unlike other investments  options have a limited life and most expire without being exercised. investors do not own anything but a right to buy or sell for a limited period of time. hedging  the other use for futures options  is considerably less risky. essentially  hedging through futures options is an insurance policy for your current investments. you could  for example  purchase a put option such that you could sell off your investment and minimize your losses in the event of an unexpected drop in that asset s price.    if you ve decided to purchase futures options  you can likely do so with your current broker. many online brokerages offer futures options trading. be sure to check with your broker to be sure that you stay in line with any specific requirements for options trading.   even though put options require that you sell a commodity contract  you don t necessarily have to own this contract to buy the option.most options   calls or puts   are not exercised by the original purchaser who simply sells the option on or before its expiration date to close out the position with a profit or loss.

query	104	sell ford motor company break a car lease  a lease transfer allows you to find someone else who wants the car and is willing and able to make the monthly lease payments.   if you re able to transfer your lease  you can get out of the monthly payments without paying early termination costs. you ll still pay a few hundred dollars to transfer the lease. about 80 percent of leases have no post transfer obligations  but the other 20 percent require that you assume responsibility for the successful payment and maintenance of the vehicle. although the general trend in leasing favors open transfer policies  some lease agents and car companies such as bmw and infiniti retain post transfer obligations. if your lease includes post transfer obligations  you re still on the hook for payments even after the transfer. this means if the person who took over your lease doesn t make the payments  the lease company will come after you.some car companies also limit the time frame when you can transfer your lease. for example  nissan won t allow you to transfer your lease if you have fewer than seven payments remaining.your lease company may require you to pay a fee for the transfer and processing of the application  although you could pass these fees on to your buyer. for example  ford motor credit company charges a  75 credit application fee.never transfer a lease without the lease company s approval. doing so will result in significant fines.    companies such as carleasedepot.com  swapalease.com  and leasetrader.com specialize in lease transfers and handle the transfer process by working directly with your lease company.compare the fees and services of several lease transfer companies  and read customer reviews. make sure you ve read and understand the detail for all fees and procedures before you pick one to use. while each company does the same thing  fees for various aspects of the process may differ  or you may find you prefer one company s handling methods to another.    once you pay the advertising fees  the lease transfer company will post your advertisement on its online marketplace.   research reasons people take over car leases. taking over a lease has many benefits  including the ability to commit for a shorter period of time and avoid hefty down payments. if you find reasons that seem to fit your car  you can target your advertisement toward those people for better responses. for example  some people like to swap cars frequently and try new things  so if your leased car is a particularly trendy or sporty car  you might want to tailor your ad to attract that kind of buyer. interested parties will respond to you via email or through your account on the lease transfer company s website.    provide details and documentation relating to the vehicle s condition  maintenance  and accident history as soon as possible.   usually  the new lessee pays for any necessary vehicle inspections and transportation  as well as any transfer fees charged by the lease company. depending on your situation  you might want to add an incentive for the person who will take over your lease. a typical incentive is a stipend that reduces the monthly payments for the lease buyer  and can range from  500 to  5 000. when transferring a lease to someone who lives in another state  the lease transfer company can help arrange vehicle inspections or transportation of the vehicle.    either the lease transfer company or your original leasing company will do a credit check to see if the interested party is eligible to assume the lease.there may be a fee for this.once the buyer is approved  you ll pay a processing fee to the lease transfer company and provide the lease information to the transfer company. the lease transfer process usually takes several weeks to complete. once the transfer is in order  you ll sign the documents from the original lease company and the transfer company and turn over the car.    most leases include a  payoff  or  buyout  price. paying this amount will release you from your lease and pass ownership of the car to you.the price of the buyout is normally more than the car is actually worth  and the difference can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars. consult the kelley blue book to find out your car s value before choosing the buyout option.    if you can cut a deal with a buyer who has the cash on hand  you can reduce your overall loss by selling the car immediately after you buy out the lease. post your car for sale online at sites such as cars.com or autotrader.com. alternatively  you can sell your car the old fashioned way. put a sign in the window and leave it parked in a place with a lot of traffic. look for an individual buyer rather than a dealership. car dealers will offer the wholesale price because they need to make money on the car too   that typically won t be enough to get you out of your lease. a private individual wants to drive the car himself and may be willing to pay more. be honest with potential buyers. tell them as soon as possible why you are selling the car   especially if you require payment up front. if you need to get the money from the buyer before completing the lease buyout  the buyer may feel more comfortable paying the money directly to your lease company rather than paying you first and having you finish the transaction.    depending on the sales tax laws in your state  you may have to pay taxes when you sell your car. there may be other fees to take into account  such as title transfer fees or registration fees.  become familiar with the terms of the early termination clause of your lease agreement before you contact the leasing company. keep in mind these clauses are usually designed to protect the finance company  not benefit you.  find out exactly how much early termination will cost you  and what additional fees are involved. many companies charge a substantial early termination fee that is roughly equivalent to making all remaining lease payments at once. in addition  they ll tack on predetermined penalty fees or other fees for  restocking  or  processing.     if your only reason for needing out of the lease is a financial one  your lease company may have relief programs for people with verifiable financial strain.   if you ve lost a job or experienced a death in the family  it might be possible to get a forbearance on your payments. you ll be expected to make up the difference at a later date  but it might help you in the meantime. some companies will let you  trade in  your lease. for example  if you were leasing a more expensive car and want to save money  you could trade in your luxury sedan on a cheaper economy car.trade ins often come with additional fees  and a trade in typically is still considered an early termination of the lease for credit reporting purposes.    some leasing companies will assess additional fees for body damage or general disrepair.

query	107	support liberal party of canada teach children liberal values  it is important that your children understand that they are in control of their bodies  and they don t have to hug  kiss  touch  or be touched if they don t want to.liberals believe that people should have control over what happens to their bodies  whether they are a man or a woman  or whether they are young or old.   don t tell your children who they have to show affection to. for example  don t say   kiss grandma before she goes home   instead  let them decide how the feel comfortable saying goodbye to grandma. conversely  it is also important to teach your children that they need to ask permission before touching anyone else. encourage them to ask grandma if they can give her a kiss if they have said that they would like to do so.    don t reinforce the gender stereotyping that leads boys to believe that they shouldn t show emotions  and girls to believe that they have to be dainty and wear dresses all of the time. instead  let them find out who they are and what they like without injecting your own biases into the situation.for example  let your daughters engage in physical activity  and let them do it the same way that boys do. don t discourage them from climbing on the monkey bars because you re worried they re too fragile. conversely  don t discourage a boy from liking something because it s pink  and don t say things like   big boys don t cry  when he feels sad about something.    being empathetic to the experiences of others plays a big role in liberal ideology. your child will need to develop their own skills of empathy  and research suggests that parents can play a big role in helping develop this skill.for example  research suggests that children who feel secure and loved are more likely to be empathetic. spend time talking with your child about different emotions and about how emotions can affect our behavior. it doesn t matter how young your child is  talking to them about their own feelings as well as your own will help them understand that everyone has different experiences. set a good example for your children. being empathetic yourself is a great way to teach children about empathy. if you and your child witness someone who is going through a hard time  e.g. a homeless person on the street  talk with your child  and ask them how they think that person must be feeling. expose them to different types of people. try to let your children see that people are quite different if you venture outside your hometown. expose your children to the different cultures and experiences that the world has to offer. for example  you could take them on a trip to a foreign country. while you are visiting that country  ask them to identify what is different about the people in this country. however  also ask them to notice how they have similarities with those people.    one of the core values of liberalism is tolerance.it is important to teach kids that being tolerant doesn t mean sacrificing their own beliefs. it means that children should learn that it is good to be open to learning about the differences of others.this doesn t only refer to political values either. it also refers to cultural differences  religious differences  and all the other kinds of ways in which people can be different.    many liberals believe that it is important that the government fund programs that help people in need. this could involve a range of different programs  for example  if you are fired from your job you are able to get unemployment benefits that will help you take care of your family while you search for a new job.you can demonstrate why this is important by pointing out ways that you or someone you know has been helped through a tough situation by a social support program. for example  you can use an example like this   last year  aunt sarah was fired from her job and she was very worried for awhile about how she could take care of her family without a paycheck. however  she was able to get money from the government to help feed her family while she looked for a new job.  you can also demonstrate the value of social support programs by asking them what they think should be done in a particular situation. for example  if you see a homeless person asking for money on the street  ask your children how they would help that person. liken their response to something the government can also do.     liberal people tend to be against war as a means for solving problems. war results in unnecessary loss of life  pain and suffering  and money being spent on the military that could have been spent on other things  such as education.one good way to talk about this topic with your kids is to ask them about how they have been taught to solve problems with friends at school. hopefully  you have demonstrated that you never ever use violence to try and solve a problem. point out how many governments think that it s ok to use violence to solve a problem  but in the end it leaves a lot of families feeling sad because they have lost someone they care about.    liberals are generally in favor of immigration laws that make it possible for people to immigrate legally to the united states. additionally  liberals are typically in favor of extending help to undocumented immigrants who wish to stay in the united states.you can talk with your children about immigration by talking about your own family history. unless you are a native american  your family immigrated to the us from somewhere else  even if it was 200 years ago. point out to your children how many families would like to come to the us to have good lives just like they have.    perhaps one of the biggest debates in politics these days is the pro choice pro life debate. typically  people with liberal values tend to support the pro choice side of the argument. this is the notion that a woman has the right to choose what she does with her body  and if she wants to have an abortion  then that is her decision.similarly  be in favor of offering women several methods of birth control. just because you are pro choice doesn t necessarily mean you think people should get abortions all the time. it does mean though that you support giving women  and men  lots of different ways to prevent unwanted pregnancy. this may be a difficult topic to discuss with your child directly  but you can still demonstrate that every one should have the right to choose what to do with their body  regardless of their gender. for example  you can talk with your child about how they have been taught that they don t have to touch or kiss anyone they don t want to kiss. point out to them that everyone has this right  no matter their gender.    another hot debate in the united states in recent years is gay marriage. liberals tend to support marriage for all people  whether they are hetero  or homosexual. the belief is that love is love  and americans should have the right to choose who they marry  as long as it is with another consenting adult.talk with your kids about sexuality. you can explain to them that just because they are a girl doesn t mean they have to  like  boys  and vice versa. explain how there are many boys who like boys  and girls who like girls  some who like both boys and girls. ask your children what they think about gay marriage  and why they think what they do. ask them if they think that a person should be allowed to marry the person they love regardless of their gender  as long as the other person also wants to get married. showing your child that you are open to conversations and questions on any topic will make them more open to discussing topics that they find difficult.    there are likely many values that you want to instill in your child. think about which values are the most important to you. it is important to realize that you only have so much influence on your children  so focus on the ones that mean the most to you.for example  you may feel very strongly about raising children who are tolerant and open minded  but you may not care too much about what religion they follow  if the follow any religion at all. you can talk with your children about religion  but don t make it the most important thing. instead  focus on setting examples of tolerance. talk about what can happen when people are narrow minded and intolerant. in one study  liberal parents reported that teaching tolerance was the most important thing in their mind.if you have a partner that you are raising your child with  be sure to spend time talking with them about what values you want to instill. this could be challenging if you and your partner have different political views  but try to find a middle ground  or at least a few areas you can agree on.    there is research that suggests that if you constantly push your beliefs onto your children  there will be a tendency for them to rebel against those beliefs.if you consider yourself liberal  and want to raise liberal children  then don t force them to accept it as though it is the only right way to live.   this doesn t mean you can t talk to them about your political beliefs and why you believe them. instead  it means that you should avoid being dogmatic about your beliefs  and try to avoid saying negative things about conservatives in front of your children. explain both sides of the story  and talk about why you feel liberal values are best for you. ask them their opinions about things without first telling them what you think. learn about who they are and how they feel.    your child may come to you with lots of difficult questions about why you believe what you believe  and they may even ask questions that challenge your beliefs. do your best to avoid losing your patience and getting angry.for example  your child may come home from a sleepover and tell you that jimmy s dad was talking to jimmy s mom  and said that anyone who believes gay marriage is acceptable is an idiot. your child may ask you why that is. in a situation like this  you may feel very angry that jimmy s dad was saying these things in front of your child  but avoid getting angry. instead of getting angry  say something like   well  jimmy s dad might think that is true  and he is entitled to have that belief. however  gay people are just the same as everybody else. they are also entitled to love who they love and marry the person who wants to marry them. do you think that people should be able to marry the person they love  or that they shouldn t be allowed to because someone else doesn t like it   framing your response as a conversation where you explain your own beliefs as logically as possible helps your child to make the idea their own  and decide what makes sense to them.    both sides of the political spectrum have their faults  and being liberal doesn t make you or anyone else perfect. when you child asks you a question  try to give them an honest answer. try to talk about both sides of the issue and why you have chosen to believe what you do.for example  many people start out somewhere on the political spectrum and then move to the other side for some reason. talk to your children about your early views and why you eventually became a more liberal person. give examples of events that led you to believe in more liberal values. keep in mind that when it comes to values there is not usually an objectively correct answer. there is only a belief in a morally correct answer. keeping this in mind will help you avoid being dogmatic.    if you are a very political person  you might have strong opinions about those that have differing views. you may think conservatives are nothing more than racist bigots. however  one important value of liberals is tolerance. thus  you should set an example for children. be tolerant of those who don t agree with you.you can explain to children why you don t agree with conservative values  but do so respectfully without using hateful or derogatory language.    the best way to help instill liberal values is to set a good example for your children by living in accordance with those values. whenever possible  set a good example of what you think it means to be a good liberal person.for example  be tolerant of people who are different than you. don t talk badly about someone just because they are somehow different. try volunteering for a political movement that you support  and bring your kids along. try to opt for peaceful movements where your child will be able to see liberal people at their best. try to avoid movements that are violent as this may frighten your child.    for most children  politics is a confusing subject. take time to explain why it is important to have an opinion about politics.for example  take time to explain to them the main two parties in the us  democratic and republican  as well as some of the other parties  e.g. green party  tea party  libertarians  etc. . talk about the values of each party  and give some examples of different presidents from each party. explain how in the us  everyone over the age of 18 is entitled to vote in elections that will help decide who will run the country. explain how elected leaders are supposed to represent the will of the people that elected them.    have your children spend time with friends and family who have similar values. hearing about why other people have similar beliefs may help them decide on their own beliefs.   this doesn t mean that you should keep them away from people who have different values. as they mature and grow older  your child will have to learn to deal with  and be understanding of  the fact that people are different. since tolerance is a liberal value  showing them that there are people who don t think the same as them is also important. if they spend time with someone who has strong conservative values  address the matter with your child. for example  you can say   today you are going to spend time with grandpa. grandpa is a good and kind man  but sometimes he might say something that you don t think is right. try to remember that he has some different ideas about things  but that he loves you very much  and that you love him too. we don t have to agree on everything to be a close family.   
query	108	join little league baseball coach little league  the first step in becoming a little league coach is to volunteer for the job. there will probably be a formal application process and an interview  though each local league is different. the league s manager and other officers will consider you for the position if one is available.if you have substantial knowledge of baseball rules and strategies  or prior coaching experience  you are more likely to be considered for the position.    before the season starts  or early in the season  you should receive a contact sheet from the league with information about all the kids on your team. in some cases  you might need to provide parents with this sheet yourself. this sheet should have each player s full name  address  their parents  phone numbers and addresses  if the parents live apart from their child .this sheet  or a secondary sheet  should also include detailed medical information  such as allergies  blood type  and any other relevant medical information. some leagues might require you to collect additional information. consult your league handbook to ensure you have all the necessary information on your players.    as soon as you have phone numbers for all the players on your team  call their parents and introduce yourself. explain to the parents what the league s general rules are and what your expectations for the team are.during this call  you might also want to speak to the player briefly about how you re looking forward to seeing them on the field. there s no need for an extended conversation  however  since you ll have lots of time with the players during games and practice.    every little league is a bit different. obtain your league s handbook and read it several times so you can familiarize yourself with the league s rules  policies  and regulations.keep this rulebook handbook close during games and practice so you can reference it if necessary.    some little league coaches offer complicated and confusing directions. however  at its core  baseball is about catching  hitting  and throwing the ball. keep your directions and guidance simple by employing that terminology.for instance  instead of saying   i want to see a double when they get bases loaded   you might say   i want you to hit the ball  run to first base  and then run to second base.  using clear and straightforward directions  you can gradually teach more complex plays as your players master the simpler ones.    all your players are different. get to know each player on your team as an individual. this will allow you to identify when and how you should push your players to improve their performance.some players  for instance  might respond best to an aggressive delivery such as   come on  step it up   other players might respond best to a more gentle and comforting suggestion like   you re doing great  but i want you to work a little harder out there.     nothing is worse for the kids than a coach who yells after every error. if you see a player doing something wrong consistently  pull them aside and explain what they are doing wrong. if necessary  work with them to adjust their technique.  let all the parents know when the games are  when they need to bring snacks to practice  when they need to pay equipment fees  and any other information that they might need to know. use a variety of methods to keep parents in the loop.if you have specific concerns for a single parent  it s best to call or meet them face to face. if you have general information you want to share with all the parents  you can email them or send a handbill home with the kids on your team. for quick messages   see you at tonight s game at barton field    you could send a text message. don t expect your players to communicate information directly to their parents.    disciplinary issues are likely addressed in your league handbook. consult this guidebook in the event you need to discipline your players. hold all your players to the same disciplinary standard and  when necessary  apply disciplinary actions equally. in most cases  a verbal warning is enough to correct a player s foul attitude or misbehavior.let your players know at the outset of the season that they should demonstrate a positive attitude. inform them of the consequences of poor discipline. during practice  warn any troublemakers that they will be running laps or performing pushups if they continue to cause problems. during games  warn any troublemakers that they will be removed from play if they continue to cause problems.    if you demonstrate confidence in your skills and abilities  your team will feel confident  too. the best way to coach little league with confidence is to gain experience coaching little league or another sport.if you don t have coaching experience  you can build confidence by reflecting on your prior successes in business  academia  or another field in which you excel. carefully study your team s ability level and identify how you can improve it. keep an eye on each player s batting technique  pitching ability  and hand eye coordination. use your knowledge of each player to maximize the team s strength. for instance  do not put your player with the strongest arm as an outfielder. play them as a pitcher instead.    do not scream and shout at umpires or disrespect the opposing team  even if the game has already ended. this will only encourage the kids in your league to do likewise.  as coach  your players will be looking to you to demonstrate good sportsmanship. take the lead in shaking hands with the opposing coach when the game is concluded and insist that your players line up to shake hands with their opponents after the game   no matter the outcome.remind your team that winning isn t everything. whether your team wins or loses  the most important thing should be to have fun.    some little league coaches give weaker players less time on the field or less attention than the more skilled players. however  in the interests of fairness  you should give everyone on your team equal attention and allow everyone to play.some leagues might have rules regarding how long or how often each player can be on the field. consult your league s guidebook for more information. do not bench players just because they are not playing well.    as the old saying goes  practice makes perfect. schedule practice at a regular time at least twice each week. practice provides your team with the opportunity to not only practice their skills but to bond and build trust with each other.practice should not last more than two hours. with regular practice  you will be able to see your team improve immensely.    by planning out exactly what you want your team to work on during practice sessions  you won t have to think up something for them to work on when they show up. doing so could make your team and their parents think you re disorganized and lacking in capability.select only a few skills to work on in each practice session. focus primarily on fundamentals like hitting  catching  base running  and throwing. reserve some time for advanced skills like run downs  situational defense  and so on. spend the last 30 minutes doing something that your team wants to work on like errors  run  and hits.    if you focus on any one activity for more than 20 30 minutes  you will lose the attention of many kids. you can forestall this somewhat by encouraging your players to focus by saying things like   keep your head in the game   but over too long a period  even the most attentive player will tire of the same exercise. move your practice sessions along to prevent the players from getting bored.  scrimmages are short practice games. depending how many players you have on your team  you should be able to divide your team into two roughly equal squads  six on six  for instance . designate one team the  at bat  team and the other the  on field  team. after the on field team scores three outs  let the players switch sides. this will allow your team to practice under more game like conditions.  additional or assistant coaches are crucial to coaching little league successfully. another coach will be able to bring a second set of eyes to your team  identify strengths and weaknesses that you might not  and prevent the kids from getting into trouble. your league might assign a second or third coach to your team  or you might wish to request one from the league manager.with the help of assistant coaches  you can run several practice sessions at once. for instance  while you work on outfield drills  you might have another coach working on pitching and catching  and another coach working on infield drills.    meet with your league s safety officer. the safety officer will recommend what sort of equipment you re required to have on hand. you should always have a first aid kit equipped with ice packs  band aids  and so on. you should also have your payers  medical information sheets available in case they become necessary.before each game or practice  walk the field  looking for safety liabilities. for instance  if you see broken bottles  glass  or sharp objects on the field  remove them to prevent injury. do not allow games to continue in excessively inclement weather.    at the start of each season  consult with your league s equipment manager. your players will probably bring their own gloves and bats. they might also provide their own shin guards  mouth guards  and other safety equipment. the league will probably provide batting helmets and baseballs.additionally  consult with parents directly or via email to help them choose the right sort of cleats for their children  if necessary.

query	110	announce retirement major league baseball become a baseball scout  first  refresh your knowledge on the game of baseball if necessary. you need to have a strong understanding of the strategies and mechanics of the game. it is valuable for an associate scout to know as much as possible about playing the game of baseball so he can relate to prospects.baseball is in some ways a very technical sport  which means that baseball scouts need to have a keen eye and meticulous attention to detail. when you watch a game  practice the kind of behavior scouts do by paying attention to things like batting averages  running speeds  and pitching techniques. if you find it helpful  read up  both with books and online  on the strategies and mechanics of baseball  as well as the statistics and attributes that go into determining what separates a good player from a great player.    although there are plenty of scouts who have little experience actually playing the game  it can certainly help. playing baseball gives you the kind of first hand experience with how the game is played and what makes a good player that you can t get from just watching. any experience with the game from the player s perspective is going to give you a leg up when it comes to analyzing them from the other side.you don t need years of semi professional experience or a college baseball career. look for a recreational baseball group in your city  or put one together yourself.    there exist courses that anyone can take that teach the foundations of how to be a scout. they are training programs designed specifically for a aspiring scouts. search online to find scout courses near you.mlb has its own official scout school  but be aware that they only hold programs in a few states  and positions are limited.    scouting baseball isn t a particularly glamorous job. it involves constant traveling  long periods away from home  waking up early  and an exhausting amount of work. scouts have a lot of information in their heads when they re out on the job  everything from the names of coaches and players in their area to batting averages and pitching speeds. as a scout  you ll see endless hotel rooms  high school and college games  plane flights and rental cars. your tools are nothing more than a radar gun  a notepad  and a wealth of knowledge about the minute details of what makes a baseball player great.  the most significant difference between scouting high school players and scouting college players is that with high school players  a scout needs to be able to project their skills farther into the future. college players will have already enhanced their speed  strength  and skill  thanks to both more experience and better  more specialized coaches. that being said  high school scouting is the more important of the two  because the players you ll be watching in college will be the ones you identified as worth watching in high school.  many high up executives in the mlb were once scouts  and many started out as unpaid interns before that. unpaid internships usually require little to no experience  which makes them an ideal first step into an organization like the mlb.you can search for internships online  or by simply going into the offices of nearby teams and asking if they re looking to fill any positions.    find a baseball scout at local baseball games. they usually hold a radar gun  which is used to measure how fast a baseball is thrown  and carry items like clipboards or binders with the logo of their professional baseball team employer on them. approach them and discuss your aspirations.   get into the habit of going to local games in leagues that scouts will be looking at  like amateur leagues  semi professional leagues  and college baseball. avoid coming on to strong. when you try to make a connection with a baseball scout  be aware that everyone is different  and some people are not going to open to helping out an aspiring scout. you ll need to be outgoing and friendly  and know when to cut your loses.    as associate scout is an unpaid position that reports to a baseball scout. the associate scout is responsible for providing the scout with information on a regular basis regarding baseball players in a designated geographic area. associate scouts typically work in the areas in which they live.mlb its own career opportunities search engine on their official website. check this regularly to see if any associate scout positions near you pop up. another option is to get to know scouts in your area  either by going to games and striking up conversations with them  or by making connections and networking from your internship with an organization. if you make your desire to become an associate scout clear  and you re a hard worker  you ll be noticed eventually.    as an associate scout  you will need to recognize players who have the skills required for professional baseball. pay attention to advice from your supervising scout and read books on player evaluation. your player evaluation skills are going to improve mostly through pure practice. by seeing batter after batter  pitcher after pitcher  and catcher after catcher  you ll slowly get better at noticing minute differences between their techniques  skills  and results.a scout has to know not just how to evaluate a player s current skills  but more importantly  how to see potential in player and project where their skills will end up. to do so  scouts judge position players in five basic areas  known as the five tools. a player who is great in all five tools is considered a five tool player  and is a scout s dream.those tools are   hitting average  which refers to how consistently a player can hit the ball and hit it accurately. hitting power  which refers to how high and far a player can hit the ball. fielding  which refers to a player s effectiveness on the field  his agility  footwork  and quick reaction time. arm strength  which refers to a player s strength when throwing a ball. speed  which refers to a player s running speed.   when scouting pitchers  scouts always sit behind the home plate  so they can get a good view of the plate from the batter and pitcher s perspective. they look for velocity first and command of the ball second  because usually  command can be improved through training much further than velocity can.    associate scouts need to report how players are progressing and describe the skills of new prospects in a timely fashion. you ll need to know the rating system for players inside and out. scouts give two numbers for each category in their reports  one for their current rating  and one for their prospective future rating. some of the categories scouts report on include hitting power  pitching velocity  fielding ability  and running speed.scouts use a 20 80 scale to rate players on the five tools. fifty and above is major league status. scouts generally look for players who are above major league status in at least two of the five tools.for pitchers  scouts rate the player s velocity with each of their pitches  with their fastball being the most important. that s because fastball skill is much more innate  whereas one can improve one s skill with a curveball or changeup. in addition  scout s measure a player s command of the ball  and their control. command is their ability to put the ball where the catcher wants it. control is their ability to consistently hit the strike zone.    show your supervising scout and the organization he works for that you ve got what it takes to be a professional scout. being good at making decisions  talking to people  digging up information  and being organized and aggressive could open up a paid position as an area scout.understand that it could take a number of years to be promoted to an area scout because the positions open sporadically. in this position  you are responsible for reviewing all amateur baseball players in a geographical region  such as oklahoma and kansas or northern florida and georgia.    once you officially become a scout  there is room for advancement. if you continue to refine your ability to pick bright  young baseball stars  your next promotion could be to area supervisor and eventually national cross checker. keys to success include your ability as a scout  your passion for the job  how well you make connections within the industry  and your ambition for advancement.
query	111	perform ballad maroon 5 read poetry  poetry is not merely fancy words that rhyme. think on how you might say a sentence in many different ways  depending on what you want to imply to the person you are speaking to.   for example  you might say  come here   to a friend. if you were going to write this as in a novel  you might write     come here   i demanded.  or you might say     come here   i said insidiously.  you could also say     come here   by themselves  the two words have dramatically different connotations than when put together. the same applies to poetry.    a poet will work within established rhyme and meter to use words in surprising and unexpected ways... ways that will bring enjoyment to you  the reader.    the pause you take for breath comes at the punctuation  regardless of where it occurs in the line. take  for example  the first paragraph of the poem  the death of cenone  by alfred  lord tennyson    there lies a vale in ida  lovelier  than all the valleys of ionian hills.  the swimming vapour slopes athwart the glen   puts forth an arm  and creeps from pine to pine   and loiters  slowly drawn. on either hand  the lawns and meadow hedges midway down  hang rich in flowers  and far below them roars  the long brook fallen thro  the clov n ravine  in cataract after cataract to the sea.  behind the valley topmost gargarus  stands up and takes the morning  but in front  the gorges  opening wide apart  reveal  troas and ilion s column d citadel   the crown of troas.    notice that sometimes a line ends with a comma  and sometimes it doesn t. if you read it like this   there lies a vale in ida  lovelier  pause  pause  than all the valleys of ionian hills.  pause  pause   . you might be a little puzzled as to why the poet would write a poem that doesn t flow. the reason is because you are reading it  sing song  like. try reading it again without the formatting.    there lies a vale in ida  lovelier than all the valleys of ionian hills.  you should notice this time that the emphasis has been placed on  ida  rather than on the pauses and  ionian  from the former reading. it sounds like a conversation. now try it again   there lies a vale in ida  lovelier than all the valleys of ionian hills.     notice that the emphasis was still placed on  ida   but the word  lovelier  and  all  had a stronger feeling to it  it was said with a greater accent  giving it an arrested and smitten sound. this poem was written rather like a paragraph in a story  or a monologue in a play. notice how different it sounds when read like a story and not a ballad     note  this takes practice  you might have to read it aloud several times before getting it right. when you are finished  did you see that you were actually able to follow along with the story being relayed  oftentimes when reading a poem like a ballad  with breaks at the end of each line  you can get caught up in maintaining the rhythm  and find it difficult to concentrate on the actual poem.    this should be obvious  but oftentimes you can simply skip over a word  and chalk up its meaning to  context clues  or  implied meaning  like they taught in 2nd grade. look up the words you don t know  and even the words you think you know but are maybe a little unsure on. you may be surprised as to how the poem changes colors in your head.

animals products could be used in the food. in addition to reducing animal cruelty  eating at home is also better for your health as your food is generally lower in calories and less stocked with hidden sugars and fats.    there are a litany of organizations available you can join or donate to that are dedicated to reducing cruelty towards animals worldwide. do some research and find which organization appeals to your views.   the humane society of america is one of the world s largest animal advocacy organizations. they target puppy mills  animal fighting  factory farming  seal slaughter  horse cruelty  and the slaughterhouse trade. the organization works through both large scale political initiatives and hands on efforts to rescue and care for unwanted animals.the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals  aspca  is another one of the better known animal advocacy organizations. much like the humane society of america  they oppose most forms of cruelty

animals. in 2013  allegations surfaced that peta had euthanized many of the rescued animals at their virginia headquarters.you can also find a local animal shelter in your area and volunteer there.    if no existing organization appeals to you personally  you can always start a neighborhood watch in your area. invite your friends and neighbors to get to know the animals in your area and keep an eye out for suspicious behavior.   be aware of the animals in your area. by being vigilant  and encouraging others to do the same  you ll be likely to notice potential problems  such as a formerly friendly dog suddenly becoming aggressive or skittish around people.there are many signs of animal abuse. physical signs include collars that are too tight  open wounds or signs of recently healed wounds  fur infested with fleas or ticks  patches of missing skin or rashes  and extreme thinness. pay attention to the animal s environment. are they tied up alone frequently  are they kept outside despite poor weather conditions  like intense heat or cold  is an animal kept in a small kennel  or one crowded with many other animals  for extended periods  encourage all members of your watch to stay vigilant  and if you notice any of the above signs of cruelty report it to your group and decide as a group how to proceed.    animal cruelty is a crime  and if you see abuse happening do not hesitate to report it to the proper authorities.   where to report cruelty depends on your state. contacting the local humane society is a good first step  as the workers there usually know what law agency to contact. you can also visit a local police station and ask for help.when you know who to contact  provide concise written statements that includes the dates of the incident or incidents  and any other witnesses besides yourself. if possible  get photographic evidence of the abuse.  one of the most important things you can do to endorse animal welfare is being a model for friends  family members  and co workers.   share your views. do not be shy about explaining your opinions on animal cruelty and welfare. many people are not informed about the conditions of slaughterhouses  animal testing facilities  and puppy mills. if animals come up in conversation  take this as an opportunity to keep others informed. use social media to your advantage. post lists of animal based ingredients hidden in many products  links to petitions to end animal testing  and local listings from your animal shelter of dogs at risk for euthanasia. if you have kids  talk to them about treating animals with kindness and respect. young children often do not differentiate between a living dog and a plush dog. explain to them animals have feelings and thoughts similar to our own  and need to be treated with compassion and care.    whether you live in a small town or a major metropolitan area  there is probably an animal shelter near you. directories of animal shelters are available online. find a shelter close to you  whose values you agree with  and look into volunteering.   most shelters have some form of training or certification program you must undergo before beginning to volunteer. make sure you know what you need to do before you can start  and work time for training into your schedule. not all shelters share the same values. for example  some shelters are no kill while some euthanize animals if they re not adopted within specific time frames. make sure you agree with the values of the shelter you choose. a lot of shelters have restrictions  often regarding age  for volunteers. look into such restrictions when looking for volunteer programs.    when you give money to a local shelter  the money goes to getting animals veterinary care  toys  blankets  beds  food  treats  and a variety of new supplies.   you do not necessarily have to donate to a shelter in your area. if  for example  your local shelter does not have a no kill policy and you disagree with this  you can send your money elsewhere. many shelters take donations online. a monetary donation is not the only way to give back to a shelter. you can donate any amount of pet supplies. just ask about any restrictions beforehand. some shelters have bans on particular brands of food  litter  and toys. if you re getting married or throwing a big party  you can donate part of your gift registry. you can request that guests donate to a particular shelter rather than buying you a present.  if you re unable adopt an animal of your own  many shelters have programs where you can foster an animal until they find a permanent home.   there are a variety of reasons animal shelters seek fosters. the shelter is sometimes not big enough to house all the animals. an animal may be recovering from surgery or sickness and cannot be around other animals. some animals do not do well in shelters and show signs of stress and need extra socialization.many people worry about getting attached to their foster pet. this is a risk. most shelters allow foster homes to adopt their pets if they meet all the requirements. however  if you cannot adopt your foster pet the experience is still rewarding. fostering frees up space for other animals and allows the shelter to learn more about the foster pet s personality  upping that pet s chances at finding a permanent home. reminding yourself of these benefits can help with some of the emotional difficulty.  if you have the time and space  consider adopting a pet from the shelter. this is a direct way to improve the life of animal that s suffering.   adopting can save a life  as 2.7 million shelter pets are euthanized each year. because of limited space  pets are sometimes euthanized if they cannot find homes.adoption takes business away from puppy mills. puppy mills are factory style breeding facilities where house dogs in poor conditions  keeping them in very small cages and breeding them over and over again. when dogs are no longer able to breed  they are often abandon or killed.

office pool participants is that the person with the least knowledge of the sport always wins the march madness pool. while it can happen  and is extremely frustrating  there s really no advantage in

proven track records and who can t win away from their own arena. this knowledge will come in handy.    take seeding  or a team s rank  into account  but don t be a slave to it  there are often upsets  most notably in the number five to number 12 match ups in the first round. use your bracket s point system to maximize your gains  as some award more points based on the winning team s initial seeding.   know the trends. entering the 2008 tournament  no. 1 seeds are 92 0 against 16s. even if you think that a no. 16 will win this year  the odds say that you re probably wrong. it s not that you re not brave  it s that it s just not worth taking that sort of risk. in fact  don t risk taking any team above the 12 seed in the first round unless you re absolutely sure it s a mismatch. if you pick a 13  14  15  or 16 seed to win in the first round  you re picking against a team that  based on seeds  should be going to the sweet 16 as long as they take care of business. however  also realize that 12 v. 5 and 11 v. 6 games are upset city. usually at least one of each will win  so be on the lookout for which ones you think can make it past the first round. know that 10 v. 7 games

indicate the ability to create opportunities and adjust to opponents  defensive weaknesses  as well as the capacity to work well as a team.    focus on teams that can play both a zone and a man to man defense  and therefore adapt easily to the variety of teams they might face during the tournament.   look at teams who can execute a full court press. full court press is a little more popular in college basketball than it is in the pros  but it can translates to a couple more steals and fast break points per game.    try to find out the picks other people in your pool are making and deviate

query	119	get insurance tiscali buy auto insurance  every state has a list of minimum requirements for liability auto insurance. you need to make sure that when you get an estimate that includes the right minimum coverage to stay in line with state laws. this liability is the maximum amount of money the insurance company is legally obligated to pay if you are at fault in an accident. most insurance companies should know the state laws  and provide the minimum  but it is always good to know the limits before you start shopping.state liability limits will cover three kinds of limits. these are bodily injury for one person in an accident  injury for all people injured in an accident  and property damage for one accident. in illinois  for example  the three limits are  20 000   40 000  and  15 000. these are usually explained in shorthand by the thousands  so you would see this listed as 20 40 15. you can certainly purchase more  but you need at least that much. in addition  some states require you to include uninsured underinsured motorist coverage with your policy in case the person at fault in an accident does not have insurance  or it can t cover the cost. this coverage is required in connecticut  dc  illinois  kansas  maine  maryland  massachusetts  minnesota  missouri  new hampshire  new jersey  new york  north carolina  north dakota  oregon  south dakota  vermont  virginia  west virginia  and wisconsin.    if you are receiving a loan to purchase your car  the lender probably has coverage requirements as well. some may simply require that you have your state s minimum required coverage  but some lenders may want more coverage. most lenders require that replacement costs are covered with collision and comprehension insurance.  once you know the minimum that your state requires and if your auto lender has any requirements  you may consider increasing your coverage when you get quotes. when you think about your coverage  consider your driving habits and environment.a general recommendation for liability limits after meeting state minimums is 50 100 25. when considering your limits  make sure you buy enough to help cover your personal assets. the more money you have to your name  the more you can lose if you are at fault in an accident. liability coverage does not limit the amount that can be awarded in a law suit. consider a general liability policy in addition to auto insurance if this is a concern. things to look at in your driving habits include your past accident history  commute time and driving conditions  and where you park your car at night.    in addition to damage liabilities  you can also consider a variety of other coverage options. the most common are collision and comprehensive coverage. collision helps to pay for damages from an accident  while comprehensive pays for damages from another cause  such as vandalism  theft  or weather.other potential coverage options include rental reimbursement  which pays for a rental car while yours is in the shop  or roadside assistance to cover a towing. if you are a member of an auto club  like aaa   you may already have some of these items covered  so you won t need them from your insurance company. when considering supplemental coverage  you will also want to think about the value of your car. a car that is older and or low value may not be worth supplemental coverage  since insurance will only pay up to the estimated fair market value of your car  which may not be worth the price of additional coverage. if your car is newer and or high value  then these supplemental coverages may save you a significant amount of money if your car is damaged.  additional coverages come as deductibles   that is  agreeing how much you will pay out of pocket before the insurance kicks in. the higher your deductible  the lower your premium payments  meaning you will have to pay the insurance company less.make sure that if you go with a high deductible  you actually have the money to cover those costs.    much of your potential insurance premium will be based on your driving record  in addition to the model  age  and use of car being insured. insurance companies will want to know how much of a potential risk you are before offering coverage. your record should be available through your state s department of motor vehicles  which should be tracking any legal issues that have come up due to your driving.if you notice any errors on your driving record  be sure to contest them. you don t want these causing you to pay more for insurance.if you know that recent traffic violations  like speeding tickets  are going to come off your record shortly  consider waiting to get quotes until after they are gone. losing those points will help get you lower payments.    before you start calling insurance companies for quotes  you will need some information handy. every company you call will ask for this information to get your quote  so having it with you will make this process go more quickly. information you ll need for a quote includes the number of drivers in your household  the age and sex of potential drivers  and their state driver s license numbers the make  model  year  and vehicle identification number  vin  for your car the type of coverage and limits you want the location where you park your car at night    one of the most important parts of getting auto insurance is to call several companies to shop around for quotes. every auto insurance company calculates your risk slightly differently  so you can get a variety of premiums to pay. this will help you compare prices and get the best deal for yourself. you can get insurance quotes from a variety of sources. many large companies will allow you to get a quote online  while in other cases you will need to call an agent directly. talk to friends and family as well to get a list of potential names to call.  every insurance company will be willing to offer discounts to drivers as a way to induce them to get their policy. when asking for quotes  ask what kind of discounts the company has available. many of them are related to your past behavior or things you have purchased for your car.the national association of insurance commissioners recommends that you ask specifically for discounts related to a good driving record  a good credit rating  good grades  for young drivers   driver s education courses  multiple automobile policies  safety equipment on the car  or for longtime policy holders. ask about the potential for bundling your auto insurance with renter s or home insurance. this can get you a lower rate on your auto insurance. your place of work  college  or professional group may have a side deal for additional insurance discounts. be sure to ask those groups as well to see if there are particular groups you should shop with.  once you have gotten several quotes  compare what you have. you don t necessarily need to take the lowest price  but at least you ll know what it is. remember that each company is also offering a variety of discounts and services. when you compare prices  think about the kinds of services each is offering.   when thinking about prices  consider the monthly premium. your insurance may have you pay a monthly payment with interest  or they may give you the option of paying in a lump sum twice a year. consider whether you have enough money to make two large lump payments and calculate how much your policy would really cost once you factor in any interest.be aware that checking multiple quotes beyond a single 30 day period may adversely affect your credit score.    once you have a company you want to go with  or at least have a couple in mind  be sure to check out their history. insurance agents have past records as well  and you may be sacrificing good customer service to pay a lower premium. you can check your agent s through the naic website to see if there are outstanding complaints.check your state s insurance board records as well. you can search for your insurance agent or broker or for the company itself.    once you have decided which policy and insurance company you want to go with  make sure you meet with an agent face to face. even large insurance companies will have local agents and offices  so there should be someone you can talk to directly.hopefully you won t deal with your agent much after signing the policy. that being said  it can be good to have some familiarity and comfort with the agent and his or her customer service style if you do need to file a claim.    once you have the policy in hand  and before you sign on the dotted line  read through the policy one more time. you ll want to make sure that what you have is what you intended  and that everything meets state requirements.when reviewing your policy  look at the details for certain types of repairs. when your policy talks about repairs  see if it uses terms like  new factory    like kind and quality   or  aftermarket parts.  this will prevent you from getting into disputes with your insurance company when things need to be replaced.  once you ve purchased insurance  that shouldn t be the end of your process. your coverage will come up for renewal every six to 12 months. when you start getting close to that time  start shopping around again to see if you can get a better rate or policy.remember that your driving record  and your insurance needs  will change all the time. checking with insurance providers regularly will help ensure that you are always getting the best plan for you and your circumstances.  
query	120	extend visa visa inc. get your b1 business visa extended  if you want to extend your stay in the united states  you need to plan ahead. uscis recommends that you file an extension application at least 45 days before your stay expires. to find out when your b 1 visa expires  you will need to look at a copy of your uscis form i 94  which is your arrival   departure record. in the lower right hand corner of that record  you will see your visa s expiration date. an extension will only be granted if you are in the united states lawfully and your b 1 visa has not expired.in some circumstances  you may find that your business travels will not last as long as your visa  in which case you will not need to get an extension. for example  assume you have a three month training in the united states and you were granted a six month b 1 visa. if  after your three month training was completed  you were asked to stay for another two month training  your visa would cover the extended stay. therefore  in this situation  you would not need to ask for an extension.    in order to be eligible fro a b 1 visa extension  you must not have committed any serious crimes during your stay in the united states.for example  any crime involving moral turpitude can make you ineligible. moral turpitude is not clearly defined within the law but is considered to be any crime  regardless of its seriousness  that involves some sort of moral wrong  e.g.  lying  fraud  evil intent  recklessness .in addition  a lot of drug crimes and prostitution are considered ineligibilities.however  something like a parking ticket or speeding ticket is not likely going to make you ineligible unless you lie about it or try to evade punishment. at that point  it could turn into a crime of moral turpitude. a more complete list of disqualifying crimes can be found on uscis form i 539  part 4.  when you were granted your initial b 1 visa  you received it because you met certain eligibility criteria. for example  your reason for entering the united states must be for a legitimate business reason  you must have the funds available to support yourself throughout your stay  and you must only intend to stay for a short period of time.in order to get an extension  you must have abided by  and continue to abide by  these conditions.for example  you might be denied an extension if you do not have the funds available to continue to support yourself while in the united states. while this is not a crime  it could be a violation of one of the conditions of your being in the united states.    in order to extend your visit in the united states  your passport must remain valid for the entire length of your stay.if your passport will expire while in the united states  you will not be granted an extension and you will have to go to your home country to get a new passport.   for example  assume you received a b 1 visa that lasts two months. further assume your passport  at the time you received your visa  had three months before it expired. if you wanted to extend your b 1 visa for an extra two months  i.e.  you want to stay in the united states for four months total   you would be unable to do so because your passport will expire before those four months are up.    if you are eligible for a b 1 visa extension  you will need to file a request with uscis. this request will need to be filed on uscis form i 539.form i 539 is the application to extend change nonimmigrant status. this form can be obtained by visiting the uscis website.if you do not have consistent access to

part 2 of your application requires you to check a series of boxes telling uscis what type of application you are filing. because you are filing for a b 1 visa extension  you will most likely check the box numbered  1  in part 2. next  assuming you are the only applicant  you will check the box numbered  4  in part 2.  the final pieces of your application ask you to provide uscis with some information that will help them process your application. for example  you need to provide uscis with how much of an extension you need  information about your current passport  and information about the circumstances of your stay in the united states. all of this information will be input in part 4 of form i 539.  part 5 of form i 539 asks you to certify that you understand the form you are filling out. in addition  after you make this certification  you will sign and date the form. if you had the help of an interpreter  they will also need to sign the form and answer a few questions.  once your i 539 is complete  you must attach your original i 94.if you do not have your original i 94  you can obtain a copy from the united states customs and border protection  cbp . to do this

you are going to have to prove the legitimacy of your extended stay. this means you will have to provide uscis with documentation that will convince them that your extension is legitimate and necessary. the documentation you provide might include written statements from business associates  pamphlets from training programs  a list of references  and financial statements proving that you have paid for the training classes.    the uscis website provides all the information you need about where to send your completed application and attachments. if you do not have consistent access to

p.o. box 660166  dallas  tx 75266.be sure you check with uscis often to ensure you are sending your application to the correct location.   while there are other addresses where an i 539 can be sent  those addresses are for different  unrelated processing actions. for example  someone filing for a v visa would send their forms to chicago.    before you mail your application  you need to attach a check or money order to cover the filing fee. as of 2016  the filing fee is  290. the check or money order you use will have to be drawn on a bank or other financial institution within the united states and must be payable in united states currency. the check or money order must be made out to  u.s. department of homeland security . it cannot be made out to  usdhs  or  dhs .  if you are filing your extension application at least 45 days in advance of your b 1 visa expiring  you should have your application processed before your authorized stay expires. the sooner you file the better. however  if you file your extension application after your visa expiration date  you will have to include a written statement with your application that demonstrates the following the delay in filing was due to extraordinary circumstances that were out of your control the delay in filing was reasonable you have not violated your status in any other way you are still a nonimmigrant you are not currently taking part in removal proceedings    once you have your entire application package put together  send it to the correct address. at this point  your extension application will be considered filed. you cannot currently file uscis form i 539 online.  once your application has been received by uscis  they will send you a receipt in the mail. the receipt you receive will have tracking information and instructions to help you check the progress of your application.  the time it takes uscis to process your application varies depending on the complexity of your case and how many applications are coming in at any given time. the uscis website offers an interactive chart you can use to estimate how long your application will take to process. to use the chart  visit the website and choose the field office or service center that is handling your application. based on this information  uscis will give you a date when you can expect a decision.  when uscis reviews your application  they will initially look for completeness. if you do not completely fill out your extension application  which includes any required attachments  your application may be denied. in addition  if you fail to sign your form i 539 or send in the correct fee  your application will not even be accepted. if this happens  you will have the opportunity to correct these things and refile.  in some cases  uscis might request additional information and may even ask to conduct an interview.if you get one of these requests  make sure you comply in a timely manner. failure to do so may result in your application being denied.    uscis will inform you of their decision in writing.even if you are eligible and you fill out your forms correctly  the final decision is discretionary and is made based on a number of factors  e.g.  your situation  your status  and your reason for wanting to stay . if uscis grants your extension  they will determine how long you can stay. in general  a b 1 visa can be extended up to a maximum of six months.

and network protocols  and databases and information modeling. you can also view do an internet search for the complete list of recommended topics by professor matthew might  who teaches computing at the university of utah.  basic computer programming is simple and easy to learn  and is a great gateway to more computer science knowledge. plus  it comes in handy on job applications to have a working knowledge of programming  even if you don t have technical instruction under your belt.   there are a lot of different programming  languages   or systems that use unique codes. if you don t know where to start  python is a nice language for beginners. it s intuitive and easy to learn. you can also consider c or java. if you have tried imperative programming languages in the past  try learning functional languages such as haskell.these are more advanced than the basic languages. whatever approach you decide to take  you can do an internet search for articles or videos that will teach you all you need to know. in your search bar  type in the name of the programming method plus the words  beginner tutorial   for example   java beginner tutorial  .    if you know early on that you have an interest in computer science  it is helpful to focus your high school curriculum on courses that will give you an advantage in college and in your career.   try to focus on courses in mathematics  science  and computing. it is likely that you already gravitate toward these types of classes  but if not  ask yourself whether computer science is really right for you. computer scientists must have an aptitude for science  math  and information  and the ability to problem solve and think logically. maintain a good grade point average and standardized test scores so you can apply to top programs in the field.    this is the best way to begin a serious study of computer science  preparing you for a career in the field. you ll have access to the best resources and experienced teachers.   if you know specifically what you want to study in computer science  look for the highest rated college or university with a program in that field in your area. otherwise  look for a school with a strong information technology program and professors who can mentor you as you choose your specialization.    having experience in jobs that utilize some of the basic concepts of computer science can help you learn more about the discipline and also bolster your resume so that you will be able to find a good job when you get out of school.   try to find part time  summer  or work study experience related to computing  engineering  mathematics  or other technological fields. you may not get hands on experience with actual computer programming in your early stages of work  but even being in the same room with computer scientists will allow you to make connections  ask questions  and learn more. consider working as a lab assistant or a library aid. get an internship that will give you hands on experience with computer science  for instance at a software development company or at a computer help desk at a major corporation or university.  most computer scientists get at least a bachelor s degree  but some fields will hire a candidate with only an associate s. in general  an associate s degree takes two years and a bachelor s degree takes four.   your coursework will emphasize math  science  and technology  but you should also be sure to take courses in english  or other native language in the country where you study and plan to work   writing  and the humanities.    there are many options for what to do with a degree in computer science  including systems analyst  database administrator  hardware engineer  data scientist  help desk technician  security specialist  and many others.look online on career websites  classifieds  or the websites of particular companies. many corporate websites list open positions in computer science under the category of  support  or  it   information technology . look for an entry level position that sounds interesting to you  you can also ask professors and work supervisors for job recommendations and help locating open positions.    remember that even after you ve found a job in computer science  computers will constantly evolve and change  and so must your skills in order for you to remain relevant and keep your job secure.many big tech companies offer continuing education courses  seminars  or conferences. you can also enroll in night classes at a local college  or ask your employer if they will help subsidize courses you can take from home. it s a good idea to subscribe to technology blogs  magazines  or listservs in order to keep up with changing protocols and languages.    getting an advanced degree  such as a master s or doctorate  is a time consuming and costly choice  so before you enroll  be sure you are making the right choice.   of all fields of study  computer science is one of the most likely to pay off. advanced degree holders in computer science are in demand  so if you plan to hunt for a better paying job and you re willing to move  particularly to a large city   an advanced degree might be a good way to get there.however  if you are happy in your current job and have no desire to look for another position  it might be wise to not pursue another degree. if you need to learn another programming language or further your skills  your current employer might have policies in place to pay for continuing education seminars or other ways for you to further your knowledge without another degree.    before starting on a master s or doctorate  you need to have a bachelor s under your belt. it is ideal if the undergraduate degree is in a field related to computer science  mathematics  or another closely related discipline.   however  with high enough grades and test scores  you might be accepted to a graduate program even without having focused on computer science for your bachelor s degree  particularly if you can show a long standing interest in and aptitude for technology.    for most graduate schools in the united states  you will have to take the graduate record examination  gre  test  which tests your analytical writing  quantitative  and verbal reading comprehension skills.for an advanced degree in computer science  you will need to show an aptitude for numbers  so your quantitative score will most likely need to be excellent. high scores in the other areas are also important for competitive program admission  but are likely to be slightly less important than quantitative scores. for example  at the university of chicago s master s in computer science program  successful applicants generally score at least in the 50th percentile or above on the verbal section  and in the 80th percentile or above on the quantitative section. if you re applying to a united states program from overseas  you may also have to take the test of english as a foreign language  toefl .check with the programs you are interested in to see what you need to score for admission.    keep in mind that you may not get into your first choice school  so having a backup plan or applying to several schools is usually a good idea.   an application usually consists of application form  a resume or curriculum vitae  a letter of interest that explains why you think the program is a good fit for you  letters of reference  and a of your undergraduate transcript. if you plan to start graduate school directly after completing your undergraduate  be sure to plan ahead when you schedule your standardized tests and your applications. most application cycles begin the fall before you would actually start school  that is  a full year in advance   and most require completed tests to apply. that means you ll have to complete your standardized readiness exams over a year before attending graduate school.  
query	125	discover secrets aristotle write a philosophy paper  writing a good philosophy paper takes time and careful planning  so make sure that you begin working on the assignment as soon as possible. philosophy papers require skillful argument and rational thought  which takes time to develop.try to begin developing your ideas for your philosophy paper as soon as you get the assignment. jot down your ideas and use some of your spare time to think about what you want to write about.    before you begin to develop your ideas for the paper  make sure that you have carefully read all of the materials that are related to the assignment. if you read the materials  but do not remember much or do not understand part of what you read  then you should reread the texts before you attempt to work on your paper.having a solid understanding of the concepts covered in your readings is essential to create an effective paper. otherwise  your explanation of the philosophy may be flawed or your argument may not hold up.    some professors distribute assignment guidelines while others simply describe the assignment in class. before you start working on your paper  make sure that you have a clear understanding of what your professor is asking you to do.if any part of the assignment is unclear  ask your professor for clarification.    it is important to keep your audience in mind as you plan your paper and as you write your paper. your professor is your primary audience member and your classmates might also be part of your audience.you can also think of your audience as a person who has some knowledge of philosophy  but who does not have the same understanding as you do. therefore  if you introduce a special term or concept  you will need to define it for your audience.    with philosophy papers  it is best to use quotes from the text only when it is absolutely necessary. the goal of your paper is to explain and evaluate a philosophical argument in your own words. therefore  you should not rely too heavily on quotes or even paraphrased passages from your sources.only use a quote when it is necessary to support your point of view. make sure to provide a citation for every quote or paraphrase that you use from a source. include the author s name as well as a page number.    all philosophy papers need to have a strong thesis. your thesis states your position for the paper and you will need to make sure that you stay focused on your thesis and support it throughout your entire paper. keep in mind that a strong thesis states your position as well as why you hold that position.for example  if you plan to refute aristotle s idea that beauty is related to virtue  then you would have to provide a brief explanation of why. one reason that you may cite might be that beautiful people are not always virtuous. in this case  your thesis might be something like   aristotle s concept that beauty is related to virtue is false because beauty is often found in those who lack virtue.  you will need to place your thesis at the end of the first paragraph in your essay.    an outline can help you to stay on track as you draft your paper and ensure that you include everything that you need to include.try making a simple outline that includes    ideas for your introduction your thesis main points of your explanation main points in your evaluation along with supporting evidence potential objections and your refutations ideas for your conclusion    writing in a flowery  overly complex way will not make you appear to be more knowledgeable about philosophy. it is better to write in your own voice and use simple  direct language to get your point across. imagine that you are explaining the concept to a friend and making an argument for why you agree or disagree with this concept. what would you say  what examples would you use try to avoid padding your work with extra words. this makes it hard for your readers to understand what you mean. look up new words before you used them. if you like to sue the thesaurus feature ow word when you write  just make sure that you are looking up the meanings of these words before you include them. the thesaurus does not always provide suggestions that are grammatically correct or equivalent in meaning to the original word.    your introduction is important because it gives readers a first impression of your paper. the introduction is your chance to grab your readers  attention and to provide a preview of your argument. that is why it is important to use your introduction wisely.avoid introductions that provide a sweeping overview of your topic  such as  since the dawn of time   or  all people everywhere have wondered .  instead  jump right into the topic. for example  you might lead in with something like   aristotle often draws a line between beauty and virtue in his work.     after your introduction  you will need to explain the philosophical argument or concept that you are planning to refute or support. make sure that you present the philosopher s ideas in a clear  objective manner.do not add or leave out any details that might provide you with an advantage when you start to evaluate the philosophy. otherwise  your professor may consider your argument to be less effective. stick to the relevant details of the argument. do not explain things that you do not plan to argue against in your paper unless they are absolutely necessary for understanding your point.  after you have provided a clear explanation of the philosophy  you will need to move on to your evaluation. your evaluation should work to support your thesis at all times. do not go back and forth between positions or contradict yourself at any time. stick to your position no matter what.one great way to support your thesis is by using examples that you draw from personal experiences or that you create. for example  if you are arguing that beauty and virtue are unrelated  then you might give an example of a convicted criminal who many consider to be beautiful.    a good argument should also acknowledge and refute any objections you re your opponents might have. try to identify the strongest objections that an opponent might use to refute your argument and develop responses to these objections.don t worry about handling every single objection. focus on handling the three biggest objections that your opponents might raise. for example  if you are arguing that beauty and virtue are not related  then you might identify an objection that some studies have demonstrated that some men are less attracted to women with undesirable personality traits  despite their beauty.    conclusions are also important because they provide an opportunity for you to summarize  clarify  and emphasize one or more important parts of your paper. try to conclude your paper in a way that will help your readers to see the relevance and significance of your paper.for example  you might explain what your paper has established or how it has added to a philosophical conversation.if your paper is about aristotle s concept of the relationship between virtue and beauty  you might discuss how your findings demonstrate the modern separation of image and personality.    revising is easier if you can take a break from what you have written for a few days. after you return to the paper again  you will have a fresh perspective that should help you to improve the content of your work more easily than if you had attempted to revise it right away.   if possible set aside your paper for at least three days  but keep in mind that even setting aside your paper for a few hours before you revise is better than nothing.    revision is not about fixing typos and grammatical errors. revision is about seeing what you have written with new eyes and being willing to make major changes  additions  and deletions if it will improve the content of your paper.when you revisit your paper  read it with a focus on the content. do your arguments hold up  if not  how might you improve them  are the concepts in your paper clear and easy to understand  if not  how might you clarify these concepts     having someone else take a look at your paper can also help you to improve your work. someone who is not too familiar with philosophy may also help you to identify areas where you could offer more helpful details.   try asking a classmate or friend  preferably someone who you know to be a good writer  to take a look at your paper and give you some feedback. many universities also have writing centers where students can make an appointment and get some feedback from a trained writing tutor. this can also help you to develop effective strategies for revising your own work. you can also make an appointment with your professor if he or she is willing to provide feedback before you submit the paper. just make sure that you request an appointment at least one week before the paper is due. otherwise  your professor may not have time to meet with you.    proofreading is the final step in the writing process where you check for minor errors and correct them as needed. these little errors can distract your readers  so take time to proofread your work before you submit your final draft.to proofread  go through your paper and correct any typos  grammatical errors  or other minor flaws before you print and or submit your work. try reading your paper out loud or reading it backwards one sentence at a time. mark any errors you find with a highlighter or pencil.

query	130	provide scoring jason kidd play shuffleboard  shuffleboard tables  commonly found in bars  have a polished wood surface and range from 12 to 22 feet  3.6 to 6.6 m  in length. the table s height is usually 30 inches  75 cm  and its width is 20 inches  50 cm . lines are drawn 6 and 12 inches  15 and 30 cm  from the far end. a foul line is drawn 6 feet  1.8 m  from the far end  disks must cross this line without falling off the table to be eligible to score points.  the discs should be marked to distinguish one side s pieces from the other side s pieces  however  the disks are usually marked with red or blue. there are only two sides  players play solo or in teams of two.    have a team or player call heads or tails  then toss a coin. if the side the team or player called is what turns up  then they go first. if not  then the other team or player goes first.    have players or teams alternate sliding their disks across the table until all disks are cast. the goal of shuffleboard is to get your disk to the furthest point on the board while also trying to knock the other players  disks off of the board. when playing table shuffleboard in teams  you may also try to knock your partner s disks into a higher scoring area.    if you are playing in teams  then only the player or team whose disks are furthest down the table scores points  and only those disks further down than the opponent s furthest disk score.if a disk hangs over the far end of the table  it scores 4 points. if a disk crosses the far line without hanging over the far end  it scores 3 points. if a disk crosses the nearer scoring line  it scores 2 points. if a disk crosses the foul line  but no other lines  it scores 1 point. if the disk touches or crosses any of the lines  it scores the value of the lower scoring area. thus  if a disk has crossed the 3 point line but is still touching it  it scores only 2 points. in some versions of table shuffleboard  a less skilled player scores 1 more point for a hanger or crossing the lines than a more skilled opponent does. you may observe this rule if you choose  just make sure to specify that this rule will be in effect before you start playing.    some table shuffleboard games play from only one end  while others play from either end. whichever player or team won the last turn starts the next turn. in a 2 player game  the first player to either 11 or 15 points wins the game. in a team game  the first team to 21 points wins the game.    outdoor shuffleboard features a 52 foot long  15.6 m long  rectangular court with a triangular scoring area at either end.have all of the players come and stand around the board.    you will be using a cue to push the disks down the shuffleboard court. disks are in 2 colors  usually yellow and black  with a diameter of 6 inches  15 cm  and a thickness from 9 16 to 1 inch  1.4 to 2.5 cm . the cue is a pole no longer than 6 1 2 feet  2 m   with a u shaped prong on the pushing end.    have the players or teams alternate sliding their disks across the court until all of the disks are cast. starting with the player with the yellow disks  players place their disks in the  10 off  section of the scoring area on their end of the court on their turn and shoot toward the opposite scoring triangle.   the yellow player s disks are launched on the left side of the court  and the black player s disks are launched from the right side. a player s cue cannot push past the scoring area when shooting a disk. disks must cross the  dead line  3 feet  0.9 m  in front of the opposite scoring area but must not hang off the edge of the court  disks that fail to cross or that hang are removed from the court. as in table shuffleboard  players try to knock their disks into the higher scoring areas and their opponents into lower scoring areas or out of play entirely.    the triangular scoring area in outdoor shuffleboard is divided into 6 sections  a disk must be entirely inside one of these sections to score points. a disk in the apex of the triangle scores 10 points  a disk in either of the 2 areas behind the apex scores 8 points  and a disk in either of the 2 areas behind the 8 point areas scores 7 points. a disk that lands in the  10 off  section deducts 10 points from the score of the player or team who owns the disk.   unlike table shuffleboard  outdoor shuffleboard assesses penalties for rule infractions. a disk that touches the 10 off area line before being played costs a player 5 points  if it touches one of the triangle s sides  the penalty is 10 points. ten point penalties are also assessed if a player s body crosses the baseline while playing or shooting an opponent s disk. remove any illegally played disks from the court. give any of the opponent s disks that were displaced by an illegally played disks back to the opponent to replay.    alternate sliding disks from either end of the court until one side wins. whichever side reaches a score of 75 or more after all of the disks are played in a turn wins.    deck shuffleboard has 2 oval scoring areas  each 6 feet  1.8 m  in length  spaced 30 feet  9 m  apart. there are lines in front of and behind each scoring area  the inside lines are called  lady s lines  and the outside lines are called  gentleman s lines.   the disks are the same size as in outdoor shuffleboard and they are marked with two separate colors. the cues are similar to those in outdoor shuffleboard  although the shooting section  or  shoe   consists of a semicircle cut into a rectangular piece of wood.players may play in teams of 2  with one player playing one end of the court and the other the other end.    this is usually done with a coin toss  as in table shuffleboard.  keep going until all of the disks have been cast. players stand behind the  gentleman s line  when shooting. during play  players can try to knock their opponent s disks out of the scoring area or off the court.take any disks that fail to cross the lady s line off the court.    tally up the points after all players have cast their disks. disks score points according to where in the scoring area they land  as long as they are completely inside that scoring area.   the center of the scoring area consists of 9 squares labeled with the numbers 1 through 9  arranged in the format of a magic square  any line of 3 numbers adds to 15. the semicircle furthest from the players scores 10 points for any disk landing in it  while the semicircle nearest the players deducts 10 points for any disk landing in it.    whichever side reaches a score of either 50 or 100 first  wins.  shuffleboard is played on a table 20 to 30 feet  6 to 9 m  long and 3 feet  0.9 m  wide. at either end  scoring lines are drawn at 4 inches  10 cm  and 4 feet  1.2 m  from the end.  each player s disks should be marked in some way to distinguish them from the other players  disks.    for two players  toss a coin. if there are more than two players  choose another method with an equal outcome.    have the players alternate sliding their disks across the table until all of the disks have been cast. a disk must cross one of the lines without falling off the table.   once a player has slid a disk across the table  it becomes a target for the other players  who can knock that disk off the table and replace it with their own disk.    a disk that hangs over the far end of the table scores 3 points  a disk on or across the far line scores 2 points  and a disk on or across the near line scores 1 point. if none of the disks have crossed a line  the disk closest to the near line scores 1 point. add the scores to the players  previous scores.  whoever scored the most points on the last turn starts the next turn. the first player to score 11 wins.   if there are more than two players  the winning score can be higher than 11.

often  after obtaining a college degree  they will begin graduate work. graduate work is done at a theology school  which is associated with a university. an example of the degree earned is a master of divinity.    your spiritual journey is important  so it s a big choice to decide where to hone the skills you need to follow your progressing vocation. consider many different schools. ask yourself if you want a well rounded spiritual education  or if you want to focus solely on learning more about catholic doctrine. make sure to visit the campus before finalizing your decision.   talk to students who currently attend the school you are considering. also ask alumnae about their experience. think about whether that particular program will help you grow both spiritually and intellectually.    once you become a priest  you want to make sure that you excel at your job. this is the best way to earn a promotion in the ranks of the church. a good priest is dependable  and helps the members of his church and the community.as a priest  you are responsible for the spiritual well being of your congregation. you will preform sacraments  conduct mass  and hear confession. an exemplary priest earns the designation  monsignor .    after you are a priest  any promotion that you receive will be by appointment. this means that you need to make a good impression on people who are in leadership positions above you. work on relating well to others in your field.be an effective communicator. make sure that you are comfortable speaking in front of a crowd. you already do this as a priest  and it will become more important as you advance in the church. be confident and clear when you speak. work well with others. as a bishop or cardinal  you will need to manage other priests. practice listening to the needs of others  and effectively communicating instructions.    a bishop is essentially the chief priest  or pastor  of a diocese. a diocese is the territory or region that contains the churches under a bishop s authority. an archbishop governs his diocese and also oversees other bishops. the pope is responsible for choosing all bishops. therefore  you need to make a good impression on those who advise him.make sure that you are in regular communication with the archbishop for your region. he will be able to offer a positive recommendation when asked for his opinion about you. bishops gather for regular meetings  where they set policy and liturgical standards for their region. the pope is responsible for appointing bishops. he relies on existing bishops to provide him with recommendations. remember  you cannot formally apply to become a bishop. you must be appointed. the pope s chief adviser in this process is the apostolic nuncio. he is the pope s representative to the government and church hierarchy in individual countries.    a cardinal is a bishop who is chosen by the pope to receive this special designation. the pope selects archbishops to serve as cardinal of a specific diocese. not all regions have a cardinal.areas with significant catholic populations  such as boston and baltimore  are often where the pope chooses to create a cardinal. make sure you live in a region that has a cardinal. you will not be likely to rise to this position from a small  rural population. when you are a bishop  maintain a positive relationship with the cardinal of your area. make it clear that you are eager to serve the church  and demonstrate your effective administrative skills. cardinals are active in the administration of the catholic church. there is not a formal application or interview process to become a cardinal. you must be appointed by the pope.    since a new pope is usually only chosen every few decades  it is important to be prepared. make sure that you are in communication with the members of the college of cardinals. by now you should have established a good professional reputation. as conclave approaches  continue working to demonstrate that you would make a positive public figure.in the days following the funeral of the pope  the cardinals gather to prepare for conclave. this is where  politicking  occurs. try to assess who your supporters are. make it clear to the other cardinals that you are willing to accept the nomination.    the official process for electing a pope is known as  conclave . the governing group of cardinals  known as the college of cardinals  gather together to chose a new pope. this group gathers in the sistine chapel. all others are barred from entry.  conclave  in latin means  locked with a key  literally. typically  the current must die in order for conclave to convene. it is extremely rare for a pope to resign. the cardinals gather 15 20 days after the death of the pope to conduct a secret ballot. only the cardinals are allowed in the chapel. there are a few exceptions  such as medical personnel. each cardinal must take a solemn oath that he will adhere to the rules of conclave  as written by pope john paul ii. after the first day of conclave  two votes may be taken each morning  and two each afternoon.    it is not considered appropriate to  campaign  for pope. however  being a well known and respected cardinal is a job only a select few hold. there are usually only a small group of candidates considered at conclave. the man with the most votes is elected as the new pope.there are three phases to the actual voting process  pre scrutiny  where the ballots are prepared  scrutiny  where the ballots are collected and counted  and post scrutiny  where the ballots are checked again and then burned. conclave can last several days  but generally does not last longer than two weeks. a cardinal must receive 2 3 of the votes in order to be elected pope. after each vote  the ballots are burned. if black smoke is seen coming from the chapel  it means there will be another vote. white smoke signals the election of a new pope.    the pope is the spiritual leader of the catholic people of the world. currently  there are approximately 1.2 billion catholics. the pope is also head of the world s smallest sovereign state  the vatican.the pope presides over a weekly blessing for people visiting the vatican. he also offers a general audience each week. the pope presides over all major religious celebrations  such as christmas and easter. modern popes travel around the world  meeting catholics and world leaders.

promising and not so promising teams. look for information on programs  late season injuries  winning and losing streaks  and post season playing history  which may indicate how a team approaches high pressure elimination games.   look for teams ranked really high who have been badly blown out in a loss during the regular season   these teams are statistically unlikely to win it all. highly ranked teams who have suffered a blowout loss of double digits are statistically less likely to win it all. look for teams who score high on basketball analytics. sites such as kenpom offer a purely objective look at teams based on different metrics. of course  these sites can t measure intangibles  but looking at them can be a good way to figure out which teams may be better  or worse  than they actually appear. don t limit yourself to one particular site. national news may not have access to local details  while regional information can carry a heavy hometown bias.    the running joke among office pool participants is that the person with the least knowledge of the sport always wins the march madness pool. while it can happen  and is extremely frustrating  there s really no advantage in being ignorant. a lot of luck goes into the games themselves  but having good background information will give you an edge. you ll start to see which players step up in big games  which coaches have proven track records and who can t win away from their own arena. this knowledge will come in handy.    take seeding  or a team s rank  into account  but don t be a slave to it  there are often upsets  most notably in the number five to number 12 match ups in the first round. use your bracket s point system to maximize your gains  as some award more points based on the winning team s initial seeding.   know the trends. entering the 2008 tournament  no. 1 seeds are 92 0 against 16s. even if you think that a no. 16 will win this year  the odds say that you re probably wrong. it s not that you re not brave  it s that it s just not worth taking that sort of risk. in fact  don t risk taking any team above the 12 seed in the first round unless you re absolutely sure it s a mismatch. if you pick a 13  14  15  or 16 seed to win in the first round  you re picking against a team that  based on seeds  should be going to the sweet 16 as long as they take care of business. however  also realize that 12 v. 5 and 11 v. 6 games are upset city. usually at least one of each will win  so be on the lookout for which ones you think can make it past the first round. know that 10 v. 7 games are hardly upsets and 9s actually have a winning record over 8s since the beginning of the 65 team era. ignore rank completely starting in the elite eight. one study has shown that the tournament s last three rounds are statistical toss ups.  pay attention to teams  rebounding statistics  which indicate a team s ability to judge shot quality and capitalize on opponents  mistakes with second chance points and fast breaks.    study teams  offensive stats  free throws and three point shooting can be important factors in closing games and in overcoming deficits quickly  while assists can indicate the ability to create opportunities and adjust to opponents  defensive weaknesses  as well as the capacity to work well as a team.    focus on teams that can play both a zone and a man to man defense  and therefore adapt easily to the variety of teams they might face during the tournament.   look at teams who can execute a full court press. full court press is a little more popular in college basketball than it is in the pros  but it can translates to a couple more steals and fast break points per game.    try to find out the picks other people in your pool are making and deviate

query	139	find hidden talent samuel beckett discover your talents  because you are likely blind to what some of your talents really are  a good place to start when evaluating your talents is to just open your mind to the possibilities. keep in mind that talents extend beyond just playing the guitar or dancing like a pro. talents come in all shapes and sizes and extend into many areas of life.   for example  being able to read emotions very accurately is a very useful talent.    as you reflect on yourself in search of your talents  start by looking at your past. look at the things that you ve done. look at the things you ve enjoyed. look at the times when you really excelled. ask yourself questions like  what am i most proud of that i ve done   or  when was i so proud that i didn t care what anyone thought     one good thing to think about was what your childhood was like. what did you do a lot as a kid  what did you enjoy  what were you known for  sometimes this can reveal some of our deepest talents and certainly will reveal interests that can be probed further.think about your hobbies as your personality is made by them they are the things you do regularly and your hidden talent is that which you can do better than everyone so focus on your hobbies and how you do them every single step. another thing you can think about are the times in your life that you ve been challenged. think about the tough situations that you ve had to deal with. times of trial can often reveal our hidden skills. for example  when your dad had a heart attack  maybe you kept your head and called 911. staying alert and calm in an emergency is a really useful talent.    the things that make you happy can also reveal your talents. think about the things that you love to do. do people ever give you compliments on it  do they ever ask for your help with it  you might not think of it as a talent but it probably is.   do you ever completely lose track of time  you start doing something and you just don t even notice time passing  this might hint at your talent.for example  maybe you get lost when you re modding your favorite video game. this might be one of your talents. listen to how you talk. do you ever find yourself rambling to your family or your best friend about this subject that means so much to you  this might be another hint at a talent you have.    now  there s a big difference between what you enjoy and what you re good at. you might think of your talents only being things that you love doing  but it s important to remember that our talents are often things we don t enjoy or things we don t even think about. this is why it s important to take a long hard look at what you re actually good at.   think about things that come naturally to you. things you don t struggle with. do you ever find yourself telling someone   nevermind  it s easier if i do it  or  here  let me help you with that   do you find yourself correcting people  these behaviors usually indicate something that you re good at and know a lot about.    look back on your life and think about times where you really succeeded  times where you felt about to burst with the pride of your success. this can indicate a talent you possess.   for example  maybe you helped your boss rearrange and reorganize his office and helped things at your work run so much more smoothly. organization is a very useful talent.    this exercise can help you reveal not only the talents that you have but also talents that you should consider developing. write about what you were like as a kid  what you liked to do before and after school  what your favorite subjects were. write about growing up. write about where you re at in your life now. now  write about your future. write about where you want to go. write about what you want people to say at your funeral.   this exercise reveals your priorities and what you really think is important about yourself. it can also reveal what you want for your life  helping you focus on talents you should cultivate if you want to achieve your dreams.    having an outside perspective  other people may find it easier to see what you re good at. ask around and people will usually be happy to tell you what they see as your strengths. be sure to talk to people that know you well but also people that barely know you. both will see you in different ways and the differences that they see can tell you even more about yourself.    your life needs to have room for discovering your talents  if you spend all day on the couch after school or work or you spend all of your waking weekend hours at parties  then you re going to have very little time for self discovery. your talents will often lie in activities that you ve not tried yet and if you don t make time for those things  then you ll never expand beyond what you are now.   think about how you spend your time right now. consider your priorities and then find things that you can cut to make more time for new experiences.    while other people can help you find your talents  it s also important to take some time that s just for you. self discovery does require a lot of self reflection and if you re spending all of your time watching movies with your friends  you probably won t get the time you need to really understand yourself. take some quiet days that are just for you and spend them doing new activities.    you probably already have some basic skills. any skill that you possess can be turned into a real talent  but you need to take the time to develop it and really work on experiencing all of the different activities that go in to that talent. you might have experienced only a small aspect of a possible talent and you will need to experience much more if you really want to cultivate it.   for example  let s say that you re pretty good at interior design. you certainly made your room looks pretty nice. well  try developing that skill into a full talent. study up on interior design  mess around with computer programs for interior design  and cultivate an awesome pinterest. by investing in this skill and exploring it further  you can develop your minor skill into a talent.    sometimes we tell ourselves that we can t do things. maybe we think we re not good enough or not smart enough. most often we see ourselves as  not that kind of person . but the thing is that you don t know you re that kind of person until you start becoming that person. you have to give life a chance to surprise you. you re much more incredible and interesting than you give yourself credit for. take a risk and try something totally different than anything you ve ever tried before.   for example  try rock climbing. try scuba diving. write a book. start a business. these kinds of things take work but for many  they are at the very essence of who they are. it s a good idea to try to factor in things you already know you can do well. for example  you know that you like hanging out with little kids. from this you can say that you probably have a fun  easy going nature. this means you might excel at work with animals  which is similar and requires some of the same underlying traits.    if there s a subject that interests you and you think you might want to develop it into a talent  consider taking a class. getting more information and finding out what the experience would really be like can tell you if it s really something you could have a talent for. it also will help you get the basic skills needed to start developing your talent if you decide it s something that you want to do.   you can take online classes for free from websites like coursera and university of the the people  if you don t have access to education resources. if you do have money and time to devote to a class though  try your local community and technical colleges  as well as your local community center.    traveling is one of the most impactful experiences you can have. it will challenge you and teach you more about yourself than you thought possible. however  you can t just take the easy route and go on a cruise or guided trip. go on your own. go somewhere different from anywhere you ve ever been. immerse yourself in the experience. try new things. you ll find yourself struggling in some areas but you ll also find that there are other activities that you can do with ease or that make you really happy.   traveling can seem expensive but it really depends on where you go  when  and what you do. it doesn t have to be an expensive experience. you can also travel a little more close to home and get the same sort of benefits. for example  if you re from the us  try going out into the canadian countryside or a backpacking trip in mexico.    when we have to struggle  when we re removed from our usual comfortable environment  is when we learn the most about ourselves. when you shut yourself off to challenges by just sticking to a quiet life and never leaving the house  or even backing out when times get tough or running from your problems  you deny yourself the chance to shine. let challenges happen  try to tackle your problems  and get out and live life a bit more so that you have the chance to conquer challenges that you encounter.   for example  your grandma might get sick and need help. try helping her out. you might find that you re really good at connecting with and helping the elderly.    in experiencing just your own life and your own world  it s easy to have your mind closed to the possibilities  the possibilities of what you are and the possibilities of what you could be. when you help others in significant and impactful ways  you ll find that you see yourself in a new light. your priorities will change. you might even get the chance to shine in a talent you didn t even know you had  or build a new talent through the work you do.   for example  local parks departments often need help removing invasive plants or in building new structures like playgrounds. you can volunteer and you might find that you re good at identifying plants  woodworking  reading building plans  or organizing or motivating people.

query	145	take crudes angola treat malaria  you should be aware of the risk factors to know if there s a possibility you ve contracted the disease. in very rare cases  it can be spread through blood transfusions or organ transplants if the medical staff has made a mistake in screening the donor. sharing needles for injection can also spread the disease. however  because the disease is most often spread by mosquito bites  most people with malaria are found in tropical and subtropical climates.   the cdc offers a thorough listing of malaria risk by country.countries where you re highly likely to contract malaria include angola  cameroon  chad  c te d ivoire  and liberia  among others. the deadliest strains of malaria are found in africa  south of the sahara.note that the risk is posed not just to people who live in these countries  but also those traveling through them.    malaria normally has an incubation period of about seven to 30 days before symptoms begin appearing. but if you re a traveller from a low risk country  you may have taken preventative anti malarial medication before entering the country. if you contract malaria despite that medication  the medication can still slow down the disease s progression. it might take months for your symptoms to appear.to be safe  you should be vigilant for a full year after traveling to a high risk area. remind your doctor of your travels during every check up during that year.    uncomplicated malaria is the most common type  but it is rarely seen in hospital settings because people mistake it for cold  flu  or a simple infection. residents of high risk areas often recognize the symptoms as uncomplicated malaria and treat it on their own. severe malaria  on the other hand  can cause organ failure and is potentially lethal. it requires immediate medical attention. relapses after an initial bout of malaria often go unnoticed because they may not always present with noticeable symptoms.    during these bouts  patients progress from the cold stage  through the hot stage  then the sweating stage.   in the cold stage  they feel cold and shiver. during the hot stage  they experience fever  headaches  and vomiting. children may experience seizures. in the sweating stage  the patient experiences fatigue and excessive sweating while the body returns to a normal temperature. other symptoms include yellowed skin from mild jaundice and rapid breathing.    many people have nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue  headaches  nausea  vomiting  or body aches.if the infection progresses to a stage where it interferes with organ  blood  or metabolism function  symptoms become more dramatic. severe malaria is potentially lethal  and requires immediate medical attention. contact your doctor or emergency services if you experience any of the following    strange behavior changes loss of consciousness seizures anemia  you may look pale  feel very tired or weak  have dizziness  or have a rapid heart rate  dark or reddish urine  from hemoglobin  trouble breathing abnormal blood coagulation low blood pressure kidney failure  decreased urine  swollen legs or feet from fluid retention  chest pain or pressure low blood sugar  especially in pregnant women     while those in high risk areas sometimes  wait and see  if uncomplicated malaria will progress  people in low risk areas should not. if you have any suspicion that you have malaria  you should contact your doctor immediately to get tested and treated.    even if your first blood smear comes back negative for malaria parasites  the doctor will repeat the test every eight to 12 hours for 36 hours.   the doctor may also order a rapid blood test to indicate whether there s significant risk of malaria. if the initial rapid blood test is positive  he or she will order blood smears to confirm the diagnosis. your doctor will also test your blood for a cbc and test the function of your liver and possibly other organs.    although malaria can be dangerous and deadly  it s also a highly treatable disease. while there s not yet a vaccine to prevent contracting the disease  early treatment has proven to be very effective at containing and curing it.the success of your treatment depends on contacting your healthcare provider as soon as possible.    he or she will choose a regimen for you based on what type of malaria parasite was found in your blood smear  your age  whether you re pregnant  and the severity of your symptoms. most malaria treatments are taken orally  but patients with complications might need iv medication. like any living organism  the parasites that cause malaria can adapt to fight off medications  but the following drugs have a high success rate    chloroquine  aralen  quinine sulfate  qualaquin  hydroxychloroquine  plaquenil  mefloquine combination of atovaquone and proguanil  malarone     because there are so many options for treating malaria  not everyone will have the same experience. however  common side effects include blurred vision  nausea  diarrhea  vomiting  and stomach pain or upset. some of the drugs also cause heartburn  insomnia  anxiety or mental clouding  and dizziness or coordination problems.   pay attention to your body to pick up on these side effects  and report them to your doctor when you experience them. they may be able to give you additional medications to help combat them. drink lots of fluids to prevent heartburn. fluids are especially important if you are experiencing vomiting or diarrhea. you lose a lot of water through these side effects  and have to rehydrate yourself to keep your body as healthy as possible. stick to a bland diet to treat stomach upset. stay off your feet  and don t over exert yourself if you re having coordination problems. your doctor will monitor you for signs of dehydration  anemia  and seizures. she will watch for complications affecting your organs.    if everything goes according to plan and you don t suffer any complications  your fever should be gone within 36 48 hours. in most cases  the bacteria that cause malaria will be completely out of your system within two to three days  and you will be recovered within two weeks.the doctor will continue to test your blood smears while you re being treated for malaria. if the treatment is successful  they will see a decrease in the number of malaria parasites in your blood with every smear.    though this often happens without noticeable symptoms  you may feel flu like symptoms during relapses. either way  you want to prevent the infection from returning as best you can. primaquine is an anti malarial taken after other drugs have killed off the malaria parasites in your blood.   you will begin taking primaquine two weeks after the malaria has passed. your dosage and length of treatment will be based on your specific case  what kind of infection you had and how you responded to treatment. most often  a two week course is recommended. follow your doctor s instruction exactly. do not adjust dosages up or down in any way  and take the medication on the exact schedule prescribed.    additional mosquito bites may prove disastrous. if you live in an area where malaria is common  protect yourself as best as possible.   cover your skin with long pants and sleeves  even in hot weather. wear mosquito repellent at all times. look specifically for products containing deet  picaridin  oil of lemon eucalyptus  ole  or pmd  or ir3535. check the packaging to make sure your products have these effective chemicals in them. light mosquito repellent candles to keep mosquitos out of your area. stay in screened in  air conditioned areas where mosquitos are less likely to be. use bed nets when sleeping in areas infested with mosquitoes.

query	147	fire naphtha chennai make torches  a minimalistic torch is ideal when you don t have access to many resources  such as when you re in the woods without the right equipment. to make this kind of fast burning torch in an emergency  you ll need green stick or branch that s at least 2 feet  61 cm  long and 2 inches  5 cm  thick cotton cloth or birch bark fuel  such as kerosene  naphtha based camp fuel  lighter fluid  or rendered animal or vegetable fat matches or lighter    a torch needs a wick  just like a candle does. you can use strips of cotton to make the wick  such as from an old cotton t shirt. cut or tear the fabric into strips that are 1 foot  30 cm  wide and 2 feet  61 cm  long.   alternatively  you can use a strip of birch bark if you don t have fabric. find a birch tree and peel a strip that s about 6 inches  15 cm  wide and 2 feet  61 cm  long.if you re using bark  you ll also need twine  rope  string  or some reeds to tie it in place.    position the widthwise end of the cotton strip at the top of the green branch. wrap the strip snugly around the top of the torch  wrapping in the same place to form a thick bulge. when you reach the end of the fabric  tuck the end underneath the wrapped fabric to secure it in place.for birch bark  wrap the bark snugly around the end of the torch. when you get to the end of the bark  hold the bark in place and tie a string or reed around the top and bottom of the wick to hold the bark in place.    a cotton wick needs to be soaked in a flammable liquid before you can light the torch  because it s actually the fluid that will burn and not the fabric. place the wick end of the torch into the fuel and let it soak for a few minutes to ensure the fabric is saturated.   with a birch wick  you don t have to soak the wick because the bark contains natural resins that will burn.  use a light  matches  or a campfire. hold the torch upright and hold the flame to the base of the wick until the wick ignites. this may take about a minute. once lit  the torch should last at least 20 minutes  and could burn as long as an hour.a birch wick may only burn for about 15 minutes.   don t burn your torch in dry  heavily wooded areas  as you could set the surrounding wood on fire. don t burn the torch inside houses or buildings. hold the torch at arm s length to avoid burning yourself.    a cattail torch is another type of minimalistic torch that requires only a few simple items. with this type of torch  the spike on the end of the plant will be soaked in flammable fluid. along with the cattail  you ll also need    hollow reed  stick  cane  or bamboo piece fuel matches or lighter    the best place to look for cattails is around the perimeter of lakes  ponds  marshes  and other wetland areas. you may also know this plant by the names reedmace  cumbungi  or bulrush.because cattails are rather flimsy  you ll also need to find a hollow stick or cane that you can insert the cattail into. the stick will act as a holder. make sure it s at least 2 feet  61 cm  long.    place the cattail into your flammable liquid or oil. let the cattail soak for at least an hour. this will give the spike time to absorb lots of oil  which means a longer burning torch.good fuels for this purpose include kerosene  naphtha based camp fuel  lighter fluid  or rendered animal or vegetable fat    when the cattail is done soaking  insert the bottom of the cattail into your hollow stick so the oil soaked spike is protruding from the top of the stick. with a lighter or matches  hold a flame to the bottom of the spike until it ignites.   a cattail torch could give you up to six hours of flame.don t burn these torches inside or near other flammable objects. hold the torch away from your body to avoid burns.    this type of torch requires more tools and specialized equipment than the other types. this is not a minimalistic torch that you can make in an emergency. to make this type of torch  you ll need aluminum pole that s at least an inch  2.5 cm  thick and 2 feet  61 cm  long kevlar fabric kevlar twine scissors 2 quarter inch  6 mm  self drilling aluminum screws drill or screwdriver bucket naphtha based camp fuel old towel matches or lighter    use the scissors to cut a strip of kevlar fabric that s about 4 inches  10 cm  wide and 2 feet  61 cm  long. you can buy kevlar fabric at some home stores  department and hardware stores  fabric stores  or online.   kevlar is a durable synthetic fabric that s made from plastic. however  it s flame resistant and doesn t melt  making it ideal for torches.kevlar is often used by fire jugglers and fire poi performers.    place the widthwise end of the fabric strip at the top of the pole. drill or screw a self drilling screw through the fabric and into the pole at the top and bottom edges of the fabric. position the screws a half inch  13 mm  from the top and bottom edges.aluminum has a smooth surface  and to prevent the kevlar wick from sliding down the torch

query	159	get into a bar in kelowna kelowna buy drinks in pubs in the united kingdom  you will never get table service in a pub for drinks. well  let s not say never. you will get table service in the occasional snooty london wine bar. suffice to say that if you don t look at the drinks menu and think   are these prices for bottles or glasses   then you re not getting table service. you re also unlikely to find a drinks menu on your table  to find out which drinks they have  you generally need to go to the bar and look at the beer taps. they may also have some sort of board on the wall showing beer and wine. on the up side you will never be expected to tip for drinks. once you ve decided what you and your party want to drink  someone will have to go to the bar and buy the round.    customers waiting at the bar are rarely served in the order in which they arrived. the most reliable method for being served promptly is to stand close to the bar  perhaps leaning gently on it  but not right over it  and smile as often as possible at a bartender of your choice. things that will get you served faster than average are    being attractive  and of the opposite sex to the bar person being tall knowing the bar person   nan  brits always buy drinks in rounds. even if they re with people they don t know  they will buy drinks in rounds. this system  whilst clearly open to abuse  has worked for several hundred years due to a tacit agreement by the entire population concerning certain rules. if drinking with brits  you must adhere to these rules.    even if there is not a chance of you having another one that night  you shouldn t feel guilty about not being able to get a round in. on most evenings  someone will end up slightly out of pocket. perhaps you ll be with the same people drinking every night  perhaps the guy who just bought two rounds in a row will be someone you never see again. the assumption is that over a lifetime these will balance out such that nobody really ends up out of pocket. don t feel bad about accepting drinks from strangers  and don t feel bad about buying them.    the only valid reason anyone may opt out of buying rounds is if they re driving. even then  they may be required to nominally take part in the system with an unwritten agreement that their round won t come up as often as anyone else s. if you re intending only having one drink for reasons other than driving then you must still buy rounds for everyone else. this is your penalty for not drinking.    even if you can find a willing co conspirator  this sort of behaviour is regarded as being out of order. no matter how rich you are  an important part of buying a round involves trying to remember the drinks everyone wanted  squeezing your way to the bar  shouting vainly at the barman  collecting your dripping wet change  trying to squeeze in between the barflies to collect your drinks and then attempting to carry six beers back to the table via some ferrying system without crashing into anyone or spilling them.  
query	160	  kings island play kings corners  if your deck of cards came with jokers  extra cards  or instruction cards  remove them from the deck so there are only the 52 standard cards. shuffle the deck to mix up the cards before dealing.when dealing  deal one card to each player in succession until every player has the right number of cards. always deal in a clockwise direction  starting with the player to the left of the dealer.    turn over the top four cards in the deck and lay them out in a cross pattern on the table with one card each facing north  south  east  and west.if any kings come up  move them to one of the corners  the open spaces left between the four cards of the cross . fill the space left by the king with a new card from the deck  face up like the others.   the piles created by these four  non king  cards are called the foundation piles. place the remainder of the deck in the middle of the four foundation piles.    in kings corners  players hold their cards in their hands  concealed from the other players.  there are many methods you can use to determine who will go first in a game of cards  including    the oldest or youngest person the person whose birthday is soonest the person to the left of the dealer drawing straws rock  paper  scissors    each turn begins with the player drawing a single card from the top of the deck.player one can then begin to discard cards. the object of the game is for each player to try to get rid of all their cards before the other players do.    there are two ways a player can discard. for one  if a player has a king  they can place the king in an empty corner to start a king foundation pile. otherwise  a player can discard cards onto any of the foundation piles on the table    to discard onto any pile  the discarded card must be the opposite color of the top card  and it must be one number smaller.the sequence of cards in the game is king  queen  jack  10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  ace.so  for instance  on a black king  you could only place a red queen. on a red five  you can only place a black four. on a red two  you can place a black ace. when a player discards on top of a foundation pile  make sure the cards overlap so all the cards underneath can still be seen.if the last  or only  card in a foundation pile is an ace  nothing can be played on this card  the pile can only be merged with another pile.  any player  when it s that player s turn  can merge piles on the table if the cards complete the sequence. once a foundation pile has been moved  the player who moved it can fill the empty space with any card or card sequence from their hand.   to merge piles  they must match the red black alternation  and the pile on top must complete the numeric sequence. for instance  if you have a foundation pile containing a six  five  and four  you can place those cards  in that sequence  on top of another foundation pile with a seven as the top card  as long as the seven and six from the separate piles are opposite colors. when a pile is completed and contains all the cards from king to ace  that pile can be shuffled back into the deck in the center.  when player one has discarded all the cards possible  merged any possible piles  and filled the space with any empty cards  it is time for player two to have a turn  followed by any subsequent players  before play returns to the original player.   always remember to pick up one card at the beginning of each turn. player two is to the left of player one  so that the game is played in a clockwise direction. when it s any player s turn  if they cannot discard after drawing from the deck  play passes on to the next player. when the center deck runs out  continue playing without drawing cards.  since the object of the game is to discard all your cards  the game is over as soon as a player is able to discard every card from their hand  including the last card picked up at the beginning of the final turn.    in some versions of the game  players only draw a card if they cannot go  and do not pick up a new card at the beginning of each turn.  kings corners can be played with multiple rounds  so that when one player goes out  penalty points are allotted based on the cards left in the other players  hands  and then another round is played.allot 10 points for every king left in a player s hand and one point for every other card. the game ends once a player reaches or exceeds a certain score  such as 25 or 50 points. when a player does reach or exceed the given score  the player with the fewest points wins.    as another form of keeping score  you can also use poker chips that get paid into a communal pot  and the player who wins each hand wins the pot. in this case  each player would start with the same number of chips  such as 50 each  for instance.to begin every round  each player puts one chip into the pot. if any player has a turn but cannot discard any cards  that player pays another chip into the pot. you can also play so that players have to pay a chip for each card left in their hand at the end of each round  similar to the point system  10 chips for a king and one chip for every other card .

query	163	compare to other african city mombasa grow african violets  the most common way to grow new african violets is to propagate them from the leaves of existing plants. once you do this  you can sprout the cutting in water. to propagate a new african violet in water  you ll need a sterilized cutting tool  a thin necked bottle  such as a sterilized beer bottle   and a plastic bag or wrap.select a large and healthy leaf from a healthy african violet. include 2 inches  5 cm  of stem and cut the leaf from the plant on a 45 degree angle. the cut side of the angle should be on the top of the leaf. fill the bottle with lukewarm water. place the stem of the leaf into the neck of the bottle  so that the stem is in water and the leaf is resting above the rim. cover the leaf and top of the bottle loosely with plastic to help keep in the humidity. place the leaf somewhere warm that gets lots of filtered light. add more water as necessary to keep the stem submerged. over the next several weeks  the cutting will begin to sprout baby african violets.    alternatively  you can also plant that same cutting directly into soil rather than sprouting it in water. to do this you ll need your healthy leaf and 2 inches  5 cm  of stem cut from a healthy violet  a small pot of clear plastic  potting soil  and a plastic cover or wrap.fill the pot with loose potting soil. press the cut stem a half inch  1.3 cm  into the soil. cover the top of the pot with a clear plastic cover or wrap. place the cutting somewhere warm where it will get lots of filtered sun. you probably won t need to water as long as the plastic keeps in the moisture.    one way to grow african violets is to start them from seed  though this is less common than propagating the plants from cuttings. to grow african violets from seeds  you ll need seed starters  a plastic cover or wrap  a spray bottle  growing lights  and a medium suitable for african violets  such as milled coconut and perlite or pasteurized peat moss.water the medium and allow it to dry out so it s moist. fill the seed starters with medium. spray the top of the medium with water. sprinkle a few seeds into the top of each starter cell. cover the top of the cells with plastic. place the seed starters 10 inches  25 cm  below the grow lights. provide the seeds with 12 to 14 hours of light per day. if the environment stays humid thanks to the plastic wrap  you won t need to water.    seedlings should reach a certain size before they re transplanted  but plants sprouted from cuttings will be ready to transplant after a certain amount of time.   for seedlings  wait until the seedlings have leaves that reach 2 inches  5 cm  in width.for cuttings  the babies should be ready in about eight to 10 weeks  once new leaves are roughly the size of a dime.    african violets grow best in a slightly acidic medium that has a ph between 6.4 and 6.9. because the medium must be loose  well draining  and allow for free root development  african violets are not often grown in soil.   most garden and home stores will sell a medium specifically designed for african violets. you can also make your own african violet mix by combining equal parts perlite  vermiculite  and peat moss.  because african violets are grown indoors  choosing the right pot is like choosing the right home for your plants. these plants grow best in pots that are sized for their root systems. don t put your plant in a pot that s too large  otherwise it may not bloom.a good rule of thumb is to put your violet in a pot that s one third the size of the plant itself  because this will match the size of the root system. for the current size of your seedlings or babies  a 2 inch  5 cm  pot will probably be sufficient. you can use either plastic or terracotta pots for your violets. plastic pots require less watering  but terracotta pots provide more air flow.    when you propagate violets by cuttings  you could have as many as 15 babies grow from a single parent. these must be separated before they re planted. gently turn the cutting  along with all the soil  out onto a newspaper or table. carefully remove the soil with your fingers to reveal the cut stem and all the babies.to distinguish one baby from another  look for small clusters of leaves that are attached to the parent. when you ve located all the babies  carefully trim each one from the parent using a sterilized cutting tool.    fill your small pots with your african violet medium. leave the medium loose  and don t pack it down.with the tip of your pinky finger or a pencil  make a half inch  1.3 cm  indentation in the soil at the center of each pot.   gently place each seedling or baby plant into the hole in the soil. make sure all the leaves and stems are above the soil. loosely cover the roots with extra medium.    add some water to each pot so that the medium is moist. place the pots with the new plants in a location that s warm  gets lots of indirect sun  and that s humid.   if you don t have a humid location available  set up a humidifier where the plants are growing.    african violets thrive best when their soil is somewhere between dry and moist  so give them water when the soil starts feeling dry to the touch. over or underwatering the violets could prevent the plant from blooming.   use room temperature water rather than cold water  otherwise you could chill the roots. if this happens  the leaves or flowers may start to curl. don t get water on the leaves or flowers  as this can lead to rings or spots forming on the plant.if you get water on the leaves or flowers  gently dry the area with an absorbent towel.    african violets need lots of light  and they won t flower if they don t get enough sun. however  they will scorch easily in direct sunlight  so their placement in the house is very important.   in winter  the plants will do best near a window that faces south or west in the northern hemisphere  or north or east in the southern hemisphere.in summer  the plants will be better near a window that faces north or east in the northern hemisphere  or south or west in the southern hemisphere. to provide bright and indirect sunlight  provide shade by placing the plants behind lightweight curtains.    these plants need lots of nutrients to continue producing flowers year round  and the best way to ensure they get what they need is to provide them with fertilizer.   there are specific fertilizers available for african violets  but the important thing is to provide them with balanced nutrients. a good fertilizer would be a 20 20 20  which means it has equal quantities of nitrogen  phosphorous  and potassium.follow the manufacturer s instructions for feeding the violets.    the best temperature range for african violets is between 65 and 75 f  18 and 24 c . keep them in an area where you can maintain this temperature  and keep them away from drafts and other things that could cause sudden temperature fluctuations.anything below 50 f  10 c  will almost certainly kill the plant.    the ideal humidity level for african violets is between 40 and 60 percent. you can monitor this with a hygrometer. to add more humidity to the air  consider installing a portable humidifier in the room where the violets are kept.   violets that don t get enough humidity will grow slowly  and while they will produce flower buds  they likely won t bloom.  because african violets thrive in small pots  it s important to repot them regularly to keep up with their growth. when you repot  make sure you use new soil  and a pot that s one size larger than the pot they re currently in.

months prior  at this point you must be physically and mentally conditioned. regularly take multivitamin tablets and small amounts of iron supplements. iron helps your blood cells carry oxygen  but too much is unhealthy. maintain a healthy diet and increase your aerobic workouts to an hour. continuing practising climbing  but make it harder such as sprinting up steep hills. try to get an opportunity to go camping so you can improve your skills. two months prior  maintain your routines. increase the length of aerobic workouts. improve your endurance. rather than focusing on how heavy you can lift  tone down the weight and see how many reps you can do in a minute. get out in the wilderness and test out your gear. remember to maintain a healthy diet and drink lots of water.    to climb mount everest you will need to understand mountaineering  climbing and navigational skills. taking outdoor and navigational classes will help you. your everest expedition guide will also help you prepare for the mountain. have a good understanding of bushwhacking  rope handling  river crossings  belaying and tying knots  rappelling  navigation  crevasse and rock rescue skills. merely taking care of urinating and bowel movements requires special techniques and extreme care in the low temperatures.    the most common ways of dying on the mountain are fatigue  ice falls  lack of oxygen  high altitudes  harsh weather conditions and frostbite. learn from the mistakes made by other climbers and understand the symptoms of altitude sickness  and its prevention techniques and emergency treatments.    above 8 000 metres  26 000 ft  you will face significant challenges to survival. any body part exposed will suffer frostbite. the temperature is so low that the ice is an extreme slipping hazard. the oxygen level is only 337 mbar  a third of the requirement normally needed to breathe. the conditions are so harsh it takes most climbers up to 12 hours to walk the distance of 1.72 kilometres  1 mile  from south col to the summit. to live in the death zone you will need about 50 days of altitude acclimatization for a typical expedition  otherwise you will lose consciousness in minutes.   since helicopters can t easily reach the summit  if you become unable to walk you will be left to die. it is not uncommon to come across dead bodies in the mountain.    even if you think you know everything  you probably don t. have at least 3 years of mountaineering experience. practise climbing other mountains that have high altitudes and extreme temperatures.    most expedition companies take groups of around 10 people with numerous sherpas and several travel guides. the tour company will take care of your climbing permits and oxygen supplies. sherpas are native to the himalayan mountains of nepal who will carry your food  load and equipment. they can also offer you support and help climbing the mountain. expect to pay at least  60 000 for the expedition.   paying for a budget tour or not using a company at all puts your life more at risk. generally the more you pay  the safer your climb will be. hundreds of climbers who paid minimal prices have died.    you will need to ask your expedition company for a list of equipment you will need bring. you will need mountaineering equipment such as ice axes and crampons  clothing such as gloves and headwear  and supplies such as food  a stove to thaw water and the food  and first aid materials.    allow 6 to 8 days to complete the walk. the time consuming walk is beneficial as it will help you get used to the high altitudes. this camp is 5 380 m  17 700 ft . it is typical to spend a few days at the base camp to get used to the low oxygen levels so you will avoid altitude sickness. during your stay sherpas will prepare ropes and ladders for the next part of your journey.    the icefall is a moving glacier mass of tumbled ice with deep crevasses. it is best to start before dawn so that the freezing temperatures will weld the ice tightly together. proceed to camp i which is at an altitude of 6 065 m  19 900 ft .    the most direct route is gashed by deep ice and massive crevasses. the western cwm is a flat  gently rising glacial valley. you will arrive at the base of lhotse face at camp ii or advanced base camp  abc  which is at an elevation of 6 500 m  21 000 ft .    this face is icy  so  you will need to use the fixed ropes which are permanently in place. they interlink so that you are constantly connected to a rope. the steep slopes of up to 50 degrees and hard ice make it easy for your crampons to slip. camp iii is at an altitude of 7 470 m  24 500 ft .    the spur is a big  black rib or rock followed by hard yellow rock known as the yellow band. it was named by the 1952 swiss expedition. there are fixed ropes to guide you in place. camp iv  high camp  is on the south col which has an altitude of 7 920 m  26 000 ft .    you will need to wait for clear weather and low winds  otherwise you will have to descend  many meters back to base camp. the final section of climbing to the top includes walking up a series or steps made from rock and walking along a knife edged ridge to a 12 m  40 ft  wall called hillary step. climb up the snow slope and you will reach the top of the summit which is highest point on earth at 8 848 m  29 029 ft .    the route to the advanced base camp  abc  is 22 km  12 miles  is rugged and has lots of boulders  ice and snow. the path follows rongbuk glacier and then merges into eastern rongbuk glacier. the abc camp is 6 400m  21 300 ft .    when you reach the east rongbuk glacier you will have to use crampons for the first time. after a short walk you can attach yourself to a fixed rope. this part gains significant altitude and some parts will feel vertical. it takes about 5 hours to reach the north col  camp i  which is at an elevation of 7 000 m  23 000 ft .    this section is known as the high camps. the path is mostly snow with some rocks. this section is known for strong winds which prevail in the area. it takes about 4 hours to reach camp ii which is at an altitude of 7 500 m  24 750 ft . many climbers use this camp for acclimatization purposes.    many climbers skip this camp and go directly to camp iv. camp iii is at an altitude of 7 900 m  25 600 ft . most climbers will need to sleep with supplemental oxygen. the route to the camp is extremely windy which means it can take you up to 6 hours to complete  however once you reach the camp you are protected by the north face of the mountain. the camp is built on small rock ledges since there is not many open spaces on this part of the mountain.    follow the fixed rope through the snow filled gully. then take the small ramp to the northeast ridge which is just under the camp. you do not want to spend a lot of time at the camp  it is basically just a rest stop. camp iv is at an altitude of 8 300 m  27 390 ft .    to get to the summit you will have to pass three rock features  called three steps. the first step requires hard pulling on fixed ropes to get over the mushroom shaped rock. it is full of loose rock which is hard to walk over. the second step  the chinese ladder is most intense. you will need to climb over a thick ice slab to climb on a vertical ladder with a 3 000 m  10 000 ft  drop. the third step is a straightforward rock climb  however under the extreme conditions it is very challenging.    along the final stretch it is extremely cold  steep and windy. towards the top of the pyramid there are more small rocks which are challenging to get over. the summit ridge is very exposed and has steep slope angles of up to 60 degrees. it has drop offs on both sides of 3 000 m  10 000 ft . at the end of the ridge you will reach the highest point on earth at 8 848 m  29 029 ft .  
query	165	see local laws and customs north korea spot the north star  ursa major is a constellation that is also called  big bear    the big dipper   or  plough . the two outermost stars in the cup of the  dipper   or the  blade  of the plough  are called the  pointers  because they describe a straight line that points to the north star  see figure .    the big dipper is comprised of seven stars that are very recognizable in the night sky.the seven stars compose a shape that looks like a cup with a handle.   to make it easier to find ursa major  try using a constellation map if one is available. you can also download a constellation finding app on your devices  like skyviewfor apple devices or skymapfor androids . also try looking on a clear night. the absence of clouds will make it easier to spot the star groupings.    ursa major rotates in the sky  so its position depends on the time of your at which you are viewing it. it always rotates around the north star.so  sometimes the cup is facing up  while other times the cup faces down or to the side.   remember that the big dipper is a fixture of the northern hemisphere s sky. so you will only be able to see it and follow these guidelines if you are in the northern hemisphere. here are some seasonal guidelines for finding the big dipper based on its location at midnight   in the spring  the big dipper is located to the north of the north star  polaris  with the cup facing downward. in the summer  the big dipper is located just west of polaris with the cup facing to the right. in the fall  the big dipper is situated to the south of polaris with the cup facing upright. in the winter  the big dipper can be found to the east of polaris with the cup facing towards the left.      latitude is the position north or south of the equator. the height of the north star above the horizon is equal to the latitude of the observer. it cannot be seen by an observer on or below the equator although  as a practical matter  it will be too close to the horizon to be observed south of 10 degrees of north latitude.   for reference  here are some latitudinal measurements of some major locations in the northern hemisphere   the north pole has a latitude of 90 degrees north.reykjavik  iceland has a latitude of 70 degrees north. juneau  alaska and edinburgh  scotland have a latitude of 60 degrees north. seattle  washington  new york city  and venice  italy have a latitude of 50 degrees north. denver  colorado and seoul  south korea have a latitude of 40 degrees north. new orleans  louisiana and orlando  florida have a latitude of 30 degrees north. mexico city  mexico and kingston  jamaica have a latitude of 20 degrees north. san jose  costa rica and panama city  panama have a latitude of 10 degrees north.   if you have access to the internet  you can use a latitude finder online to determine your latitude  like the one offered by nasa.if you don t know your latitude and you don t have access to the internet  you can determine your latitude by looking at the sun at noon.put one flat board or stick in the ground pointing upwards so that it is perfectly perpendicular with the ground. use another flat board on the top  making a t with the two boards   but tilt the top board toward the sun. the angle of the shadow cast by the sun will be the degree of your latitude. note that these readings are only accurate on march 21st and september 21st  the spring and fall equinoxes . in the winter  specifically december 21st  you should subtract 23.45 degrees from your reading and in the summer  specifically june 21st  you should add 23.45 degrees. these variations in measurement exist because of the way the earth is tilted when it orbits the sun.   if you know your location in terms of degrees of latitude  face north and look for a moderately bright star that many degrees above the horizon. a fist held out at arm s length represents approximately 10 degrees in the sky and can be used to measure the height above the horizon.  the two outer most stars in the  cup  of the big dipper  the two farthest from the  handle   are the keys to finding the north star.   draw an imaginary line straight through these two stars toward the little dipper. this will lead you to the handle of the little dipper. the brightest star at the end of the handle of the little dipper is the north star.the north star  polaris  or sometimes dhruva tara  fixed star   taivaanneula  heaven s needle   or lodestar  is a second magnitude multiple star about 430 light years from earth. because it is very close to the north celestial pole  it appears stationary over the northern horizon.  the constellation of cassiopeia  which looks like a big  w   is always opposite ursa major. the north star is located approximately midway between the central star of cassiopeia and ursa major.this trick is especially helpful in the fall when it is harder to see the big dipper.  the north star is more reliable than a compass  which can be affected by environmental factors and periodic variations. if you can find north by locating the north star and your compass tells you something different  follow the direction the north star leads you.  where the north star appears in the sky depends on your latitude. at the north pole  the north star appears directly overhead  but at the equator  it would appear on the horizon   both corresponding to the latitudes of the location.if you use the  fist  method and count how many  fists  the north star appears over the horizon  that will give you your latitude. remember that a  fist  counts as approximately 10 degrees for latitude.    use the north star to guide you in a direction  or at the very least  to keep you from going in circles if you are lost. think about where you are and which direction would be the most helpful  especially if you are lost in the wilderness and need to get back to civilization.   once you have found the north star  facing it will point you due north. if you face directly away from it  you ll be facing due south.when you are facing the north star  stretch your arms out to your sides. your left hand will be pointing due west and your right hand will be pointing due east.

query	167	book vacation punta cana travel to antarctica  by far the most common way to travel to antarctica is on a special cruise ship. these trips vary  but are typically between 10 days and three weeks long.you can take various routes to the peninsula depending on where you are departing from. the advantages of these cruises are that everything is provided on the ship  and you get to see antarctica and its wildlife close up for an extended period of time.   most voyages to the antarctic peninsular region leave from ushuaia  tierra del fuego in argentina  port stanley in the falkland islands and a few leave from punta arenas in chile  buenos aires in argentina  or puerto madryn in argentina.    there are a variety of ship sizes that you can travel on  ranging from around 45 passengers total at the smaller end  to 280 passengers at the larger end. both have their advantages and disadvantages. in general  the larger the ship the more comfortable and well equipped it will be  but the less opportunity you will get to land on antarctica yourself and see things up close.   in high seas  larger ships are the most comfortable but the strict guidelines on how many people can visit the shore will limit your opportunities for shore visits. smaller ships allow for more time on shore. this is because tourist guidelines limit landings of tour groups to 100 people.all reputable cruise operators will be registered with the international association of antarctica tour operators  iaato   so this is good place to consult during your planning. they support environmentally friendly travel to antarctica.the costs for these cruises will vary  but for a ten day trip expect to pay at least  4500  whereas for the longer trips it could be from  12 750  16 000.  it is possible to reach antarctica by yacht but this is not commonplace and is more for specialist yachtsmen than your average tourist. there are a number of yachting companies that are sanctioned by the iaato and conduct trips to antarctica who can you contact.yachts tend to leave from ushuaia or stanley and are only for the very courageous and adventurous.   for these smaller ships  the conditions are much more treacherous than the larger cruise ships.this is a very expensive option that could cost more than  1000 a day for each traveller.  one left field option is to travel on a french re supply vessel as a tourist. the ship  marion dufresne ii  leaves from r union and the round trip takes around a month.the number of tourists allowed aboard is limited and you will have to contact french tourist agencies for up to date information on departure schedules  availability and prices.prices start from around  8 000 for the month.  probably the most straight forward way to see antarctica is from above. you can book yourself on a sightseeing flight over antarctica which enables you to see its great white landscape from the comfort of a plane. taking a sightseeing flight is a good option for day trippers who want to spend a few hours over antarctica and get back the same day. you can enjoy the views while antarctica experts give talks on the plane and you are served food and drink.australia is now the only place you can take these flights from.you need to plan ahead if you want to do this and book early. if you want to get up and close and see the wildlife this is not the choice for you. depending on your seats  tickets will cost anything from  1 000 to  8 000.  if you want to touch down on antarctica  there are a number of companies that offer this service  leaving from a variety of places. where you choose to go from will depend on the rest of your trip  so think about whether it would be better to travel from australia  chile  south africa or argentina and fully investigate the schedules from each place. bear in mind that flights to antarctica are much less frequent and less predictable than ordinary flights.some adventure holiday companies have deals which involve landing on antarctica and skiing  camping and climbing.you can fly to king george island from punta arenas in chile and stay overnight at a camp there for tourists.  another option is a fly cruise package  which cuts down the time spent on a ship  avoiding the notoriously rough drake passage   but still enables you to get a close up view of the landscape and wildlife. you can fly to king george island  and then get aboard a ship which will take you around the area..   this could be a good option if you want to see the ice and wildlife up close  but don t want to spend so much time travelling on board a cruise ship. but it won t be any cheaper. expect to pay something in the region of  10 000 to  14 000 for a two week trip.  be aware that flights are subject to cancellations due to weather and other safety issues. this is true for any flight  but the extreme conditions on the bottom of the world make this a more frequent occurrence. the best approach to assessing flight options is to read guidebooks written specifically for antarctica  or check specialist websites  as the details change yearly depending on availability and interest.    antarctica s tour season covers about five months  mostly over the southern hemisphere summer  november to march .all other times of the year are extremely cold  dark  and the pack ice freezes out a long way. be aware that while there will be less people around later in the season  much of the wildlife will already have left and headed out to sea. during these months  some of the things you can expect include    during november  the pack ice starts to break up and it s mating season for the penguins and other birds. during december and january  the penguin chicks hatch and are fed and nurtured in the breeding grounds. during february and march  the penguin chicks fledge  the adult penguins molt  and the whales are easy to spot.  this is one travel destination where budget travel is not much of an option unless you re hired to work hard. at a minimum  you will probably be facing at least us 5 000 and that is for the bare necessities and not necessarily the best seating or opportunities.   it is possible to get cheap last minute deals with cruise ships in places like ushuaia in argentina. you need to be in town  flexible  and able to set off straight away. this is a risky option  but if it works you could save quite a lot of money.if you don t want to visit as a tourist  think of other options  such as joining a government expedition to antarctica. for this  you ll likely need suitable technical  scientific  medical  or other relevant skills like cooking for a large group. you will also need to be considered to have a suitable background for government employment.another possibility is to travel as an invited part of a crew. some people get asked to come along as journalists  photographers  artists  etc.  and their trip is covered by whoever invited or sent them along. again  this will depend on your skills.    the antarctic environment is dangerous for human beings. the weather can deteriorate rapidly and it is always cold  even in the summertime  highs in the summer along the coast generally range from 41 56 f . there are dangers such as crevasses on ice fields and glaciers and fire hazards are high in the very dry environment  so handling anything flammable must be done with care.   read up on the gear and clothing you need. you will definitely need excellent waterproof clothing  your cruise ship will most likely have things to hire if you don t have them  but they might not be a great fit.there are no vaccination requirements for antarctica but you should be fit and in good health because medical treatment will be basic and spread thin among all your passengers. any medical conditions that you do have should be detailed by your doctor in letter form  especially if you need to bring along medication.    the antarctic environment is fragile and apart from expeditions  bases  and some tourists  there has been little human change. wildlife remains unafraid of humans because of the lack of long term negative interaction. it is important to respect the pristine nature of antarctica and to ensure that tourism doesn t have a negative impact. there are visitor guidelines adopted under the antarctic treaty that regulate visitors  actions at antarctica and it is worth reading them as part of your preparation for the visit. some of the basics to keep in mind include    don t go too near wildlife and don t do anything to disturb wildlife. don t litter. don t deface anything   all human built structures have historical value and many huts  etc.  have heritage listings. do not engrave anything into rocks or other land features.  take

query	176	take deliveries west indies make good tips delivering pizza  you should be polite and friendly to all your customers  even if they are rude or don t tip you well. always smile and have a positive attitude  even if you are having a bad day. customers will be more likely to tip you well if you show professionalism regardless of what s going on in your personal life or back at the pizza shop.  before making your delivery  look at the name on the order. when the customer opens the door  say something like  good evening  mr. smith. i ve got your pizza right here  and the total comes to  29.76. if you re unsure how to pronounce the customer s name  skip it. instead  say  how are you tonight   or something similar.    people love their pets  and they ll like you more if you re nice to their pets too. compliment the pet by saying something like  what a handsome german shepherd you have here   or ask if you can pet them.  rather than leaving your customer to wonder what happened to their pizza  let them know what s going on. if it s a busy night  or you are having car trouble  call and let the customer know you ll be late. they may still be annoyed  but you re likely to get a better tip for being upfront and honest than for just being late.  you should always thank the customer  regardless of their attitude or the tip. say something like  thanks for choosing abc pizza  we truly appreciate your business   customers like to know they are appreciated  so recognizing their business can help you get a better tip.  customers will appreciate it if you acknowledge mistakes and apologize for them. do your best to fix the problem  and offer a discount or free item  if your employer allows it.    make sure the pizza was made correctly and that you have everything the customer ordered. they will be frustrated and less likely to tip you if you forgot those extra containers of ranch dressing  or brought them super spicy hot wings when they ordered barbeque flavor wings.  it s incredibly important that you get to your deliveries promptly. if your car battery is constantly dying  or you break down on the side of the road often  that will severely reduce your tips. make sure you have a reliable vehicle to do your deliveries with  because being late will not help you earn good money.  spend some time looking at a map  or even driving around to get a feel for the area. you need to know all of the major roads in your city  and what separates your city into northern  southern  eastern  and western sections. you ll make better time if you know the difference between 500 west maple and 500 east maple.  many people have gps or can get directions using their cell phone. if this doesn t apply to you  invest in a gps system for your car. it will be super helpful if you get lost or if a customer lives in the middle of nowhere. using gps can also help you find the most efficient route from one delivery to the next.  customers may ask questions about their order or future orders  so be sure you know the menu. they will appreciate you being able to tell them what s on the  super supreme  when they ask.  customers will need a pen to add a tip and sign the receipt if they paid with a credit card. not having a working pen with you tells the customer you are unprepared. be sure to keep a few spares in your car  and one in the delivery bag or in your pocket.  you ll get better tips if you look presentable. wear clothes without stains or rips  if possible  and make sure your hair is neat. some guys even say they get better tips when they are clean shaven  so you could consider getting rid of your beard if you re not too attached to it.  make an  x  or an arrow that points to all three lines on the receipt  total  tip  and signature . highlighting just the tip line is tacky  but pointing out all three may make a customer more likely to fill in that tip line rather than leave it blank.  rather than giving a five dollar bill back when someone hands you  20 and their total was  15  give them back five ones. this way  they ll be more likely to give you a couple bucks  rather than stuffing that  5 back in their pocket.  some people add a tip to the bill on a credit card at the time they order. though it may be tempting to leave this order for last  since you know you ve already bagged a tip  don t do that. give them the respect they deserve and deliver their pizza promptly. they ll remember your effort  and will be more likely to tip you well the next time  too.  some people order pizza often and may have tipped you well in the past. try to remember these customers  and treat them well. ask how they are doing  or suggest new menu items you think they may like. a little extra effort can go a long way to ensuring you always receive a good tip from these customers.  while you may not be able to offer discounts or give out free pizza or sodas  you can offer extra items. bring extra napkins  plates  or seasonings  such as red peppers or parmesan cheese. offering these to your customers when you arrive shows them that you are prepared and that you care about their order and experience.
query	177	make lager make lemon beer  there is a reason why many styles of mild wheat beer  such as german hefeweizens and belgian wits  are served with a lemon wedge in the glass. the bright  lively citrus notes pair excellently with the smooth  earthy flavor of wheat beer.    lemon also pairs excellently with light lager style beers like pilsner and pale american lagers. in fact  a popular summer cocktail called a shandy takes advantage of this very pairing by combining pale lager beer and lemonade.    while this combination is not as popular  you may also find that lemon works well with rich  flavorful beers like stout  porter  and ipa. lemon could provide an energetic lift to the heavy chocolate notes of a stout  while lemon might also blend harmoniously with the grapefruit notes of a hoppy ipa.    the most straightforward way to brew lemon beer is to add a small amount of lemon juice to the beer during secondary fermentation. some of the sugars in the lemon juice will undergo fermentation  which will add complexity to the beer. however  the basic brightness of the lemon will remain present in the beer s finished flavor.    an option for adding more subtle lemon flavor to your beer is to steep lemon peel in the secondary fermenter. the lemon peel contains the fruit s essential oils  which are very flavorful and will not be metabolized by the yeast. you can also steep complementary spices in the secondary fermenter  such as clove or cinnamon.    a third option for making lemon beer is to use a prepared product such as lemon jam. the flavor in these products is often more concentrated than in lemon juice  and it won t tend to dissipate so much between fermentation and consumption. note that the sugar present in jams and jellies will increase the gravity of your beer.    of course  a simple way to make sure the lemon tastes as fresh as possible in your beer is to add it to your glass just before drinking. adding a lemon wedge to your beer glass can be an easy way to improve its presentation or even to test a beer recipe for the possible addition of lemon during fermentation.   nan

query	179	cook beetroot make beetroot juice  using a sharp  serrated knife  cut the greens off the top of the beetroot. trim about 1 4 inch  6 mm  from the root end of the beet  as well.   you can technically juice the top greens with the beetroot  but it s more common to prepare the juice with only the beetroot. if you do choose to include the greens  however  rinse them under running water and chop them into lengths measuring 2 inches  5 cm  or smaller. juice them alongside the prepared beetroot.    rinse the beetroots under cool  running water. use a vegetable brush to scrub off any dirt you cannot scrape away with your fingers.   beetroot skin contains plenty of nutrients  so if it s relatively thin  you should clean the skin and leave it intact for the juice. on the other hand  if the skin seems notably tough or dirty  you can peel the beetroot using a vegetable peeler or paring knife before continuing further.    cut the beetroots in half  then cut each portion in half again.if the pieces are too large for the appliance  you could burn out the motor. most juicers  blenders  and foot processors can handle quartered beetroot  but if you have a low powered appliance or an older model  you may need to cut each quarter in half.    place the collection pitcher beneath the pour spout of the juicer.   if you have a model that does not come with its own collection pitcher  place a bowl or large glass beneath the spout before continuing.    place one chunk of beetroot into the feed chute. use the appliance s plunger to gently push the beetroot through the machine.

soon as one beetroot piece passes through the juicer  start feeding the next chunk through. continue until the entire prepare beet has been juiced.    pour the collected beetroot juice into a serving glass. drink it immediately or chill it for 30 minutes before enjoying.   you can store beetroot juice in the refrigerator for a day or two  but the flavor is best when enjoyed immediately or shortly thereafter.    place the beetroot chunks and water in a high powered blender or food processor.   since beetroots are such hard vegetables  most blenders will have difficulty processing them dry. adding a splash of water should help the appliance move more smoothly at the beginning of the process.    puree the beetroots with the water on high speed. continue until you no longer notice any

the juice through the cloth and into the bowl beneath.   follow the same procedure if you use a jelly bag. if you use a fine mesh strainer  use a rubber spatula to press down on the pulp  squeezing as much juice out as possible. note that you should wear a pair of food grade rubber or plastic gloves while working with the beet pulp. otherwise  the beetroot juice will stain your hands red.

carrot. peel away the thin outer skin  rinse the carrots under running water  and cut each one into 2 inch  5 cm  chunks.    process the solid ingredients through the juicer as though you were preparing basic beetroot juice. do not add the apple juice.   feed the apple through first  followed by the carrot and the beetroot. finish by feeding the ginger through. use a spoon to quickly stir

query	182	play chess on internet  chess play solo chess  solo chess is not a rapid game it is a slow moving logic battle against yourself. since the game will be played over the course of a few days or weeks  set up the board in a convenient location that others will not disturb. place all of the pieces in their respective positions.   the back row of pieces is ordered from left to right as follows  rook  knight  bishop  queen  king  bishop  knight  rook. the white queen must be placed on a white square  the black queen must be placed on a black square. the front row of pieces contains eight pawns.    over the course of your solo game  you may find it difficult to keep track of whose turn it is. a small token  such as a coin or figurine  can help you keep track. throughout the game  move the token from side to side to signify whose turn it is.   you can also just turn the entire board around so that you look at the board from the other side.    when you play yourself in chess  you are always aware of what your opponent you is thinking. it is tempting to use this advantage to skew the game towards one side or the other. doing so  however  is not beneficial to your development as a player. in order to improve your skills through solo chess  you must remain indifferent about what side wins the game. master chess players  while aware of their opponent s strategy  always strive to make the best move possible.  just as in traditional chess  the player with the white pieces always opens the game. select a white pawn to move forward one to two spaces. switch sides and select a black pawn to move forward one to two spaces.   try to avoid mirroring moves. players generally move one of the pawns in front of the king or queen. this opens up a lane for the queen and bishops.  prior to moving your pieces  always pause for a moment to think.   ask yourself several questions about your opponent s strategy.  what is my opponent doing    how did my opponent s last move impact the game    is my opponent trying to set a trap   after assessing the situation  formulate or adjust your strategy. first  search for moves that will threaten your opponent s king or lead to the capture of one of their pieces. second  determine if the move you want to make will leave your pieces vulnerable to capture. lastly  double check your evaluation.  throughout the opening portion of the game  you want to position your pieces for future attacks. prior to moving either queen  work to move the knights and bishops towards the center of the board. doing so will put the knights and bishops in a position to attack your opponent s pieces. avoid moving too many of your pawns in an effort to capture the other player s pawns.  castling is often the last action of your opening game. it is a move that relocates your king to a position of relative safety. in order to castle  all of the spaces between your unmoved king and an unmoved rook must be open. slide your king two spaces towards the unmoved rook. place the rook behind the king  between the king s starting square and his new position .   if your opponent fails to castle  look for an opportunity to capture their king.  the middlegame is devoted to strategically attacking your opponent. during this portion of the game  you must remain patient and aware of your opponent s strategy. if your opponent fails to protect a piece  consider seizing the opportunity to capture it. before you capture the piece    make sure you are not falling into a trap. examine how the move will impact your pieces and the safety of your king.  during the middlegame  you and your opponent will inevitably capture each other s pieces. essentially  you will be swapping pieces with your opponent. while some swaps will be necessary and logical  others may be detrimental to the strength of your men and the safety of your king. before swapping pieces  consider if the piece you are capturing is as valuable as the piece you are sacrificing.   the queen is the most valuable piece  followed by the rooks. the bishops and knights are of equal value. pawns have the least value to you.  once the manpower of each side has diminished  the endgame begins. manipulate your pieces so that they threaten the safety of your opponent s king. the goal of the endgame is to checkmate your opponent before they can checkmate you. when a king can not outrun a threat to its safety and the remaining men can not thwart the threat  the king is in check.

access to this type of copper  save it up until you get at least 10 pounds or more and then melt it down into nuggets before trying to sell it.to melt copper dust  turnings or scraps  you will need materials specifically made for melting and casting metals. the melting point of copper is 1 981 degrees fahrenheit so you need a kiln or furnace that can withstand that kind of heat. a potter s kiln can get hot enough to melt copper  but the oxidation process required to maintain that kind of heat will burn away a lot of the copper. also  it will heavily contaminate the kiln. look for bronze foundry casting tools and an electric or propane furnace made specifically for melting copper and other non ferrous metals.artists often melt brass and copper for sculpture  and many have posted detailed tutorials for building a homemade furnace. visit the foundry handbook for an example of a detailed tutorial for a diy furnace using an oxy acetylene torch for welding and a disposable helium tank or empty freon tank.be aware  however  that the cost of powering the furnace with propane or electric will eat up about half the value of the copper. therefore  it might not be worth investing in this process unless you have a steady  reliable source of a great deal of copper non solids.exercise caution when melting metal. for your safety  have safety gear such as protection goggles or face shield  dark welding goggles  oven gloves  a large flat iron pan to put the mold on  and running cold water.  while copper wire can technically be segregated into five grades  most scrap yards classify all wire as either high grade or low grade copper wire. high grade wire has a single layer of insulation  and low grade has a double layer. the five grades of copper wire range from 85 percent to 10 percent.85  wire is a thin wire with a diameter close to that of a pencil. 70  wire can generally be found inside electronics or appliances. an example is romex machine wire without any attachments. 50  wire is found in extension cords and appliance cords. 35  wire is thinly gauged wire with many attachments. this wire is generally used for communications in vga cables or telephone wires. 10  wire can be found in christmas lights.    copper breakage is anything with copper winding.transformers  motors  alternators and magnetrons are all examples of copper breakage.disassemble parts to separate the copper from the steel in order to get the best price for the copper. otherwise the scrap yard will lump the less valuable steel and copper together and you won t get as much.  common copper alloys are brass and bronze. technically  bronze is an alloy of copper and tin  and brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. but scrap yards lump them together and sell them at the same price. they refer to them both scrap copper alloys.  before bringing your copper to the scrap yard  first sort your copper yourself into its three different grades. sort tubing and wire into their different categories. this will give you an approximate idea of the overall value of your scrap copper. unsorted and uncategorized lots of copper tend to sell for lower prices.  before purchasing an expensive wire stripper  decide if you are going to be selling enough copper wire on a regular basis to make the investment worthwhile. a general rule of thumb is that if you are stripping more than 1 000 pounds of wire per month  then you should purchase an electric wire stripper.if you are stripping less than 1 000 pounds per month  you do not need to invest in a wire stripper. if you decide not to buy a wire stripper  warm the wire first. place it in the oven on low or put it inside a black box and leave it in the sun. this makes the insulation softer and easier to remove with a handheld stripping tool. never under any circumstances should you burn the insulation off the wire.    scrap yards will not purchase dust or turnings. many sellers don t even bother saving these because they are not valuable. if you have these materials  consider saving them until you have at least 10 pounds and then melting them down into nuggets with an electric or propane furnace made specifically for melting copper and other non ferrous metals. a scrap yard may give you something for the nuggets  but be prepared to accept a price of up to 75 percent below market value for copper. it might not be worth the cost of the electricity or propane to run the furnace.if you do decide to melt down copper dust and trimmings to sell it  invest in the right materials for melting copper. copper melts at a temperature of 1 981 degrees fahrenheit. purchase metal casting materials that are specifically designed to withstand this kind of heat and melt copper and other non ferrous metals. typically  artists use these materials for casting bronze or copper sculpture. you can find a furnace and other materials for melting copper at a bronze foundry. or  you can use an artist s tutorial  such as this one to build a furnace yourself.exercise caution. equip yourself with safety gear such as googles  face masks  oven gloves and running water. if using a homemade furnace  carefully check all gas couplings for leaks. keep all flammable materials a safe distance away from the furnace.be environmentally conscious when melting metals. use as much exhaust to heat the flame as possible so you are not wasting gas or electricity. dispose of any waste from the process at a recycling center for hazardous materials.  some scrap yards will purchase transformers and motors that contain copper at a special  breakage  price. but you should take them apart and separate the copper to get the best value.when taking apart transformers  don t bother trying to cut the steel because it is too hard. instead  cut the copper. it is softer and more malleable.try heating transformers in a bucket over a fire for 20 to 30 minutes. after heating  fill the bucket with ice water. the transformers will become very weak from the sudden change in temperature and be much easier to take apart.exercise safety precautions. wear safety goggles to protect your eyes. wear heat resistant gloves to protect your hands. handle hot pieces with tongs to avoid having to touch them.    check commodity trading prices on nasdaq or cnbc.com to find the latest price for high grade copper. other trade service websites  such as specialty metal sites or investment sites  list the daily prices for metals including copper.prices for commodities  including copper  are affected by market forces and change every day. between 2004 and 2009  copper surged in value from approximately  1 per pound to close to  4 per pound. the value dipped dramatically in 2009 during the recession to approximately  1.50 per pound. but the price rebounded by 2012 to an all time high of approximately  4.50 per pound. since then  the price of copper has decreased. as of september  2015  the price of copper per pound is about  2.43 per pound.  consult a website like 1 800 got scrap  recycler finder or iscrap. these websites let you search by location and by material you have to sell. they also tell you the price the yard is offering for scrap.   you can also find local scrap yards by looking in the phone book or doing a search on the internet. call ahead to find out the price they are offering. look for a scrap yard with a good reputation for customer service. some scrap yard owners may try to take advantage of you. find someone whom you can trust and with whom you can see yourself doing more business.  if you have done your research about the current value of copper  this will help you assess whether the scrap yard is offering a fair price. call several scrap yards and find the one with the best price. try negotiating with them if you can to get the best price. if they won t offer you a fair price  look elsewhere.   some scrap yards will come to you to pick up your scrap. but they may charge you for the service. compare what they are charging you with the cost of delivering it yourself  which includes your time and gas. decide if having it picked up is worth the price.  if you decide to deliver it yourself  you can use whatever vehicle you choose. however  if you are going to be delivering lots of heavy loads  consider using a sturdy pickup truck. a pickup bed allows easy unloading. if you haul your copper in a closed vehicle like a car or suv  it might be more difficult to unload.  many scrap yards weigh your fully loaded vehicle when you arrive. they use a large  accurate  pressure sensitive plate to weigh your vehicle. after unloading the copper  they weigh your vehicle again. the difference is the weight of your scrap.  since copper is a non ferrous material  the yard cannot use a mag crane to remove it from your truck. other ferrous materials like iron and steel can be removed from truck beds by the magnet on the mag crane. but since copper is not magnetic  the scrap yard will likely use a forklift instead.  since copper theft has become such a problem  the government now requires the use of security systems to try to catch copper thieves. when you sell copper at a scrap yard  you will likely be required to register in a database that links a photo and a description of the copper you sold with your personal information. in addition  your thumbprint is recorded. authorities can review these records to link sellers to reported copper thefts.  some scrap yards may pay you with cash. however  if the scrap yard is participating in the government s security database system  they may be prohibited from paying you in cash. in this case  they will likely have an automated teller machine that pays you. the scrap yard will give you a slip of paper with the specified payment. you can input this into the automated teller machine  and it will give you your cash.  most people who sell scrap copper don t rely on finding it by chance. they have sources on which they rely to find a steady supply of copper to sell. for example  you might be able to set up an agreement with an appliance repair store to pick up damaged goods you know contain copper. they might be happy to allow you to recycle what would otherwise wind up in a landfill.  cut wires off the outside. wire can be snipped off of tv s and monitors with scissors. cut off the plugs from the end to add to your brass pile. the small black boxes on charging cables can be cut off and put in your transformer pile. search inside for insulated wires and connectors.thinner insulated copper wires can be found throughout old laptops  vcr s and dvd players. take apart desktop computer towers to find the ribbon wire and insulated connectors in the board and hard drive. large appliances are often sold for steel. but don t forget to look inside for copper wiring. small appliances such as coffee makers  ac units  fans  blenders and toasters may all have copper wiring inside. small electronics  such as cell phones  cameras and hand held games are good places to search for copper wire.    electricians scrape up electrical wire for scrap during demolition. plumbing materials also contain copper and brass. always check with the owner or a construction supervisor before taking copper away from a property that you do not own. even if you are being paid to clean a demolition site  that does not give you a claim to the wire or any other materials you find there.   look for old statues or d cor. old garden gnomes  statues and other lawn ornaments may contain copper. in addition  sometimes roofing material is made from copper sheeting. roofing copper is recyclable and environmentally friendly.  unless you have permission to remove copper from a property you do not own  it is considered theft. copper theft has been on the rise since the value of copper started to increase in 2004.   cnbc refers to copper theft as an epidemic that is sweeping the united states.the fbi states that copper theft is threatening the infrastructure of the united states. thieves are targeting electrical sub stations  cellular towers  telephone land lines  railroads  water wells  construction sites  and vacant homes. delivery of electricity  water  telecommunications  transportation and security and emergency services is disrupted. this poses a threat to public safety and national security.businesses are taking steps to protect themselves from copper theft. they are installing security cameras  securing metals in locked areas  installing alarms  limiting access to buildings and increasing lighting.in many states  the difference between a misdemeanor and a felony has to do with the value of items stolen. since copper is so valuable  copper thieves are often charged with a felony when caught. also  since copper thieves can knock out traffic lights or disrupt 911 services  other felony charges such as disrupting public service may be filed.

query	187	drink diet coke clean a toilet with coke  open a bottle or can of coke. you won t need much to clean your toilet   a standard sized soda can contains 12 fluid ounces  1.5 cups   which should be plenty. if you have a bigger container of coke  measure about this much and pour it into a glass.   coke works as a cleaner because of the gentle carbonic and phosphoric acid it contains. these chemicals come from the carbonation  not from the flavorings in the soda  so diet coke works just as well as regular coke. this also means that club soda and many other carbonated beverages can be substituted for coke  though these are rarely as cheap .  pour the coke around the rim of the bowl. let it flow over the stains below. be sure to give all the stains a good even coating of coke   it will appear to wash into the bottom of the bowl  but a thin coat will remain on the stain.   for stains high in the bowl that are hard to reach  try soaking an old rag in coke and applying it by hand. you can also use a spray bottle filled with coke if you prefer not to get your hands dirty.    patience is key. the longer you let the coke sit  the more of a chance you give the acids in the coke to break down the stains. try to let the coke sit for at least an hour without disturbing it.   for extra cleaning power  pour the coke in before you go to bed and let it sit in the toilet overnight.    while you let the coke sit  the acids will slowly loosen the built up stains in the bowl. now  flush the toilet once. the loosened stains should be  at least partially  rinsed away with the toilet water.    at this point  you can see how well the coke was able to remove the stains. while coke usually works well for the sorts of rings and built up mineral stains that are common problems in toilets  it may not completely eliminate every stain. if desired  simply re apply a second layer of coke and repeat the process.   if your stains just won t seem to go away with a second application of coke  check out the section below  which has suggestions for especially hard to remove toilet stains.    a good old fashioned toilet brush is your best bet if simple flushing won t remove your stains. the mechanical action of a brush  or a similar item  like an abrasive pad  will further loosen built up stains and help remove them from the walls of the bowl after you ve treated them with coke. be sure to wash your hands after scrubbing and wear gloves if germs make you squeamish.   for best results  scrub before and after using the coke. in other words  open the bowl and scrub the stains with the brush. apply the coke. let the coke sit. scrub once again with the brush and flush to rinse the stains away.    in general  chemical reactions happen much more quickly at high temperatures. the acid reactions that allow coke to remove stains from toilet bowls are no exception. for difficult stains  try heating up your coke in the microwave before you apply it to the bowl. it doesn t need to be boiling  but for best results it should be hot to the touch  so use caution when handling the hot coke.   never microwave soda  or any liquid  in a sealed container or a container made of metal. this can lead to dangerous explosions of hot liquid. instead  pour the soda into a microwave safe glass  like one made of glass or ceramic   then microwave it. heating coke will make it fizz slightly more than normal  so you may want to wear gloves to avoid getting splashed with tiny drops of soda.  while coke can remove many stains  it s not always the absolute best cleaning agent for the job. for very difficult stains  you may want to try pairing it with other cleaning solutions. here are some other cleaning methods you can try with items around the house    try mixing 1 2 cup vinegar and 1 4 cup baking soda  or 2 teaspoons borax  into 1 2 gallon  2 liters  jug of water. apply the mixture to the toilet bowl  scrubbing and waiting an hour before flushing. follow with coke treatment as needed. for mold  try mixing one part hydrogen peroxide with two parts water in a spray bottle. spray it onto the moldy surface  let sit at least one hour  and scrub until the mold dissolves. use coke to remove any residual stains or scaling around the moldy spot. try mixing two parts borax with one part lemon juice and one part coke for another versatile cleaning agent. apply the mix to the toilet bowl  let it rest an hour  then scrub off the stains.    coke is suitable for most of the mineral deposits and rings that commonly occur in toilets. however  it won t always work for rarer stains  so other solutions are sometimes necessary. see below    coke isn t great for removing oil  fat  or grease based stains. for these  you re better off using dish soap  detergent  or a stronger acid like vinegar.coke isn t great at killing germs. in fact  the sugary residue left behind by regular coke can actually feed certain types of bacteria. stick to soap  a commercial cleaning solution  or an alcohol based sanitizer to kill microorganisms. coke won t remove stains caused by inks  dyes  or pigments. rubbing alcohol and other chemical solvents are often the best choice here.

technique to blow into the mouthpiece of the horn.   you want to blow into the horn using fast  quick blows.make sure you re not pressing your mouth into the mouthpiece too hard. if your teeth hurt or a ring appears on your lips  you re pressing too hard. you want a relaxed tension against the mouthpiece when you blow into it.  it will make your life a lot easier to learn exactly where the keys are so that your fingers know where to go when you re playing.   through repeated playing muscle memory builds  so your fingers know where the keys are. practices pressing the keys  knowing which keys you re pressing. do this until you can pass a test of accuracy.it can help to have a fingering chart while you practice.  the volume of the notes you play will depend on how much air you blow into the horn  and how fast. the more air you blow  and the faster you blow it  the louder the note will sound  and vice versa .  to be a good french horn player you ll want to learn how to read music.   sheet music is the basis of many musical performances. you can also learn by ear  but most songs are played from sheet music. learning sheet music gives you a deeper understanding of how your instrument works  as well as music theory.  the most basic thing you ll learn first is the order of the notes and how they re placed on a music staff.many parts go into the relationship between notes and the staff. that s why this piece is so fundamental.    once you ve memorized the notes  the next step is to understand how the clefs work.there are two clefs that can show up on a music staff. the treble clef notates the higher pitches of music  and the bass clef notates the lower pitches.    sheet music notates how fast or slow a song is by the tempo. it s usually notated at the top of the sheet using a bpm  beats per minute  measurement.  once you have a pretty good understanding of the basics of sheet music  try playing a simple melody. pick something that only has a few notes and practice until you ve mastered it.    eventually  you can practice playing more complex melodies. this will help you play your instrument better and help you become better at reading sheet music.   pick music that has a variety of note structures  clefs  and tempos.    now that you can hold your instrument and play sitting down  it s time to play standing up. a french horn weighs about 4 pounds. there won t be many times when you ll need to play standing up  but recitals are a common one.since your right hand is in the bell anyway  just slide it up to the top of the bell so that it s resting on your hand. all your other hand placements stay the same. you can buy small modification pieces that help hold up the horn easier.    once you ve mastered the basics you re ready to learn more advanced playing techniques. it can be helpful to recruit a tutor or advanced player for these skills.   muting  or stopping  the horn creates a high pitched sound from the bell. you can stop the horn by moving your hand further into the bell until it s in all the way. twist it until little or no air can get out.slurring notes are playing two notes without stopping or releasing between. to do this you ll continue to change the notes on your keys but your airflow remains constant and steady.playing glissando is starting and ending on specific notes while playing as many notes between as you can.  lessons are a great way to learn advanced skills and get feedback on your progress. you can hire private tutors or join group classes. some classes will play at events  giving you an opportunity to show off your new chops.    you can find a lot of useful tutorial videos online. some of them will teach you to play using sheet music  and some will teach you to play by ear. if you search  you should find what you re looking for.    the most effective way to become a better horn player is to practice. make time to play your horn on a regular basis. create challenges for yourself by upping the ante on songs you play.   you can get books of sheet music that have a variety of songs with different levels of difficulty. tutor books sometimes include training schedules  often with lessons on reading sheet music.  don t be afraid to ask questions when you get stuck or aren t sure how to do something. there are lots of places you can go to get your questions answered.   you can consult tutors  french horn websites  video comment threads  and forums.    when you re not playing your horn  store it in a padded case. most cases have a hard shell to protect it from damage.    each time you play your horn you should clean it. this will prolong the life of the instrument.   polish it using a polishing cloth. if it s dirty  you can apply polishing gauze with a cloth.let the interior of the instrument dry. remove the valve slides and dry those while the rest of the body is drying.  every week or two you ll want to conduct routine maintenance on your instrument to make sure it stays in good condition for as long as possible.   clean the mouthpiece with dish soap and water. it might also be helpful to use a mouthpiece brush  which you can find at most music stores.oil the rotors and valves. remove the valve caps and apply key oil to the pivot points and bearing shaft.you ll know the valves need to be oiled if they stick.apply slide grease to the tuning slides. remove them  put the grease on them  and replace them.  every once in a while  you should do a full cleanse on your horn. that means flushing out the entire instrument with soap and water. use a brush to clean the tuning slides.if you want to take special care you can use brass soap to clean the horn.make sure you apply grease to the tuning slides before putting them back on the body of the horn.  if anything on your horn breaks  take it to a shop and get it repaired. it s a delicate piece of machinery that won t work if some of the parts are defective.  
query	192	drive a manual transmission gear stick start a manual car  but don t turn it just yet   if you do  nothing will happen  there are several more steps you need to take before you can safely start the car.           in a manual transmission car there are three pedals   the clutch  the brake and the accelerator gas. it is essential that you have a firm grasp of which pedal is which before you begin driving.          the pedal on the far left is the clutch. it allows you to disengage the engine from the wheels while you are changing gears. it should be operated using your left foot. the middle pedal is the brake and the pedal on the far right is the accelerator. both of these pedals are operated using the right foot. remember that the order of these pedals does not change regardless of whether you are in a left hand drive or right hand drive vehicle.    before you can start the car  you will need to ensure that the car is in neutral. the car is in neutral when            the gear shift is in the neutral position. you can tell it s in the neutral position if it feels loose to the touch and you can move it easily from side to side. if the gear shift is not in neutral  you can fix this by pressing down fully on the clutch and moving the shift into the central  neutral  position.  the clutch is fully depressed. if you prefer  you can also put the car in neutral by pressing down fully on the clutch with your left foot.    once the car is in neutral  you are ready to turn the key in the ignition and start the car. just remember           if you put the car into neutral by moving the gear shift into the neutral position  you can turn the key in the ignition without having to depress the clutch pedal. however  if you put the car into neutral by simply pressing down on the clutch  while the shift is still in gear   you will need to hold the clutch down as you turn the key. otherwise the car could lunge forward.    once the car is running  you will need to put the car into gear before you can start moving.  unless your car is already in gear  in which case you can just skip to step 3 . to put your car in gear  press down fully on the clutch.           keeping your foot pressed down on the clutch  move the gear shift into first gear. this is usually done by moving the gear shift to the left and then up   the number 1 should be clearly marked on the top left corner of the stick.           very slowly  begin inching your foot off the clutch pedal. keep lifting your foot until the engine speed  or rpm  begins to drop and the car begins to move slowly forward. this is known as the  biting point .           once you find the biting point  it s time to start pressing down on the accelerator  slowly and gently.          as your right foot begins to press down on the accelerator  your left foot should continue to release the clutch  in a simultaneous motion. if you complete this action correctly  the car will start to move forward and you will be driving in first gear.    be careful   if you release the clutch too quickly  the car will stall  stop running  and you will have to start the process again.          on the other hand  if you press down too hard on the accelerator before the clutch is fully released you may wear out the clutch  causing damage to your vehicle. don t worry though   you are bound to stall at least a couple of times when you re learning to drive a manual transmission car. finding the perfect balance between releasing the clutch and depressing the accelerator takes practice.    when your engine begins to race and sounds like it s under pressure  usually around 2500 to 3000 rpm   though this varies depending on the car   you will need to move up into second gear. to do this           take your right foot off the accelerator  if necessary  and use your left foot to fully depress the clutch. grab the gear shift and move it straight downwards into second gear   which should be clearly marked by the number 2 on the stick.    you will need to follow a slightly different procedure for starting your manual transmission car if you are parked on a hill. this is necessary to prevent the car from rolling backwards.           to perform a hill start using the brake pedal  begin with your left foot depressing the clutch and your right foot depressing the brake. put the car into gear  release the hand brake  then lift your foot off the clutch until you find the biting point. now release the brake  keeping the clutch at the biting point will prevent the car from rolling backwards  and press down on the accelerator  using slightly more gas than usual. continue as normal.           to perform a hill start using the hand brake  put your foot on the clutch and put the car into gear. slowly release the clutch until you find the biting point  then release the hand brake. once you have released the hand brake  put your foot on the accelerator and proceed as normal.

query	202	rent a jet ski jet ski pick a boat  this is the first thing to consider about a boat. typically  people buy their  dream boat  and soon realize how much more it will cost them on a monthly and an annual basis. the simple rule of thumb is regardless of how old your boat or personal watercraft is  you should expect to pay 10 15  of the replacement value per year. yes  this means if you buy a boat for  10 000  but it s replacement value is  50 000 you can generally expect to pay between  5 000 and  7 500 per year in maintenance and slip fees. the range is given because if you trailer your boat  you will likely spend around 10 . if it is kept in the water  you have added expenses of slip fees  hull cleaning  and every 2 3 years a bottom job  more or less recoating and repainting of the hull . this rule of 10 15  does not include fuel usage. you will also need to keep in mind boats are tremendously inefficient gas or diesel users because they push the water out of the way.    now that you have determined what your future budget will allow  determine what you want to do on your boat. most boats can be narrowed down to the following uses  fishing  freshwater or saltwater   water sports  wakeboarding  kneeboarding  water skiing  towable   sailing  using wind to power your boat   cruising  weekender camping on the water   personal watercraft  jet skis  wave runners  etc.   and luxury yachting.    you will also need to figure out if you will primarily be on a lake river or on the ocean  and subsequently how far out in the ocean you plan on going . for most fishermen who fish on a lake river  the most popular boats range from 10 20  long and are typically aluminum or fiberglass hull boats. these boats tend to have a low profile so you can  walk  your rod around the boat unobstructed. these boats have a shallow draft  depth into the water  and produce a very small wake. people who chose boats for watersports usually chose a combination of a fish ski boat or a straight water ski oriented boat. these boats are either u or v hull in shape and can be modified to produce a wake or little wake. these boats typically have 150 400 horsepower engines with the bulk of the power used to get the towed person  out of the water  and riding on top of it   sport pontoons have become a popular mixed use boat over the last 20 years. the next type of boat is a sailboat. while you do not have as much of the expense of using gas or diesel on a sailboat  you will need to replace the sail every few years  which  in the long run can be as expensive as if you did use gas . sailboats have a weighted keel to keep the boat from tipping over. sailing instruction is recommended for anyone who wants to pursue boat use  because you will learn not only boater safety  but how the current  wind  and theory behind boating. cruisers are typically 25 45  in length and are considered by those who want to  camp  the weekend. these boats usually have 1 2 staterooms  bedrooms   a bathroom  a galley  kitchen   and many of the same amenities found in a rv  recreational vehicle . pwcs  personal water crafts  are usually for those who want to experience the thrill of going fast on the water. pwcs are the most dangerous of all boat vehicles because of how fast they can go and the inherent risks associated with them. as with motorcycles  pwc riders have to ride within their limits and also ride defensively as many other boaters do not see pwcs coming their way in time to avoid them. pwcs  generally speaking  have the  least rights  when it comes to the rules of the road. luxury yachts typically are ocean going vessels  although you will find many on larger lakes . these boats are typically not towed  as the above others usually are . these boats are made for extended cruises away from shore. these boats usually have the capacity to live aboard with various items such as a freshwater maker  generators  gps radar equipment  multiple staterooms  heads  bathrooms   and galleys. the luxury yacht will typically cost you over  1 million to buy new. you can certainly use many of the above listed boats to go out to sea  but the luxury yacht will provide comfort and security of size.    you should next figure out how many people will typically ride on your boat  don t forget to count yourself . boats under 28 feet  8.5 m  do have limits to the number of riders  boats over 28 feet  8.5 m  typically do not  but many have strict rules if they are coast guard regulated and if you are a licensed captain you will need to follow passenger rules.    usually boats under 30  can be towed by standard full sized trucks. pwcs can be towed by cars or suvs. sailboats and cruisers may require special set up to tow and yachts are rarely ever towed. you will need to decide do you want a boat you want to keep in the water or one that you can transport place to place. you will also want to determine the length of the boat you want by the conditions you will use it in. for instance  a skiff or a flat bottom boat is perfect for small lakes  but would be incredibly dangerous on larger lakes with more fetch  wind caused waves . a yacht doesn t make sense on lakes  even larger ones  that freeze over in the wintertime. boat length determines the number of passengers and conditions you can safely operate the boat in.    there are various types of engines and placement of those engines. an outboard is mounted on to the transom  back  of the boat and usually uses a jack plate. an outboard pushes the boat forward...literally. outboards are great for fishing and watersports. an inboard engine is usually placed  inside  the boat either in the center or rear of the boat. the shaft and propeller are usually extended to the transom of the boat. most cruisers and yachts have inboards. a stern drive engine is mounted directly to the transom of the boat  unlike an outboard that is more easily  removable  . a jet engine is an engine that cycles water through jets and pushes the water at a rate fast enough to push the boat   most pwcs and small speed boats use this water  jet  power. sailing is the use of wind as propulsion. and finally  human power is normally considered for paddle boats  canoes  kayaks  and such.    once you have determined you are comfortable with the cost  type  size  propulsion  etc. of the boat you will now need to decide if you want a new or used boat. either way  you should remember this...you will roughly spend 10 15  of the new value per year in maintaining your boat. used boats can be project boats and ultimately should be bought by people who can either a  afford to have someone fix it or b  have the time to fix it themselves.

query	212	install replacement window install replacement windows  this choice should be made based on the styling of your home  as well as your budget. the four common frame types are  wood  vinyl or metal clad wood  and all vinyl or all wood.   wood frames  if the exterior of your home features natural wood siding  a wood frame will complement your home nicely. wood frames are generally more expensive  but they do offer a low heat transfer and can be very energy efficient. if you re looking for low maintenance  however  they don t exactly fit the bill. they must be properly primed and painted  as well as repainted every few years to maintain their appeal. vinyl metal clad window frames  many replacement window manufacturers offer a wood frame window with a metal or vinyl  wrapping  on the exterior of the window. as long as the  wrapping  is sealed  the window is relatively maintenance free. you can also choose a color that complements the exterior of your home  without having to repaint every few years.  keep in mind that although the window unit is maintenance free  you will still have to either paint the exterior trim to match the window wrapping or replace the trim with a vinyl product like azek.   metal window frames  if you re looking for low maintenance as well as low cost  a metal frame might be a good choice. metal windows and siding are less stylish than they used to be  but that doesn t mean that you can t make them look good in your home. vinyl frames  vinyl replacement windows are extremely popular because they are easy to install  cost effective  and energy efficient.         some people take the height measurement from the top of the sill. this leaves room to attach a  header expander  to the top of the new window. others  though  dislike using header expanders because they decrease effective window size  and complicate the trim process.    since the new unit will need to be installed at least close to plumb  adjust your measurements accordingly. this will ensure that you have the largest size window that can be installed plumb  and level in the opening provided.    this is due to the fact that replacement windows are made to order in increments of 1 4.     this will keep the paint from chipping or peeling away from the casing when you remove the stops. this will also make removing the window stops easier  paint is a surprisingly good adhesive.   use a thin flat bar or even a putty knife to separate stubborn joints. this will minimize denting or marring other parts of the window trim.    using a hinging motion  swing the top of the window into the room until it is horizontal. then  twist the window into the opening by lifting up one side and pressing down on the other until the window is free.   every window is different some might take a little muscle to remove. don t worry about scratching the inside of the jambs while removing the window  it ll get covered anyway. if the window is cracked or particularly stubborn  wear gloves and eye protection in case it shatters while removing it.    if the original window was an older  weighted window  there may be pulleys at the top of the jamb that need to be removed. clear any dust from the bottom corners of the frame to ensure a good bond with the sealant.    if there were weights  remove the pulleys and apply a small amount of caulk to any holes.    sill flashing for a vinyl window is an  l  shaped piece of vinyl that is the same width as the replacement window unit. the vertical part of the  l  shape is slotted  allowing it to clip onto the bottom  outer edge of the window unit and shed water away from the bottom of the window.    mark both sides where it hits the exterior window stops. remove the lower part of the  l  shape on both sides as marked to allow the sill flashing to fit into place. once trimmed  lay the sill flashing back in place and trace the outside edge with a pencil.    make sure you get both sides and the top. then  apply a 1 4  bead directly to the wood sill on the inside of your pencil line.   nan  the bottom should be angled away and in to the opening. once the bottom of the unit has cleared the sill and is against the exterior stops  press down on the window and swing the top into the frame.   press the window firmly and evenly against the stops to ensure a good seal.     these are usually located about four inches from the top and bottom on both sides.    be sure the window is centered in the window opening.  keep in mind that vinyl is much softer  and more flexible than wood. over tightening the screws can damage the frame of the window.    nan nan  leave about a 1 4  gap along the bottom. this gap should be parallel to the windowsill.   if the gap is larger on the right side  loosen the top right screw and tighten the top left screw or loosen the bottom left screw and tighten the bottom right screw. if the gap is larger on the left side  loosen the top left screw and tighten the top right screw or loosen the bottom right screw and tighten the bottom left screw.   nan nan  if necessary  apply a thin bead around the perimeter to eliminate any voids  and leave a smooth  weather tight seal.

window  that you re trying to replicate on your own. look for inspiration in books and in nature. beginners should choose a pattern that is broad and simple  such as a flower  although  be mindful of the curves and the sharp edges .    sheet glass is what you ll be using for this project. it falls into two basic categories  cathedral and opalescent. you will also need to consider things like price  texture  color  and degree of transparency.   stained glass comes in large sheets. the smallest sheet is approximately 1 foot  0.3 m  by 1 foot  30.48 cm by 30.48 cm  with the largest being four times that size. buy enough glass for the size of your project  but keep in mind that about a quarter of what you buy will not be utilized after trimming. cathedral glass tends to be a clear or transparent color. it s composed of clear glass with colorants added. this glass requires less pressure to cut through opalescent glass incorporates white  or opal glass  into the color mix. an opalescent blue is blue glass that is not entirely transparent  for example. opalescent glass tends to require more pressure to cut through  because the opal of the glass creates a higher density than cathedral glass. you can combine these two types together in your project if you want an interesting mix of clear and opaque. keep in mind that they need slightly differently handling  as evidenced by the pressure needed to cut through them . there is also streaky glass which tends to be cathedral glass with streaks of opal mixed in.    the best place to get stained glass for your project is at a stained glass supply shop. you can find both equipment for making stained glass as well as the stained glass itself. you can also get stained glass at some of the larger hobby and craft stores  but you ll get a better selection at a shop specific to stained glass.   most of the glass you buy comes in sheets about one square foot  30 cm  and one eighth of an inch thick. the sheet can be anywhere from  6 to  20 depending on the color and the detail in the glass  the strength and brightness of the colors. it can also depend on where the glass comes from. glass that comes from europe is simply going to cost more. this is often called antique glass even if it was made in modern times.    you ll need to gather some specific equipment for making your stained glass project. you can find these items at most hobby or craft stores  but especially at stained glass supply shops.glass cutter  there are lots of different glass cutters available. the hand cutter has the best flexibility and accuracy in template cutting. the pencil style cutter is great for beginners  as well as those doing trace cutting  because it has consistent pressure and control. the pistol grip is great for cutting thick glass and is also a good choice for beginners whose hand strength isn t enough. pliers  ordinary house pliers shouldn t be used for this. you ll need grozer pliers for breaking glass and nipping off edges as well as running pliers for snapping long cuts in the glass. copper foil comes in a variety of widths depending on the width of your glass. this is used to hold the glass pieces together through the adhesive on the one side. if you re using cathedral glass  clear glass  the backing will be visible so make sure you re using the right color for your piece. soldering iron and solder  solder is a mixture of tin and lead. the higher the tin content  the lower the melting point  which means it will flow more quickly and with a more silvery finish. as for the soldering iron you ll need one that is designed for stained glass projects with a minimum of 75 watts. the irons come with different sized tips  depending on your project. grinder  if you don t have access to a grinder you can use a carborundum stone to grind down the edges of your glass after cutting. if you can get a grinder the electric glass grinder is great for dealing with sharp edges quickly.    draw  copy or print out your pattern on a piece of graph paper that s the actual size. cut the pattern into its separate pieces and label them by color and grain direction. place the pattern under the glass and trace the outline with a thin permanent marker.leave a centimeter or less of room for the thickness of the copper foil between the pieces. use either a specialty black pen or a permanent marker to mark the glass. if you have access to a lightbox this can be incredibly helpful for tracing the pattern onto the glass.    hold the glass cutter between your thumb and your forefinger with the tip pressed between your forefinger and your middle finger. press the cutter into the glass gently  using a cork backed  steel ruler to cut straight. begin at a point away from your body and begin scraping inward.make sure that you re applying the right amount of pressure. you should hear a nice  clear  zzzzip  as you score. if you apply too little pressure  the break will not follow the score line. too much pressure and you ll cause unnecessary wear and tear on your cutter as well as your wrist and elbow. move your pattern around  rotating the glass as necessary to keep proper form. make sure that the score line goes from edge to edge.    there are a few slightly different methods to cutting your glass  depending on the size and the curve of the glass. the goal  of course  is to cut the glass along the scored lines so that it breaks apart easily and leaves you with the shapes that you need.   for straight pieces  as soon as you see a line forming  place pliers in the crack and squeeze to separate the piece. you can also hold the glass on either side of the break and snap it apart with your hands.for curved sections  use the glass cutter to break through the scoring. don t worry if the piece breaks off slightly jagged  you can remove edges later if you need to. as long as you keep your curves gentle. if you re dealing with deep curves  deal with it in a series of shallow curves so that it won t break on its own.  once you ve cut all the different pieces  it s time to grind down the sharp edges and make sure that everything is smooth. you will want to grind away gently and patiently so that you don t chip any of the pieces.   put the pieces along the pattern again so that you can grind down the glass into corrective lines. this will make sure that everything fits well together when you put the glass pieces together. it s also a good idea to build a frame around the pieces when you ve finished grinding them and fitting them together. this way the pieces won t slip when you re foiling the glass.    cover the edges of the glass with 7 32 inch copper foil. make sure the foil is centered  otherwise it can look a little funky at the end.. this can be done by hand or with a table foiler.   once you ve decided on the thickness of your copper foil  you need to peel off the protective backing of the foil. make sure that you center your glass correctly on the tape and press it securely along all the cut edges. press the foil down hard with tongue depressor  or other firm instrument. this will ensure the foil adheres to the glass. you will want to make sure that the tape is very securely adhered as well as even. if a section gets bunched up  tear it off and start again.    while flux helps the solder flow between the copper taped pieces  it isn t one hundred percent necessary. however  it can make things easier for you in the long run.   brush each copper foiled surface with the flux before you solder each time. the gel form is the easiest and most forgiving to use  although you can also try out the liquid form.    soldering the glass takes a bit of time and patience. there are several different things you need to do to make sure you re soldering properly. you have to tack together your pieces  then you have to tin the seams  and finally you add the bead.   to tack all the pieces together apply small dots of flux to desired areas  and melt a small blob of solder on top. once you ve got all the pieces tacked together you can tin the seams. to tin the seams you first add flux to all of the seams  then apply a thin  flat amount of solder to all of the seams. make sure that you completely coat all of the copper foil. apply a new layer of flux to the tinned seams  then melt a larger amount of solder onto the seams. run your soldering iron back and forth over to create a melted seam of solder. once a section is completely melted you ll lift the iron up from your piece to create a smooth bead.    framing isn t absolutely necessary but it can create a nice finish to your piece. you could use a zinc frame or a lead channel  which requires more soldering  exactly the same as the steps outlined above.    especially when you re a beginner you can screw up with cutting the glass or grinding it down. this will leave you with gaps between your pieces.   compensate for these inaccuracies by filling the gaps between your glass pieces with copper solder. solder as you would normally.    there are lots of things that can go wrong with scoring your glass and most of these have to do with how you re standing  how much pressure you re using  and what sort of a cutter you re using.make sure that you re standing for long scores. this will give you better reach by utilizing your shoulder and upper body in the scoring motion. for small scores  make sure that you stay seated so you can concentrate on following the marker score line. use the right glass cutter. you do not want to use a five dollar cheap glass cutter as it doesn t cut clear  thin glass very well and it certainly won t cut much harder art glass. get one that it has a carbide head  because the oil lubrication is very useful. make sure that you apply even pressure throughout your scoring. remember you should hear a zipping sound as you score. also good to remember  opalescent glass requires more pressure  cathedral glass requires less pressure.    like scoring  soldering your glass can yield some problems if you re not doing it correctly. make sure that the heat is correct  that the tip of the soldering iron is the right size for the project  and that the flux you re using is good for higher temperatures.using the wrong kind of flux can lead to charring  called  black tip syndrome.  when this happens it means that the tip of the soldering iron turns black and re tinning becomes impossible. use the right size soldering iron tip. make sure that you know what the width of the glass you re working with is and have the tip and the copper spaced accordingly.  
query	214	recharge automotive battery recharge batteries  rechargeable batteries are most often charged in an a c adapter  which you can plug into a basic home outlet. these chargers feature terminals sized in a variety of ways  from aaa to d. depending on what kind of batteries you want to charge  you can usually find a charger appropriate for the size at any electronics or hardware store.   some chargers feature a variety of adaptable sizes  meaning you can charger aa and aaa on the same terminals. if you ve got a lot of different sized batteries  this would be an ideal choice. rapid chargers are similar to regular chargers  but often don t have a charge control mechanism that halts or slows the flow of voltage. these are effective at quickly charging batteries  but can reduce the life of the battery more significantly.    never try to recharge single use batteries  or you risk causing corrosion and damage to your charger. only try to recharge batteries specifically labeled  rechargeable.  if you ve got some dead single use batteries  dispose of them properly and buy rechargeable ones.   nickel metal hydride  nimh  batteries are common in consumer products  especially power tools  while lithium ion batteries are common in electronics. both varieties of battery are commonly used and both are rechargeable. when you first start to use a new set of rechargeable batteries  run them completely down before recharging them. this will decrease the possibility of a phenomenon called  memory effect   which is when the battery s capacity diminishes from being recharged prematurely. use a battery tester to determine if there is life left in a battery before attempting to recharge it. many battery testers are inexpensive  easy to use and provide an instant reading.    with most a c adapter chargers  a power light should come on automatically  or by flipping an  on  switch. make sure that any power indicator lights come on  and you ll be ready to start charging your batteries.   always defer to the manufacturer s instructions. read the battery charger instruction manual thoroughly  which should contain important information  including the time it takes to complete charging  a key to indicator lights and safety information specific to the batteries being used.    this means putting the positive     ends into contact with the charger s positive terminals and likewise with the negative     ends.   on most a c chargers  there should be a diagram showing you how to orient the batteries properly. generally  the flat side of the battery should rest against the spring  and the  bump  on the battery should rest against the flatter side.    most chargers should change a light from green to red  or vice versa when the batteries are fully charged. do not interrupt the process by unplugging the charger s cord or by removing the batteries early  or the battery life will be significantly diminished.    overcharging of batteries is the primary cause of a reduction in the life of the battery  especially in rapid charge chargers.    trickle charge  is a technique of lowering the charge to roughly 10 percent of the capacity of the battery  which is usually enough to keep a battery fully charged  without triggering the discharge that results in a diminished capacity of battery life.most manufacturer s don t recommend long term trickle charging  but if you have a charger with an adjustable charge rate  dropping it to a lower rate can be an effective way of keeping your batteries juiced.    make certain that the vehicle is shut off completely and remove the grounded terminal first  to prevent arcing  then move the battery to a well ventilated area to charge it.   it is possible to charge a battery without removing it  but you need to know whether or not the battery is grounded to the chassis  to avoid clipping the negative in the wrong place. if it is grounded to the chassis  clip the positive to the positive terminal  and the negative to the chassis. if it isn t  then clip the negative charger to the negative terminal  and the positive to the chassis.if you want to know how to jump your vehicle  read this article.    on most well used car batteries  corrosion will typically build up around the terminals  and it s important to clean these periodically to make sure that your battery terminals make good contact with the leads. the best way to do this is to use plain baking soda and water  and brush the terminals with an old toothbrush to remove the corrosion.   refill each cell with distilled water  to the proper manufacturer levels  if necessary. do not overfill. some lead acid batteries won t have removable ports  so defer to the manufacturer s instructions as always.    usually  you ll be able to find this in the owner s manual for your vehicle  if it isn t listed on the battery itself. if you re unsure  you can also usually visit any auto parts retailer and have them check for your  at no charge.    depending on your vehicle and the battery in it  you ll need a charger with enough capacity to recharge it. typically  batteries will be either 6 or 12 volts  but depending on whether or not your battery is a standard  agm  and deep charge model  you may need a stronger charger  depending.some chargers are manual  which means you ll have to shut them off when the battery is fully charged  while other automatic batteries will shut off when the battery is full. other than that  and slight differences in design  all chargers work in essentially the same way. again  if you re not sure  head to the auto parts store for a quick check. you don t have to pay for it  and you ll be sure you ve got the right info.    after you know the voltage of your battery  you can set the output voltage to match. most chargers have digital readouts  which just let you toggle up or down to the appropriate voltage. some chargers have adjustable rates  but it s always better to start lower and slower than you think your battery might be able to take.    chargers come with two clips  one of which you should attach to the positive battery terminal and one of which to the negative. switch the charger to the  off  position and remove the plug from the wall to be safe. don t let the clips touch each other at any point during the process  and turn away from the battery itself when you make the final connection.   first  connect the positive cable  which is usually the ungrounded one. next  connect a jumper cable or an insulated battery cable that s at least two feet long to the negative post  and connect the negative battery cable to this cable. if the battery is still in the car  you ll want to clip the ungrounded cable to the ungrounded peg on the battery  and the grounded cable somewhere to the chassis of the car. never clip a charger to the carburetor  fuel lines  or the body of the vehicle.    stretch the cables as far as they go  and never place the charger directly above the battery that s being charged. corrosive gasses will sometimes be emitted from the battery  which can be dangerous.    depending on the battery and the charger you re using  it may take as many as 8 12 hours to charge your battery. if you re using an automatic charger  it should shut off as soon as the battery is charged. if you re using a manual charger  you ll need to check and make sure the battery is charged before you do.   if you want to know how to use a voltmeter to do this  read this article.

query	216	serve barbecue sauce cook pig feet  rinse the pig feet under cool  running water. use a vegetable brush to scrub away any dirt and debris.   dry the clean pig feet with paper towels before continuing.    carefully hold each pig foot over the flame of the candle  rotating it periodically  to burn off as many hairs as possible.   if you have a gas stove  you can turn on one stove eye to low heat and use the stove flame instead of a candle. it s important to use relatively low heat regardless of the method you choose. using high heat or a large flame can result in accidental burns. to the same end  you should also avoid holding your hand too close to the flame while removing the hairs.    examine the pig feet. use a new  disposable razor or clean pair of tweezers to remove any hairs you couldn t burn off.   the razor will be quicker but will only remove hair from the surface of the foot. the tweezers will be able to remove the entire hair  however  even the portion sitting beneath the skin. once you finish removing the hairs  the pig feet should be ready to use in any recipe.    place the pig s feet  celery  onion  garlic  bay leaves  salt  black pepper  red pepper flakes  and white vinegar in a large stockpot or dutch oven.   wash the pig feet and remove the hairs before placing them in the pot. use a durable mixing spoon to toss the ingredients together after combining them.    pour enough water into the stockpot to cover the pig feet by at least 2 inches  5 cm . set the stockpot on the stove over medium high heat.allow the water to reach a rolling boil over medium high heat.    once the water reaches a boil  reduce the heat to medium low or low  dropping the water to a steady simmer. cover and cook the pig feet until the meat becomes tender.   watch the pig feet as they simmer. periodically stir the contents of the stockpot and skim away any foam that develops along the surface. when ready  the pork should be so tender that it nearly falls off the bone.  shortly before serving the pig feet  pour the barbecue sauce into a separate saucepan and heat it gently over medium low to medium heat.   you should heat the sauce through so that s slightly warm. a few bubbles are okay  but do not bring the sauce to a full boil. ideally  you should start heating the barbecue sauce within the final 10 minutes of cooking time for the pig feet. if you are unable to time it precisely  you can wait until the pig feet are finished cooking before heating the sauce  remove the pig feet from the heat of the stove beforehand to prevent them from overcooking.    remove the pig feet from the cooking water using a slotted spoon. toss each foot into the warm barbecue sauce and turn to coat.   if the pan of sauce is large enough  coat all the pig feet at once. otherwise  coat each pig foot individually and transfer them to a serving platter when done.    serve the pig feet immediately to enjoy the best flavor. if desired  you can serve additional barbecue sauce on the side.    place the pig feet in a stockpot and cover them with water. bring the water to a boil over medium high heat  and cook the pig feet for about 3 minutes.   you should clean the pig feet and remove any hairs before completing this step. parboiling the pig feet can help remove some of the odd flavor  thereby preventing it from leeching into the braising liquid you ll use during the primary portion of the cooking process.    after parboiling the pig feet  remove them from the water using a slotted spoon. set them aside for now.   discard the cooking water. you should not reuse this water in later steps calling for additional water.    pour the cooking oil into a large  deep wok. warm it on the stove for about 1 minute over medium high heat.   the oil should become glossier and thinner  making it easy to spread it over the bottom of the pan. note that you could use a dutch oven or stockpot if you do not have a deep wok.    cook for 1 minute  stirring frequently  then add the chili peppers  star anise  and cloves. stir fry for an additional 2 minutes.   stir frequently to prevent any of the ingredients from burning. you only need to cook them long enough to release the scent and flavor from each ingredient. note that the amount of chili peppers should vary depending on personal taste. use 3 dried chili peppers if you prefer mild to moderate heat or 5 dried chili peppers if you enjoy strong heat.    add the drained pig feet  soy sauce  rice wine  sugar  and salt to the wok. pour in enough water to just barely cover the pig feet.   allow the braising broth to reach a rolling boil  stirring lightly as it heats up.    reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. simmer the pig feet for about 2 hours  or until the meat is tender enough to nearly fall off the bone.stir the contents of the pot every 10 to 15 to prevent the pig feet from burning and sticking to the bottom. the sauce will eventually thicken. if this happens while the pig feet still seem tough  add more water 1 cup  250 ml  at a time and continue cooking. if the sauce still seems thin once the pig feet are done  remove the lid and increase the heat to medium. continue boiling until the sauce reduces and thickens.    transfer the finished pig feet and sauce to individual serving dishes and enjoy them while they re still hot.    bring the water to a boil over medium high heat  then cook the pig feet for 2 or 3 minutes.   clean the pig feet and remove any hairs before beginning. parboiling the pig feet in this manner should help reduce any strange aftertaste.    drain the water from the pig feet  then return the pig feet to the pan. add enough fresh water to cover the pig feet by 1 or 2 inches  2.5 to 5 cm   and set the pan back on the stove over medium high heat.    add the garlic  salt  and pepper to the water as it heats. allow the water to reach a rolling boil.   you should notice foam gathering at the surface of the water once it boils. remove this foam with a spoon before continuing.    reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan. allow the pig feet to simmer for 3 to 4 hours  or until the meat is tender enough to fall off the bones.   you should continue to periodically skim off any foam that develops at the surface of the cooking broth. when the pig feet are ready  the broth should also be fairly clear.    pour the contents of the saucepan into four individual serving dishes. use tongs to carefully remove the bones from the meat as you divide it amongst the dishes.note that each dish should contain an equal amount of pork and broth. allow the dishes to sit out and cool down to room temperature before continuing to the next step.    place the dishes of pig feet into a refrigerator. chill for at least 2 hours  or until the mixture solidifies into a jelly like consistency.   the bones  connective tissue  and skin break down during the cooking process  and the by products of these elements reduce down into a natural gelatin. the length of refrigeration may vary depending on how much water you used during the cooking process.    remove the jellied pig feet from the refrigerator and enjoy it cold. you can serve each portion in its molding dish or cut each portion into slices before serving it.

query	221	put on fake eyelash eyelash extensions apply eyelash extensions  before selecting extensions  examine your own lashes. the longer and healthier they are  the more weight they can withstand.   if you ve never applied extensions before  consider starting with a half set to see how your natural lashes hold up. you can always add more extensions later if you want a fuller or more exaggerated look.    mink is the most expensive and synthetic is the least. the lengths usually range from 6mm to 17mm.extensions also come in a variety of thicknesses  curls and colors. think about what your ultimate goal is before making a choice.   for example  if your goal is to create a natural look  you could select medium length extensions in brown black. if you are buying extensions as part of a costume  or if you re going for a unique look  explore different color options and thicknesses.    once you ve settled on a basic length and thickness  choose individual lashes that vary slightly in length. a subtle variation will provide the most natural looking results.three sizes in a similar length range should be sufficient. the shortest extensions will be used to fill in any gaps in the lash line and keep the overall appearance from looking unnatural and crowded.    if you plan to apply the extensions yourself  get a kit from a beauty supply store. a kit will include different sized lashes  usually short  medium and long   along with all the tools you ll need for application   tweezers  adhesive  adhesive remover and an eyelash brush. if you ve never applied extensions before  buying a kit will make the process a lot easier.   each kit is different. read and follow the instructions included with the kit carefully. check the ingredients on the adhesive. make sure it doesn t have formaldehyde listed as an ingredient.    applying eyelash extensions on yourself can be risky  since the adhesive can irritate your skin or damage your natural lashes if not applied properly. if you don t feel comfortable applying extensions yourself  find a certified professional to do it for you the first time.   after going through the process once  you ll probably feel more at ease doing it at home. start by researching technicians in your area. make sure they re licensed and find out how long they ve been doing this professionally.  if this is your first time applying extensions  it s a good idea to have a friend nearby to help you out. the application process requires that you juggle several different tools and  when it comes to actually gluing the extensions on  you need to be completely still. your eye also needs to be completely shut when you glue it on  and all of this is difficult to do with just two hands.   the application process will go much faster and more smoothly with an assistant. it will also be a lot safer for you. there is a higher risk of getting adhesive in your eye and other mishaps when you re working alone.    for the adhesive to stick properly  your natural lashes must be clean and free of makeup residue. they also need to be completely dry. start by applying makeup remover to a cotton pad and gently swiping it across both eyes. remove every trace of makeup around the eye area. rinse the area with lukewarm water.          allow your eyelashes to dry before you begin applying the extensions. comb your upper lashes with an eyelash brush to smooth and separate them. this brush  which looks like a mascara wand  should come with your extension kit.    your extension kit should include some sort of gel pad or tape to help pat down the bottom lashes. this will protect your skin from the adhesive. the adhesive pad also makes it easier to see and work on the individual lashes. when your eyelid is closed  the upper lashes will be against the white color  emphasizing the areas where you re working.           since you re starting at the outermost corner of your eye  your longest extensions will be used first. squeeze a dime sized amount of lash adhesive onto a smooth surface that s easily accessible for you. then use the tweezers to grab your first cluster and carefully dip the knotted end in the adhesive.          you only need a tiny amount of glue. if you use too much  the end result will look messy.  slowly drop the synthetic lash onto your natural lash  as close to the base of your eyelashes as possible. the glue should only touch your lash  not your skin. once the extension is dropped onto your natural lash  you will have about 60 seconds to situate it before the glue sets.          after you do one eye  do the same for the other. you will work back and forth to ensure both eyes look even. the glue can cause eyelid irritation if it touches your skin. make sure the glue touches your natural lashes only.    for the most natural look  the longest extensions will go on the outer edges. continue until you ve applied three to four of the longest extensions to the outer third of both eyes. make sure the extensions aren t too close together  since you will be filling in between them with shorter pieces.          use the tweezers to adjust each extension as needed within the first 60 seconds of dropping it.    work from the outside corners inward  just as you did before. be sure to do one eye  then the other. work back and forth so both eyes look even.          as you work  use the tweezers to periodically push the applied extensions down onto your natural lashes. this will help you keep everything in place. take your time. extension application is not a quick process.    use the medium length extensions and place three to four of them on your lashes. continue to work from the outside in. cover the middle third of your eyelid on both sides.           the short ones can be a little harder to work with  so just go in as far as you can. then use the shortest extensions to fill in any empty spaces you see in the middle sections of both eyes.           do not apply any mascara or eye makeup for several hours after application. if possible  try not to touch the extensions at all. give freshly applied extensions at least 12 to 24 hours before getting them wet. the life of your extensions will vary based on the type and how well they were applied  but they should last anywhere from two to eight weeks.professionally applied extensions should last through one growth cycle. this varies from person to person  but it s usually about six to eight weeks.    use an eyelash brush or a clean mascara wand to gently brush them out every morning. try to sleep on your back at night. this will cut down on the amount of time you need to spend every morning combing them out.           mascara applied to the base of the extensions usually ends up getting clumpy.   do not curl your eyelashes before you apply mascara. this can pull the extensions out. avoid water proof mascara completely. it s too hard to remove.do not wear oil based mascara with eyelash extensions  as this can loosen the adhesive.    invest in a high quality remover that requires that you rub as little as possible. use the makeup remover or pre moistened wipes to completely remove your makeup every day. avoid oil based makeup removers  which can loosen the adhesive. makeup must be removed very gently to avoid pulling off the extensions.           if you lose any pieces very early on  try to use a bit of mascara to conceal the gaps. a touch up every three to four weeks will keep your extensions looking full and at their best. you can also do maintenance as needed  adding new pieces on as you lose the originals.
