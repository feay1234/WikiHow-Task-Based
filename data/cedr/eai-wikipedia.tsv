query	INEX_LD-2009039	ancient roman architecture adopted the external language of classical greek architecture for the purposes of the ancient romans, but was different from greek buildings, becoming a new architectural style. the two styles are often considered one body of classical architecture. roman architecture flourished in the roman republic and even more so under the empire, when the great majority of surviving buildings were constructed. it used new materials, particularly concrete, and newer technologies such as the arch and the dome to make buildings that were typically strong and well engineered. large numbers remain in some form across the empire, sometimes complete and still in use to this day. roman architecture covers the period from the establishment of the roman republic in 509 bc to about the 4th century ad, after which it becomes reclassified as late antique or byzantine architecture. almost no substantial examples survive from before about 100 bc, and most of the major survivals are from the later empire, after about 100 ad.  roman architectural style continued to influence building in the former empire for many centuries, and the style used in western europe beginning about 1000 is called romanesque architecture to reflect this dependence on basic roman forms. the romans only began to achieve significant originality in architecture around the beginning of the imperial period, after they had combined aspects of their original etruscan architecture with others taken from greece, including most elements of the style we now call classical architecture. they moved from trabeated construction mostly based on columns and lintels to one based on massive walls, punctuated by arches, and later domes, both of which greatly developed under the romans. the classical orders now became largely decorative rather than structural, except in colonnades. stylistic developments included the tuscan and composite orders  the first being a shortened, simplified variant on the doric order and the composite being a tall order with the floral decoration of the corinthian and the scrolls of the ionic. the period from roughly 40 bc to about 230 ad saw most of the greatest achievements, before the crisis of the third century and later troubles reduced the wealth and organizing power of the central government. the romans produced massive public buildings and works of civil engineering, and were responsible for significant developments in housing and public hygiene, for example their public and private baths and latrines, under floor heating in the form of the hypocaust, mica glazing  examples in ostia antica , and piped hot and cold water  examples in pompeii and ostia

query	INEX_LD-20120112	the vietnam war  vietnamese  chi n tranh vi t nam , also known as the second indochina war, and in vietnam as the resistance war against america  vietnamese  kh ng chi n ch ng m   or simply the american war, was a conflict in vietnam, laos, and cambodia from 1 november 1955 to the fall of saigon on 30 april 1975. it was the second of the indochina wars and was officially fought between north vietnam and south vietnam. north vietnam was supported by the soviet union, china, and other communist allies  south vietnam was supported by the united states, south korea, the philippines, australia, thailand and other anti communist allies. the war, considered a cold war era proxy war by some, lasted 19 years, with direct u.s. involvement ending in 1973, and included the laotian civil war and the cambodian civil war, which ended with all three countries becoming communist in 1975. the conflict emerged from the first indochina war against the communist led viet minh. most of the funding for the french war effort was provided by the u.s. after the french quit indochina in 1954, the us assumed financial and military support for the south vietnamese state. the vi t c ng, also known as front national de lib ration du sud vi t nam or nlf  the national liberation front , a south vietnamese common front under the direction of north vietnam, initiated a guerrilla war in the south. north vietnam had also invaded laos in the mid 1950s in support of insurgents, establishing the ho chi minh trail to supply and reinforce the vi t c ng. u.s. involvement escalated under president john f. kennedy through the maag program from just under a thousand military advisors in 1959 to 16,000 in 1963. by 1963, the north vietnamese had sent 40,000 soldiers to fight in south vietnam. north vietnam was heavily backed by the ussr and the people s republic of china. china also sent hundreds of pla servicemen to north vietnam to serve in air defense and support roles.by 1964, there were 23,000 us advisors in south vietnam. in august, the gulf of tonkin incident occurred, in which a u.s. destroyer was alleged to have clashed with north vietnamese fast attack craft. in response, the u.s congress passed the gulf of tonkin resolution, giving president lyndon b. johnson broad authorization to increase u.s. military presence. he ordered the deployment of combat units for the first time and increased troop levels to 184,000. past this point, the people s army of vietnam  pavn   also known as the north vietnamese army or nva  engaged in more conventional warfare with u.s and south vietnamese forces. every year onward, there was significant build up of u.s forces, despite little progress. u.s secretary of defense robert mcnamara, one of the principal architects of the war, began expressing doubts of victory by the end of 1966. u.s. and south vietnam forces relied on air superiority and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and destroy operations, involving ground forces, artillery, and airstrikes. the u.s. also conducted a large scale strategic bombing campaign against north vietnam and laos. the tet offensive of 1968 showed the lack of progress with these doctrines. with the vc and pavn mounting large scale urban offensives throughout 1968, u.s domestic support for the war began fading. the army of the republic of vietnam  arvn  expanded following a period of neglect after tet and was modeled after u.s doctrine. the vc sustained heavy losses during the tet offensive and subsequent u.s. arvn operations in the rest of 1968, losing over 50,000 men. the cia s phoenix program further degraded the vc s membership and capabilities. by the end of the year, the vc insurgents held almost no territory in south vietnam, and their recruitment dropped by over 80  in 1969, signifying a drastic reduction in guerrilla operations, necessitating increased use of pavn regular soldiers from the north. in 1969, north vietnam declared a provisional revolutionary government in south vietnam in an attempt to give the reduced vc a more international stature, but the southern guerrillas from then on were sidelined as pavn forces begun more conventional combined arms warfare. operations crossed national borders  laos was invaded by north vietnam early on, while cambodia was used by north vietnam as a supply route starting in 1967  the route through cambodia began to be bombed by the u.s. in 1969, while the laos route had been heavily bombed since 1964. the deposing of the monarch norodom sihanouk by the cambodian national assembly resulted in a pavn invasion of the country at the request of the khmer rouge, escalating the cambodian civil war and resulting in a u.s. rvn counter invasion. in 1969, following the election of u.s president richard nixon, a policy of  vietnamization  began, which saw the conflict fought by an expanded arvn, with u.s. forces sidelined and increasingly demoralized by domestic opposition and reduced recruitment. u.s. ground forces had largely withdrawn by early 1972 and support was limited to air support, artillery support, advisers, and materiel shipments. the arvn, buttressed by said u.s. support, stopped the largest and first mechanized pavn offensive to date during the easter offensive of 1972, which had sustained heavy casualties on both sides but failed to recapture all territory, leaving its military situation difficult. the paris peace accords saw all u.s forces withdrawn  the case church amendment, passed by the u.s congress on 15 august 1973, ended direct u.s military involvement. the peace accords were broken almost immediately, and fighting continued for two more years. phnom penh fell to the khmer rouge on 17 april 1975 while the 1975 spring offensive saw the capture of saigon by the pavn on 30 april  this marked the end of the war, and north and south vietnam were reunified the following year. the scale of fighting was enormous  by 1970 the arvn was the world s fourth largest army, with the pavn being similar in size at around a million regular soldiers. the war exacted a huge human cost in terms of fatalities  see vietnam war casualties   estimates of the number of vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 966,000 to 3.8 million. some 275,000 310,000 cambodians, 20,000 62,000 laotians, and 58,220 u.s. service members also died in the conflict, and a further 1,626 remain missing in action.the sino soviet split re emerged following the lull during the vietnam war. conflict between north vietnam and its cambodian allies in the royal government of the national union of kampuchea, and the newly formed democratic kampuchea begun almost immediately in a series of border raids by the khmer rouge, eventually escalating into the cambodian vietnamese war. chinese forces directly invaded vietnam in the sino vietnamese war, with subsequent border conflicts lasting until 1991. insurgencies were fought by the unified vietnam in all three countries. the end of the war and resumption of the third indochina war would precipitate the vietnamese boat people and the larger indochina refugee crisis, which saw millions of refugees leave indochina  mainly southern vietnam , with an estimated 250,000 of whom perished at sea. within the u.s, the war gave rise to what was referred to as vietnam syndrome, a public aversion to american overseas military involvements, which together with the watergate scandal contributed to the crisis of confidence that affected america throughout the 1970s.

query	INEX_LD-2012337	the 1953 waco tornado outbreak was a series of at least 33 tornadoes occurring in 10 different u.s. states on may 9 11, 1953. tornadoes appeared daily from minnesota in the north to texas in the south. the strongest and deadliest tornado of the severe weather event was a powerful f5 on the fujita scale. it struck waco, texas, on may 11, causing 114 of the 144 deaths in the outbreak. alongside the 1902 tornado in goliad, it was the deadliest tornado in texas history and is the eleventh deadliest tornado in u.s. history. the tornado s winds demolished more than 600 houses, 1,000 other structures, and over 2,000 vehicles. nearly 600 injuries occurred, and many survivors had to wait more than 14 hours for rescue. the destruction dispelled a myth that the geography of the region spared waco from tornadoes, and along with other deadly tornadoes in 1953, the waco disaster was a catalyst for advances in understanding the link between tornadoes and radar detected hook echoes. it also generated support for improved civil defense systems, the formation of weather radar networks, and improved communications between stakeholders such as meteorologists, local officials, and the public. the waco tornado was not the only deadly and damaging tornado in the outbreak sequence. on the same day as the waco disaster, a high end f4 tornado struck the texas city of san angelo, causing catastrophic damage, killing 13 people, and injuring more than 150. the tornado swept away numerous homes and damaged a school, but students inside escaped serious injuries. on may 9, a long tracked f3 tornado destroyed a large swath of hebron, nebraska, and killed five people in the area. the following day, may 10, featured numerous, often long tracked and intense tornado families across the states of iowa, minnesota, and wisconsin. two families on nearly parallel paths traveled more than 100 miles  160 km  each and killed a combined total of six people, mostly in wisconsin. at least one of the tornado families reached f4 intensity in wisconsin. two other f4 tornadoes also struck iowa. additionally, a relatively moderate tornado of f2 intensity caused significant loss of life in a shack in minnesota, killing six people. although 33 tornadoes were officially registered from may 9 11, others likely occurred but either went undetected or were not officially documented.

query	QALD2_tr-10	fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products.  slower oxidative processes like rusting or digestion are not included by this definition. fire is hot because the conversion of the weak double bond in molecular oxygen, o2, to the stronger bonds in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water releases energy  418 kj per 32 g of o2   the bond energies of the fuel play only a minor role here.  at a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced.  the flame is the visible portion of the fire. flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen.  if hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma. depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire s intensity will be different. fire in its most common form can result in conflagration, which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning.  fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe. the positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems. the negative effects of fire include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination. if fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water. also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil. this loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long term reduction in the fertility of the soil, but this fecundity can potentially be recovered as molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere is  fixed  and converted to ammonia by natural phenomena such as lightning and by leguminous plants that are  nitrogen fixing  such as clover, peas, and green beans. fire has been used by humans in rituals, in agriculture for clearing land, for cooking, generating heat and light, for signaling, propulsion purposes, smelting, forging, incineration of waste, cremation, and as a weapon or mode of destruction.

query	SemSearch_ES-21	charles robert darwin,     12 february 1809   19 april 1882  was an english naturalist, geologist and biologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. his proposition that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors is now widely accepted, and considered a foundational concept in science. in a joint publication with alfred russel wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and he was honoured by burial in westminster abbey.darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book on the origin of species. by the 1870s, the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact. however, many favoured competing explanations which gave only a minor role to natural selection, and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. darwin s scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.darwin s early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the university of edinburgh  instead, he helped to investigate marine invertebrates. studies at the university of cambridge  christ s college  encouraged his passion for natural science. his five year voyage on hms beagle established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported charles lyell s conception of gradual geological change, and publication of his journal of the voyage made him famous as a popular author.puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, darwin began detailed investigations, and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection. although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. he was writing up his theory in 1858 when alfred russel wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of both of their theories. darwin s work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature. in 1871 he examined human evolution and sexual selection in the descent of man, and selection in relation to sex, followed by the expression of the emotions in man and animals  1872 . his research on plants was published in a series of books, and in his final book, the formation of vegetable mould, through the actions of worms  1881 , he examined earthworms and their effect on soil.
